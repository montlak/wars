<p class="Body-Text">"Discrimination on the basis of a handicapping condition is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and proven by the employee who asserts it." <span class="Italic">Burnette v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 230, 232 (1982). <span class="Italic">Pugh v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 313, 321 &#x00B6; 14 (1999), explained the general elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> disability discrimination case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the necessary elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination will vary according to the particular facts and circumstances at issue, they generally include: a showing that the person is a disabled person and the action appealed was based on his disability; and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned<span class="Italic">. Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988). A disabled person is one who "(i) [h]as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (ii) [h]as a record of such an impairment; or (iii) [i]s regarded as having such an impairment." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Yates v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 178 (1996)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant may introduce evidence of his disability for the first time at the Board hearing, for that hearing is <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Konieczko v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 509, 514 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board set out the elements of proof required to establish disability discrimination in a performance case, first reviewed by an arbitrator, involving a disability of anxiety or depression, and concluded that the appellant failed to demonstrate entitlement to an accommodation, <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp</span>., CB-7121-12-0013-V-1 (NP 5/16/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In August 2010, the agency proposed the appellant's removal from her position as a Management Analyst under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 for failing to demonstrate a minimally acceptable level of performance during her performance improvement plan (PIP) period based on her failure to meet three critical elements. The agency effected her removal on October 14, 2010, and gave her notice of her rights to appeal the decision under the negotiated grievance procedure or to the Board. She chose to grieve her removal under the negotiated grievance procedure, and a hearing before an arbitrator was held on May 20, July 19, July 20, August 1, and August 29, 2011. The arbitrator found that the agency proved that the Office of Personnel Management approved its performance appraisal system, that the agency properly communicated the performance standards and critical elements, that the performance standards were reasonable, and that the appellant did not meet any of the critical elements during the period of the PIP. He further found that the appellant was qualified for the position and that the agency adequately provided training and addressed performance issues. Finally, the arbitrator found that the appellant's reasonable accommodation claim was untimely, and he did not address it on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's decision under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) when the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant has alleged discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action, and a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">Kirkland v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). Each of these conditions has been satisfied in this case. First, the appellant's grievance concerns her removal for unacceptable performance, a subject matter over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(e); <span class="Italic">Galloway v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). Second, the appellant alleged in her grievance and alleges in this request for review that the agency's action was based on disability discrimination. Finally, the arbitrator has issued a final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's standard of review of an arbitration decision is deferential. <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 12. The Board will modify or set aside an arbitration decision only when the arbitrator has erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant does not object to the arbitrator's findings concerning her failure to demonstrate a minimally acceptable level of performance during her PIP period, and we discern no reason to disturb those findings. The appellant's arguments concern her reasonable accommodation claim and her assertion that the agency's action did not promote the efficiency of the service. We address each in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not prove her affirmative defense of disability discrimination</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to process her request for a reasonable accommodation. An employer commits unlawful disability discrimination by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee" unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(A). An appellant may establish a disability discrimination claim based on failure to accommodate by showing that: (1) She is a disabled person; (2) the action appealed was based on her disability; and (3) to the extent possible, there was a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned.[5] <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 18. In addition, once an employee informs the agency that she requires an accommodation, the agency must engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span id="Page_3433"></span><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather the appellant must show that this omission resulted in failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 18 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As a federal employee, the appellant's claim arises under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but the regulatory standards for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act and are applied to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 18 n.5. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) became effective on January 1, 2009, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission subsequently issued amended regulations and guidance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ADAAA did not change the statutory provisions regarding reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADAAA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). The ADAAA defines "qualified individual," in part, to mean "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). The ADAAA defines "disability" to mean: "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3))." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A)-(C). "Major Life Activities" include, but are not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC's) ADAAA regulations provide that the term "'substantially limits' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADAAA. 'Substantially limits' is also not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i). "An impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "The comparison of an individual's performance of a major life activity to the performance of the same major life activity by most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(v). The term "reasonable accommodation" includes job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials, or policies; the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite a full and fair opportunity to develop the record concerning her disability discrimination claim based on a failure to accommodate, the appellant failed to demonstrate that the action appealed was based on her disability or that there was a reasonable accommodation under which she believed she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(A). In support of her claim, the appellant identifies two letters from her doctor, Felton Anderson, dated August 20, 2009, and August 24, 2009. The August 20, 2009 letter states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have been [the appellant's] attending physician since June 2008. She is currently being treated for anxiety and depression. Due to these conditions it is imperative that she receive special accommodations and restoration of her leave immediately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The August 24, 2009 letter states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have been [the appellant's] attending physician since June 2008. Due to the overwhelming stress that my patient is experiencing, at this time I am requesting that [the appellant] be allowed to work no more than three days a week for the next 30 days. After that time she will be reevaluated. This is to be effective immediately. Her limited work schedule will allow us to properly gage the benefits of her new therapy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It has come to my attention that [the appellant's] sick coverage is depleted. Please provide her coverage from the company sick leave bank.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These documents, and the appellant's brief testimony that she was depressed, stressed, and "dealing with anxiety on medication" are the only significant pieces of evidence in the record concerning the appellant's medical condition. Although the appellant did not include any documents concerning diagnoses, treatment, duration of her condition, severity of her condition, or how it affects a major life activity, we still find that she demonstrated that she was "disabled" under the ADAAA's expansive definition of the term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that she submitted both letters from Dr. Anderson to her supervisor, Jane Tamai, in August 2009. She also testified that Ms. Tamai then requested more information. According to the record, Ms. Tamai responded by email on August 27, 2009, to inquire whether the appellant intended to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and to indicate that the agency required further information from the doctor regarding medical certification under the FMLA. The record also reflects that the appellant responded by stating that she was requesting advanced leave, that she would forward Ms. Tamai's request to her physician and attorney, and that she would respond to Ms. Tamai once she received an update. Instead, on September 18, 2009, the union submitted a demand to bargain, stating that the agency violated the ADA when Ms. Tamai asked the appellant to submit updated medical history and information concerning her request for reasonable accommodation.[7] The appellant did not submit further documentation concerning her medical condition. Further, the record does not contain any evidence about how her medical condition affected her ability to perform her job or how an accommodation would have allowed her to perform the essential duties of her job or of a vacant position to which she could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 18 (2010). Given the appellant's failure to cooperate with Ms. Tamai when she reasonably requested additional information on the appellant's medical condition, we find that the appellant has failed to establish a disability discrimination claim based on a failure to accommodate. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2010) (finding that the appellant did not prove that he was denied a reasonable accommodation in part because he was not responsive to the agency's requests for medical information); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#requesting">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html#requesting</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#requesting">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#requesting</a>] (question 6) (the employer may ask for reasonable documentation about the disability and functional limitations because the employer is entitled to know that the individual has a covered disability for which she needs a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The record also contains an Accommodation Request Form indicating that the appellant had a temporary psychiatric disability and needed an altered work schedule. The testimony of Sheila Wilson, the union representative, regarding the timing of these forms is not clear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's argument that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process, the appellant asserts that Ms. Tamai acknowledged that she was not familiar with laws governing reasonable accommodation, and that the union's demand to bargain over the appellant's request for a reasonable accommodation went unanswered).[8] An agency's failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather, the appellant must show that this omission resulted in failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 18. In any event, although Ms. Tamai perceived the appellant's request for unpaid leave as an action under the FMLA and not a formal request for reasonable accommodation, her actions still reasonably fulfilled the agency's initial obligation to engage in the interactive process. Furthermore, it was the appellant's refusal to provide additional medical documentation that cut off the process; therefore, the appellant has not shown that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process. In addition, the appellant did not submit argument or evidence concerning how a reduced schedule or any other accommodation would have allowed her to perform in her position or in any other vacant position to which she could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Ms. Wilson testified that the union did not file a grievance over the asserted refusal to accommodate the appellant or the demand to bargain. After filing a grievance over the appellant's removal on November 1, 2010, the union amended the grievance to include the disability discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, contrary to the appellant's bare assertion concerning violations of the agency's policy, it appears that Ms. Tamai did have the authority, <span id="Page_3434"></span>per agency policy, to both process the appellant's request and gather sufficient information or documentation to determine that the appellant had a disability. Thus, we find that the appellant has failed to establish a disability discrimination claim based on a failure to accommodate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another Chapter 43 decision, <span class="Italic">Mallory v. USDA,</span> DC-0432-13-0347-I-2 (NP 6/8/2015), emphasized the importance of either an agency's knowledge of a disability (and failure to accommodate) or proof that the agency discriminated against the employee on the basis of the disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to establish her disability discrimination claim because she has not provided evidence that the agency knew she had a learning disability or back disorder, that she requested a reasonable accommodation for either condition, or that her removal was based on either condition. <span class="Italic">See Sanders</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 16....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 637, 647, 6 MSPB 536 (1981), adopted the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> order of proof for disability discrimination cases involving removal of employees. If the appellant establishes that he is a qualified disabled person for purposes of employment and the agency failed to accommodate his condition, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination is established. The appellant demonstrates that he is a qualified disabled person by showing that he fits the definition of 29 CFR 1630.2(m) (2022) [previously situated at 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1) (1999) and earlier at 29 CFR 1613.702(a)] and by articulating a reasonable accommodation that allows him to perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of himself and others. The Board must conduct a detailed analysis of the appellant's position and his limitations. Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the burden of going forward with the evidence, although not the ultimate burden of persuasion on discrimination, shifts to the agency to demonstrate that its action was based on a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. This may include demonstrating that accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency program. The desired accommodation for Mr. Stalkfleet was a modified work schedule for his job, city carrier, and a few modifications in his duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet</span> provided the Board's first extensive examination of the implications of the Rehabilitation Act for employees needing job modifications, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 645-48:</p>

Ed.2d 184 (1979), in holding that the EEOC had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in not hiring a physically handicapped applicant for employment who brought suit under section 501 of the Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791, found it necessary to examine the position descriptions of the jobs in issue in addition to the sworn affidavits of agency officials in order to determine that the EEOC had properly considered the appellant's qualifications in relation to the legitimate job requirements in deciding that the appellant could not perform the primary duties and responsibilities of the job he sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such an examination of the legitimate job requirements and duties set forth in the City Carrier position description is essential to the resolution of this case. The agency has indicated that the duties of a mounted carrier, requiring less walking and exposure to inclement weather, are identical to those in appellant's City Carrier position. Further, there is strong evidence that appellant may be able to safely and efficiently perform the duties of his position under a restructured schedule of casing mail and mounted or special delivery so as to be a "qualified handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f). If appellant is capable of performing the essential functions of his City Carrier position, based on the legitimate requirements of the position, with reasonable accommodation by the agency and without endangering the health and safety of himself or others, he meets the requirements of a "qualified handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f). Under these circumstances, it is clear that, pursuant to 29 USC &#x00A7; 791 and 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704, the agency would be required to reasonably accommodate appellant's physical handicap "unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(a).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Such a demonstration of undue hardship by the agency, in addition to the factors set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(c), may include a showing by the agency that any job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, or other reasonable accommodation, may violate the express terms of the National Agreement. <span class="Italic">See Donaldson v. Postal Service,</span> 4 MSPB 62, 63, 3 MSPR 543, 545 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record is insufficiently developed to determine whether appellant is a "qualified handicapped person," 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f), entitled to "reasonable accommodation," 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704, a remand to the presiding official for further development of the record on these matters and a new initial decision is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Donaldson v.

The head of each such agency shall promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendments to this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed regulation shall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress, and such regulation may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day after the date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that section 501 of the Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791, is also intended to be part of the general corpus of discrimination law.[6] The analysis utilized in establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is, therefore, applicable to discrimination based on physical or mental handicap under section 501 of the Act. The Board recognizes, as did the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, supra,</span> 411 U.S. 802 n.13, 93 S.

However, for purposes of this removal action, if appellant establishes that he is a "qualified handicapped person," 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f), for purposes of employment, and that the agency has failed to accommodate his handicap condition, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case raising an inference of handicap discrimination by the agency will be established. Appellant may establish that he is a "qualified handicapped person" with respect to employment if he shows that he is a "handicapped person" within the definition of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a), and if, to the extent possible, he articulates a reasonable accommodation under which he can perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of himself and others.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the burden of going forward with the evidence, although not the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of discrimination, shifts to the agency to demonstrate that its action was based on some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, supra,</span> 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148,] at 151-55 (1988), the Board explained that an appellant who alleges handicap discrimination has the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. To do so, the appellant must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, generally by the following: (1) Showing that he is a handicapped person under [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6)] and that the action appealed to the Board was based on his handicap; and (2) to the extent possible, articulating a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency has the burden of showing that its action was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To maintain either a failure to accommodate claim or a disability-based disparate treatment claim, an appellant must show that he was a qualified individual with a disability at the time of the alleged unlawful discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A14669, 2003 WL 660615, at *3 (E.E.O.C. Feb. 21, 2003); <span class="Italic">see also Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 23 (2002). A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability "who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); <span class="Italic">see Henson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated, it is undisputed that a valid CDL was required for the performance of the appellant's job duties as a Motor Vehicle Operator. Thus, by losing his CDL, the appellant failed to maintain a requirement of his position that was necessary to perform his essential duties. Because he was no longer technically qualified for his position, we find that, at the time of the agency's removal action, the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Malbouf v. Department of the Army</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 588, 591-92 (1990) (the agency was not obligated to accommodate the appellant because he was not a qualified individual with a disability due to his failure to maintain a driver's license, a condition of employment necessary to perform his job duties). Accordingly, we modify the initial decision to find that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability who could assert either a denial of reasonable accommodation claim or a disability-based disparate treatment claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant was a qualified individual with a disability, the record contains no evidence that that the appellant's removal was based on his disability or that the agency treated similarly situated nondisabled employees differently. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to identify another Motor Vehicle Operator who was not removed for failure to possess a required CDL and that the comparators identified by the appellant were not similarly situated because, among other things, they had both maintained a valid CDL. The administrative judge further found that there was no connection between the appellant's disability and his removal because his failure to maintain a valid CDL was due to unresolved tickets and fines, not his medical condition and, in any event, the denial of a CDL was not a decision over which the agency had any control....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant must rely on indirect evidence to establish his disability discrimination claim, i.e., where the agency alleges that it was unaware that he was disabled, or that the action was taken for a reason unrelated to the alleged disability, the legal analysis will follow the burden-shifting framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">Corp. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Disability discrimination claims, however, generally involve direct, rather than indirect, evidence that the agency took the appellant's mental or physical condition into account in making its decision. We note that the Supreme Court developed the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas/Burdine</span> burden-shifting analysis as a method of proof on the element of the employer's subjective intent, where no direct evidence of such intent exists....&#8197;Therefore, it is inapplicable where there is direct evidence of discrimination, i.e., where, as here, the agency acknowledges that the appellant was disabled, and that the disability was the basis for his removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 841-42; <span class="Italic">Barth v. Gelb</span>, 2 F.3d 1180, 1185 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 511 U.S. 1030, 114 S. Ct. 1538, 128 L. Ed.2d 190 (1994). Similarly, it is inapplicable in cases where an appellant alleges that an agency's facially neutral policy or practice affects disabled individuals in a significantly discriminatory manner, or that a job function deemed "essential" by the agency is not essential. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Monette</span>, 90 F.3d at 1178 n.5, 1184. In such cases, a different inquiry is required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In setting forth the appropriate analytical framework for cases involving direct evidence of disability discrimination, it is necessary to <span id="Page_3436"></span>distinguish between those cases in which the appellant alleges that he can perform the essential functions of the position without reasonable accommodation, and those in which the appellant concedes that he cannot perform the essential functions of the position without reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Monette</span>, 90 F.3d at 1182-83. In the first type of case, objective evidence will usually be sufficient to establish whether the appellant's disability renders him unqualified to perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Alternatively, where the appellant seeks some form of accommodation, he must show that he is a disabled person, and that the action appealed was based on his disability, and, to the extent possible, he must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 493 (1995); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must produce evidence to rebut the appellant's claim. If the employer claims that the disabled individual is unqualified to perform the job, even with the proposed accommodation, the disabled individual must prove that he would, in fact, be qualified to perform the essential elements of the job if the employer were to adopt the proposed accommodation, and that the proposed accommodation is objectively reasonable. The burden of proof remains with the appellant in such a case. <span class="Italic">See Monette</span>, 90 F.3d at 1183. If the appellant does prove that he can perform his job, however, or a position to which he can be reassigned, with reasonable accommodation, and/or the agency concedes this point, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that the reasonable accommodation at issue would create an undue hardship. In determining whether a proposed accommodation would create an undue hardship for the agency, the Board will consider: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the nature and composition of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and cost of the accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.704(c); <span class="Italic">Barth</span>, 2 F.3d at 1186-87. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Monette:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Put simply, if the employer claims that a proposed accommodation will impose an undue hardship, the employer must prove that fact. If the employer claims instead that the disabled individual would be unqualified to perform the essential functions of the job even with the proposed accommodation, the disabled individual must prove that he or she would in fact be qualified for the job if the employer were to adopt the proposed accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1184.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the appellant must prove that he is a qualified person with disabilities, i.e., a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and/or safety of himself and/or others. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a); <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 387, 395 (1992). However, to meet his burden of proof with respect to establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where, as here, it is undisputed that the appellant could not perform his job without some form of reasonable accommodation, the appellant need merely <span class="Italic">articulate a reasonable accommodation</span> under which he believes he could perform the necessary duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be assigned. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 142, 147-48 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 52 MSPR 541, 545 (1992), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 21 F.3d 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Nordquist v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 244, 246 (1988). In this case, as noted above, it is undisputed that the appellant suffered from a physical impairment, i.e., degenerative disc disease, resulting in chronic lower back pain. It is further undisputed that, as a consequence of his impairment, the appellant is substantially limited in the major life activities of lifting, sitting, standing, and bending. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1)-(3). Further, the agency regarded him as having such an impairment<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. There is also no question that the appellant's disability caused his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching its determination with respect to the appellant's ability to perform the essential functions of his position with accommodation, the agency is obligated to fully assess the appellant's medical condition, his job skills, the work environment, and the agency's resources. <span class="Italic">See McKinney v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01940021 (Mar. 16, 1995); <span class="Italic">see also Hall v. USPS</span>, 857 F.2d 1073, 1080 (6th Cir. 1988) (the burden is on the employer to present credible evidence that a reasonable accommodation is not possible in a particular situation; determining whether the employer has demonstrated that the proffered accommodation imposes an undue hardship on its operations requires an individualized inquiry to ensure that the employer's justifications reflect a well-informed judgment grounded in a careful and open-minded weighing of the risks and alternatives); <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1422-24 (9th Cir. 1985) (before excluding an individual from the workplace on the basis of his disabling condition, the employer must independently assess both the probability and severity of potential injury to the individual which might be expected to result from his employment in a particular position; absent such an independent assessment, a good faith or rational belief on the part of the employer that the disabled individual cannot safely perform in a particular position will not be a sufficient defense to an allegation of discrimination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, an appellant is not required to prove conclusively that specific job modifications are reasonable. Rather, he is only required to make a facial showing that his disability can be reasonably accommodated<span class="Italic">. See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 152 n.4 (citing <span class="Italic">Treadwell v. Alexander</span>, 707 F.2d 473, 478 (11th Cir. 1983)). The agency is generally expected to know more about the job duties and its ability to make modifications. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">(citing Prewitt v. USPS</span>, 662 F.2d 292, 308 (5th Cir. 1981)). Thus, the appellant need only present evidence as to his or her individual capabilities and suggestions for job modifications. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Frank</span>, 949 F.2d 637, 642 (2d Cir. 1991). He is obligated, however, to make a good faith effort to work with his employer to determine what constitutes a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Beck v.</span> <span class="Italic">University of Wisconsin Board of Regents</span>, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135-36 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record supports a finding that the appellant has sufficiently articulated a number of reasonable accommodations under which he can perform his current job or a position to which he could be reassigned. He suggested a number of specific modifications, such as top loading the mail utility carts, raising the OCR equipment which he operated, and periodic sitting. The appellant further suggested using taller mail containers, rotating to manual distribution at a letter case, and reducing the weight of letter trays so as not to exceed twenty pounds. Moreover, the appellant suggested modifying his position to allow him to work at a slower pace when performing the sweeper functions, modifying the post-con with a lever to eliminate the need for bending, and receiving assistance from the feeders if the stacks became full.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Warrick testified that top loading the mail utility carts, as suggested by the appellant, would be a safety hazard, because it would make them top heavy, and cause them to tip over easily. Similarly, he stated that using modified post-cons would require transferring mail from nonmodified to modified equipment. Moreover, he stated that raising the OCR, another suggested accommodation, would be impractical for the other employees, particularly the shorter employees, who would have to reach and stretch farther, and that it would make it more difficult to clear the machine when it jammed. In addition, he testified that there were no manual distribution operations to which the appellant could be rotated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the letter of proposed removal contained only general responses to the appellant's suggested modifications, and did not cite to any ergonomic, medical or cost-related evidence that would support the conclusion that the suggested accommodations would impose an undue hardship. Mr. Warrick and Mr. Anthony Siary, Manager of Distribution Operations, and the agency's deciding official, both testified that they did not identify any possible job modifications on their own and merely responded to the appellant's suggestions, despite their superior understanding of the relevant job duties and parameters for modification. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 662 F.2d at 303. Mr. Warrick admitted that he had never considered suggestions similar to the appellant's in the past, had never asked mailhandlers to top load mail utility carts (as the appellant suggested), and had never considered trying the appellant out at a slower pace. Moreover, there is no evidence that the agency ever conducted independent studies before initiating the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the modifications noted above, the appellant also suggested "work hardening," i.e., muscle strengthening and improved techniques for performing job duties, as a possible accommodation. In a medical report issued in November 1993, the examining physician stated that the appellant "will attend Work Hardening program and re-evaluation with surgeon next month. Prognosis good." Dr. Rogers, who conducted the fitness-for-duty examination, concluded that the appellant should not continue to work as a Mail Processor, but that "[I]t is possible with a work hardening course that he may improve his functional capacity to some degree." Mr. Warrick's affidavit regarding his April 7, 1994, meeting with the appellant also suggests that work hardening was discussed. Mr. Warrick stated that the appellant "acknowledges that repetitive twisting is a factor but that, using proper lifting/turning techniques, he could do so without harm." Dr. Johanning testified that work hardening, in combination with other modifications, would be beneficial. Nevertheless, the appellant's testimony that the agency never sent him to a work-hardening course is undisputed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in his response to the notice of proposed removal, the appellant referred to a report issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). He also submitted this report in connection with his subsequent equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint. The NIOSH report discussed ergonomic hazards, including back disorders, which were associated with the operation of the OCR and similar automated mail processing equipment. Neither Mr. Warrick nor Mr. Siary reviewed the NIOSH report, however. Mr. Siary stated that he <span id="Page_3437"></span>was "sure" that the Safety Department had reviewed the NIOSH report, but the record contains no evidence that the report was referred to or analyzed by that department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, on the basis of the evidence in the record, we find that the agency failed to meet its burden of persuasion with respect to its claim that the requested accommodations would be unduly burdensome. Alternatively, to the extent that the agency argued that the appellant could not safely perform the essential functions of his job with the requested accommodations, or that these accommodations were not "reasonable," the appellant has rebutted the agency's evidence and argument. <span class="Italic">See Vande Zande v. State of Wisconsin Dept. of Admin.</span>, 44 F.3d 538, 543 (7th Cir. 1995) (employee must show that "the accommodation is reasonable in the sense both of efficacy and proportionality to cost). In doing so, however, he has not necessarily shown that the agency's position was 'pretextual.'" Such a showing is not necessary under the analytical framework for establishing disability discrimination applicable to this case. <span class="Italic">See Burns</span>, 91 F.3d at 843; <span class="Italic">Barth</span>, 2 F.3d at 1185.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, the appellant established that he is disabled, i.e., that he suffered from a physical condition that significantly limited him in the major life activities of lifting, sitting, standing, and bending. The agency acknowledged that it was aware of the appellant's disability, and that it was the basis for its removal action. Further, the appellant articulated a number of possible reasonable accommodations. The agency, however, failed to show that the accommodations proposed by the appellant would create an undue hardship, and it made no efforts to determine, on its own, what other forms of accommodation might be possible. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has established a claim of disability discrimination, and is entitled to reinstatement to the Mail Processor position with reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Foland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 92, 96-99 (1997), summarized <span class="Italic">Clark</span> and further explained approaches to proof of disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear whether the appellant is alleging that he has direct proof of discrimination. To the extent that the appellant is arguing that he was not considered for reassignment because his former supervisor did not believe that he could perform the functions of the vacant positions for which he was otherwise qualified, due to his disability, then, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the appellant must show that: (1) He is a disabled person; (2) the action being appealed to the Board was based on his disability; and (3) he can perform the essential functions of the position without accommodation from the agency, or he can perform the actual essential functions of the position with a proposed reasonable accommodation, which he must articulate to the extent possible. The appellant can furthermore challenge whether a function deemed 'essential" by the agency is actually "essential" as defined by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 558-559.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, the appellant does not have direct proof of discrimination, he may establish his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case indirectly, by the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas/Burdine</span> proof scheme. He must show that: (1) He is disabled or perceived as disabled; (2) he is otherwise qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, for the position in question; (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision (which is within the Board's jurisdiction); (4) the agency knew or had reason to know of the appellant's disability, or perceived him as disabled;, and (5) the position remained open while the agency sought other applicants or the appellant was replaced. <span class="Italic">See Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp.</span>, 90 F.3d 1173, 1185-86 (6th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">see also Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 559, 561.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rowe v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-10-0744-I-1 (NP 7/20/2011), briefly described several types of proof indicative of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...She has also described her affirmative defense by alleging the following: she is a preference eligible disabled veteran; the agency knew of her disability; she had several medical issues that had required the use of sick leave while she was employed by the agency; she had requested leave for a scheduled surgery at the time the agency was considering the removal action; the agency's allegations of misconduct against her, and the removal action, were a discriminatory action to prevent her from receiving priority placement and mandatory placement into the position; agency officials repeatedly referred to the appellant's illnesses; and an agency official, Gretchen Leigh, in informing the appellant of the removal action stated that "she had 'good news.' That news was the Appellant no longer had to worry about when she could schedule her surgery, because Ms. Leigh had a letter for her terminating her from Federal Service. So, now she could schedule her surgery whenever she wanted to without regard for workload." We find that the above allegations are sufficient to meet the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> burden of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Paris v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 104 MSPR 331, 336-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-28, 2006 MSPB 362 (2006), discussed the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that may be established through articulation of an accommodation for a disabled employee, the relation of the interactive process that is supposed to more narrowly focus or tailor a possible accommodation, and the appellant's ultimate burden of proving that the suggested accommodation will, in fact, permit him to perform the essential elements of the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employer commits unlawful disability discrimination by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(A).[1] The term "qualified individual with a disability" means "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). The agency argues on review that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant is "disabled," that the appellant did not request reasonable accommodation at the relevant time, and that the appellant did not meet his burden of proving that there was a reasonable accommodation available that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his position. We address each contention in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The cited statutory provision is from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, but the agency is covered by the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 791-794. However, in a 1992 amendment to the Rehabilitation Act, the employment-related portions of the ADA were incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Fraser v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has shown that he is "disabled.</span>"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant here, the term "disability" means, "with respect to an individual[,] ...a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(A); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erroneously made a conclusory finding that the appellant is "disabled." Relying largely upon <span class="Italic">Toyota Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</span>, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), the agency argues that the appellant failed to prove that his medical restrictions substantially limit his ability to perform any major life activity. Instead, the agency contends, the record evidences that the appellant is only incapable of performing prolonged typing, which in and of itself is not a major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Toyota,</span> the Supreme Court indicated that, when addressing the major life activity of performing manual tasks, which is the issue in this appeal, the central inquiry must be whether the employee is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to most people's daily lives, not whether the employee is unable to perform the tasks associated with a particular job. 534 U.S. at 197. The Court further stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individualized assessment of the effect of an impairment is particularly necessary when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person.

While cases of severe carpal tunnel syndrome are characterized by muscle atrophy and extreme sensory deficits, mild cases generally do not have either of these effects and create only intermittent symptoms of numbness and tingling. Carniero, <span class="Italic">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: The Cause Dictates the Treatment</span>, 66 Cleveland Clinic J. Medicine 159, 161-162 (1999)....&#8197;Given these large potential differences in the severity and duration of the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome, an individual's carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis, on its own, does not indicate whether the individual has a disability within the meaning of the ADA.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his analysis of the evidence, the administrative judge properly performed an individualized assessment of the effect of the appellant's impairment. In particular, the administrative judge noted that the medical assessments of the appellant's physical restrictions determined that he can lift up to 5 pounds on only an occasional basis; he is unable to lift 5 pounds above shoulder level; he can only perform simple grasping for a total of 1 hour per day; and he can perform fine manipulation for up to 15 minutes continuously or 45 minutes intermittently. The administrative judge further found that the evidence indicated that the appellant's condition is permanent, and has caused markedly diminished hand strength, decreased range of motion in the hands and wrists, and constant shooting and stabbing pains in the hands, wrists, and elbows. The administrative judge also noted that the appellant reported that <span id="Page_3438"></span>only a few minutes of keyboarding resulted in a recurrence of hand pain and numbness, which caused him to make erroneous double entries on the computer. In addition, the extensive medical documentation in the record establishes that the appellant's carpal tunnel symptoms are severe and substantially limit tasks central to daily life. For example, the functional capacity examination found that the appellant has difficulty climbing stairs because he is not able to tolerate the pressure on his hands required to use the rail. The record also shows that the appellant reported that he has difficulty in dressing himself because of numbness in his hands and that he will drop things, such as a plate, a glass, or a pen, if he looks away or does not concentrate on the item. Thus, the administrative judge was therefore correct to find that the appellant is a disabled person under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>. <span class="Italic">See Kirkland v. Harvey</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A42874, 2005 WL 2492830, at * 3 (2005) (complainant presented sufficient evidence to establish that her disability, carpal tunnel syndrome, substantially limits the major life activities of performing manual tasks and lifting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's claim that the agency should have accommodated his disability by providing him with voice-recognition software is properly before the Board.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant never requested accommodation, and further argues that even if he did, he never asked for the specific accommodation of voice-recognition software.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disability discrimination claim will fail under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act if the employee never requested accommodation while employed. <span class="Italic">Ballard v. Rubin</span>, 284 F.3d 957, 964 (8th Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Robin v. Espo Engineering Corp.</span>, 200 F.3d 1081, 1092 (7th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Crandall v.

Nevertheless, an employee only has a general responsibility to inform his employer that he needs accommodation for a medical condition. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630 App. &#x00A7; 1630.9. Once the employee has requested accommodation, the employer must engage in the interactive process in an effort to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3); <span class="Italic">Gantt</span>, 143 F.3d at 1046; <span class="Italic">see also Fleetwood v. Harford Systems Inc.</span>, 380 F. Supp.2d 688, 702 (D. Md. 2005) (an employer cannot escape liability for disability discrimination simply because the employee failed to suggest a particular accommodation). As the Board has repeatedly stated, an employing agency is in a better position than a disabled employee to know about its ability to modify duties or working conditions to meet the needs of the employee. <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 693 (1996); <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Department of Education</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 541, 544 (1992); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 148, 152 n.2 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With these principles in mind, we find that the appellant met his responsibilities. The appellant informed the agency on March 5, 2004, that the recurrence of pain and numbness in his hands prevented him from completing his work, and in response, the agency informed him that he would need to provide additional medical documentation from Dr. Scott. In addition, Debbi Creed, a Certified Industrial Hygienist with the agency, met with the appellant on March 10, 2004, to review his position. She prepared an Ergonomic Evaluation Report, dated March 12, 2004, which recommended that the appellant receive a wave-style (split) keyboard with a built-in touch-sensitive mouse and additional training to improve his keyboarding skills. On appeal, in a statement submitted under penalty of perjury, the appellant stated that Creed also suggested during their meeting that a voice-recognition program may be a reasonable accommodation for his condition. The agency did not submit a statement from Creed or any other evidence to refute the appellant's sworn statement on this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 15, 2004, Dr. Scott prepared a detailed statement of the appellant's restrictions. He reiterated previously recommended limitations of no more than 5 pounds lifting and avoidance of repetitive hand and arm movements. Dr. Scott also recommended that the appellant perform no more than 5 minutes of keyboarding at a time, followed by at least 15 minutes to rest his hands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 22, 2004, the agency decided that the appellant's keyboarding restrictions could not be reasonably accommodated in his modified Currency Controller position. Without consulting with the appellant or Dr. Scott, the agency determined that the appellant could not perform the essential functions of his position or any other vacant position, with or without an accommodation. After determining that no other vacant positions existed to which the appellant could be assigned, the agency proposed the appellant's removal on April 6, 2004, for inability to perform the duties of his current Currency Controller position and his prior Currency Exchanger position. It later removed him, leading to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the agency's argument, the record establishes that the appellant fully cooperated in the interactive process envisioned in 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630 App. &#x00A7; 1630.9 by promptly providing additional medical information on the nature of his disability, by indicating his interest in finding a reasonable accommodation, and by meeting with Creed, the agency's Industrial Hygienist. All indications are that the agency was on notice before it removed the appellant that he had difficulty performing keyboarding tasks and that he was interested in finding an accommodation. Further, the agency either expressly considered (through Industrial Hygienist Creed) or should have considered the obvious possibility that voice-recognition software might alleviate the appellant's difficulties. The agency, in essence, argues that the appellant sat silently by while it removed him and is now ambushing it with a claim of disability discrimination seeking the accommodation of voice-recognition software. The evidence does not support the agency's argument, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appeal must be remanded for further consideration of the appellant's disability discrimination claim.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found in his initial decision that the appellant had established a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" of discrimination because he "articulated" a reasonable accommodation by asserting that voice-recognition software would reduce the need to use his hands for data entry. The administrative judge emphasized that the appellant was "not required to prove" that installation of voice-recognition software was a reasonable accommodation in order to make out a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case." The administrative judge then found that the agency had failed "to show" that installation of voice-recognition software would pose an undue hardship. The administrative judge thus held that the agency committed disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's approach was not appropriate. The "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" inquiry is intended to guide an adjudicator who is assessing the sufficiency of a complaint and/or considering a motion for summary judgment. As far as the administrative judge was concerned, however, the record was complete and both parties had had an opportunity to submit evidence on the discrimination issue. At that stage in the proceedings, whether the appellant made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was immaterial, and the proper inquiry was whether the appellant proved, by preponderant evidence, that the agency committed discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 714-15 (1983); <span class="Italic">Simien v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-28 (2005); <span class="Italic">Schrodt v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disability discrimination case concerning denial of a reasonable accommodation, the appellant ultimately must prove that he is a qualified person with a disability, i.e., a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation. The appellant cannot prevail merely by "articulating" a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m);<span class="Italic"> Conaway v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 54 (1998).[3] To rule in favor of an employee on a disability discrimination claim merely because he has "articulated" a reasonable accommodation not only relieves the employee of his burden of proof, but it can lead to an unenforceable decision. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 52-54 (decision finding disability discrimination was not enforceable because in fact, after the evidence was weighed, it was clear that the accommodation "articulated" by the appellant was not feasible); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Henry v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14 (2005) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To the extent that <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 552, 561 (1997), suggests that an appellant can ultimately prevail on a disability discrimination claim by "articulating" an accommodation without proving by preponderant evidence that the requested accommodation is reasonable, we overrule it. As we noted above, when the record in an appeal is fully developed, a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case," burden-shifting analysis is inappropriate, and instead the inquiry is whether the appellant met his ultimate burden of proving discrimination by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 52-53.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the foregoing, we decline to resolve the appellant's disability discrimination claim at this stage. On this record, we are not left with any clear sense of whether voice-recognition software would or would not allow the appellant to perform the essential functions of his position. If, as might be the case, such software running on a dummy personal computer would act as the functional equivalent of a keyboard, it would not be at all surprising to learn that the software allowed the appellant to perform all of his duties. On the other hand, if introducing voice-recognition software into the agency's system required the agency to rewrite the code for what it claims is a proprietary system, or if, as the agency claims on review, voice-recognition software compromised the agency's security, then it might not be a reasonable accommodation. We simply do not know, because evidence is lacking from <span class="Italic">both</span> parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3439"></span>Whether voice-recognition software would be a reasonable accommodation for the appellant's condition is a fact-intensive inquiry. Resolving this issue requires clear findings on the following points, among others: Whether there is a voice-recognition program that is compatible with the appellant's speech patterns, <span class="Italic">see Miller v. Principi</span>, 2006 WL 2222682, *5 (W.D. Tenn. 2006) (claim of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act brought by a nurse with carpal tunnel syndrome failed because, among other things, the voice-recognition software that might otherwise have allowed her to enter data into a hospital computer system was incompatible with her speech patterns); whether such software is compatible with the agency's computer system, <span class="Italic">see Alek v. University of Chicago Hospitals</span>, 2002 WL 1332000, *7 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (proposed accommodation of voice recognition software for an individual's carpal tunnel syndrome was not compatible with the employer's computer system), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 54 Fed. Appx. 224 (7th Cir. 2002); whether the expected rate at which voice-recognition software would misinterpret the appellant's speech and introduce errors into the agency's currency tracking system is acceptable, as compared to the tolerated error rate from typing; and whether the appellant could perform his job with voice-recognition software as quickly as the agency expects someone in his position to perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that the agency committed disability discrimination when it failed to reasonably accommodate the appellant with voice-recognition software is not based on any probative evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Bass v. County of Butte</span>, 2004 WL 1925468, *4 (E.D. Cal. 2004) (the general statements of a vocational counselor concerning the use of voice recognition software were insufficient to generate a triable issue of fact on a disability discrimination claim brought by a police dispatcher whose carpal tunnel syndrome limited her ability to type; the employer was entitled to summary judgment). The initial decision, if allowed to stand, could lead to an enforcement proceeding in which the evidence showed that voice-recognition software is not a reasonable accommodation. We are loathe to create the possibility of a repeat of <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> and <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, where the appellants obtained final Board decisions finding disability discrimination, and later had their victories taken away from them on reopening when, after further evidence was presented, it became clear that the accommodations identified in the final Board decisions were not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the record closed below, the administrative judge merely informed the appellant that he "must show" that there was an accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his position or a funded vacant one to which he could be reassigned. The administrative judge's apparent belief that the appellant could prevail merely by "articulating" an accommodation may have led him to issue this terse order. However, the administrative judge should have gone into much more detail, and should have explained to <span class="Italic">both</span> parties how complex and fact-specific the inquiry in this particular case is. This is not a simple case involving, say, a lifting restriction--where an administrative judge might examine a position description and then use common knowledge to determine whether an asserted accommodation is reasonable--and it should not be treated as if it were a simple case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Narcum v. Department of the Interior</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 645 (2005) (appeal remanded for presentation of additional argument and evidence where the appellant attempted to claim disability discrimination and he was not put on specific notice of the elements of a failure-to-accommodate claim and his burden of proof).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gavette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 166, 179 (1990), allowed for the possibility that the requisite elements of proof might vary according to the particular facts and circumstances of a case. The appellant must present evidence making at least a "facial showing" that his disability can be accommodated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Maulding v. Sullivan</span>, 961 F.2d 694 (8th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's contention that the Board's decision in this case is contrary to law centers upon the Board's finding that the appellant had identified accommodations that "quite possibly would ameliorate the adverse effects" of his handicapping condition. 37 MSPR at 15. OPM contends that the effect of this finding is to require the agency to disprove that the accommodation might possibly allow the appellant to perform the duties of his position, thus placing upon the agency the ultimate burden of proving that the appellant was not a qualified handicapped employee, a burden that does not fall upon the agency by law and regulation. OPM also contends that the legal standard which the Board articulated in this case is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. United States Postal Service</span>, 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148 (1988). In this regard, OPM contends that the Board correctly stated the standard in <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet,</span> but incorrectly stated it in this case and in <span class="Italic">Savage.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of these decisions demonstrates that there is no inconsistency in the test which the Board applied in <span class="Italic">Lynch</span> and in other handicap discrimination cases. The Board has consistently required appellants to make a facial showing that their handicaps can be accommodated. The numerous Board decisions which have articulated and applied this standard span the past decade. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Stalkfleet,</span> 6 MSPR at 647; <span class="Italic">Savage,</span> 36 MSPR at 152; <span class="Italic">Cason v.

The Board has also consistently held that this facial showing need not include a complete list of all possible effective accommodations or proof that the suggested accommodations would without doubt allow the employee to perform his job. <span class="Italic">E.g., Savage,</span> 36 MSPR at 152 n.2; <span class="Italic">Ignacio v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service,</span> 35 MSPR 55, 63 (1987). The Board's holdings regarding the nature of the appellant's facial showing are consistent with EEOC and court decisions. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Pet. No. 03830052 (October 13, 1983), and <span class="Italic">Prewitt v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> set forth a detailed explanation of the appellant's burden of articulating a reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The extent to which an appellant is able to articulate a reasonable accommodation will vary depending on the issues and circumstances of the case. In general, however, the agency can be expected to know more than the appellant about the essential duties of the position or positions at issue, about its own ability to modify duties or working conditions, and about the availability of positions that could be filled by employees with certain limitations.... On the other hand, the appellant can be expected to know more than the agency about his qualifications and capabilities, and, as we have noted above, he bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in establishing his affirmative defense of handicap discrimination. Accordingly, although the agency has the ultimate burden of showing an inability to accommodate the appellant's handicap, <span class="Italic">the appellant "initially has the burden of</span> <span class="Italic">coming forward with evidence to make at least a facial showing that his handicap can be accommodated." Treadwell v.</span> <span class="Italic">Alexander,</span> 707 F.2d 473, 478 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Savage,</span> 36 MSPR at 152 n.2 (emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's contention that the Board articulated an erroneous subjective standard relies on a single phrase in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> which referred to the appellant's belief that his handicap could be accommodated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152. This argument, however, ignores the accompanying explanation, quoted above, which clearly dispels any suggestion that the Board was applying a subjective standard. A review of the Board's decisions since <span class="Italic">Savage</span> which have addressed claims of handicap discrimination supports this view. There is no indication in any of these decisions that the Board relied on an appellant's mere subjective belief that his or her handicap could be accommodated. Rather, consistent with the <span class="Italic">Treadwell</span> decision on which the Board relied in <span class="Italic">Savage,</span> the Board has required appellants to present evidence which makes at least a "facial showing" that their handicaps can be accommodated. <span class="Italic">E.g., Cason,</span> 37 MSPR at 267; <span class="Italic">Widger v. Veterans Administration,</span> 37 MSPR 368, 371 (1988); <span class="Italic">Clopton v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 373, 378 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 78-79 (1997), emphasized that a burden-shifting analysis is not used when there is direct evidence of disability discrimination in the form of a removal based on appellant's inability to perform her job as a result of depression:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who raises a claim of disability discrimination may establish that she is disabled by showing that she is substantially limited in a major life activity, that she has a record of such a limitation, or that she is regarded as having such a limitation<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, slip op. at 4-5. Here, the evidence showed that the appellant was not actually disabled as of the time of her removal but that she was erroneously "regarded as" disabled by the agency (since the agency removed her based on its unproven determination that she was disabled).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The "regarded as" category covers individuals who are not disabled but who, because of attitudes or for any other reason, are regarded as disabled by others who have an effect on the individual securing, retaining, or advancing in employment<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's charge of inability to work due to depression is directly related to the appellant's perceived disability. In addition, the agency's charge of AWOL is substantially related to the appellant's disability due to depression, and does not involve any independent acts of misconduct unrelated to those issues. Because the agency explicitly based its action on the appellant's alleged disability, thus presenting direct evidence of discrimination, and did not assert any independent, nondiscriminatory reason for the action, we find that the burden-shifting analytical framework is inappropriate<span class="Italic">.

The appellant showed that she was a qualified disabled person protected by the discrimination laws because, as discussed above with respect to the charges, the evidence showed that she was capable of performing her job duties without accommodation.

The court in <span class="Italic">Monette</span> noted that 42 USC &#x00A7; 12112(b)(6) provides that an employer discriminates within the meaning of the statute by "using qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability...unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity." <span class="Italic">Monette,</span> 90 F.3d at 1184. The court reasoned that "[A]lthough this section of the statute expressly concerns only qualification standards, testing procedures, and selection criteria that tend to screen out disabled individuals, we believe its clear import dictates that employers bear the burden of proving that a challenged job requirement is job-related." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the employee claiming disability discrimination must prove that he is a "qualified" disabled person, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and safety of himself or others. <span class="Italic">Fox v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 MSPR 522 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). Contrary to <span class="Italic">Monette,</span> other courts have held that it remains the plaintiff's duty, in establishing her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, to show that she was "otherwise qualified," which includes establishing the essential functions" of her job. <span class="Italic">See Laurin v. Providence Hosp.,</span> 150 F.3d 52, 58-59 (1st Cir. 1998) (since an ADA plaintiff ultimately must shoulder the burden of establishing that she was able to perform all "essential functions" of her position, she bore the burden of adducing competent evidence from which a rational factfinder could have found in her favor on the "essential function" inquiry); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. City of Hartford,</span> 959 F. Supp. 125, 131 n.6 (D. Conn. 1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Borkowski v. Valley Cent. School Dist.,</span> 63 F.3d 131, 137 (2d Cir. 1995)); <span class="Italic">cf. Benson v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</span> 62 F.3d 1108, 1113 (8th Cir. 1995) ("Because Northwest disputes Benson's evidence that he can perform the essential functions of the mechanic's job, it must put on some evidence of those essential functions."). Although bound to follow it, a district court criticized <span class="Italic">Monette on</span> this issue. <span class="Italic">See Hamlin v. Charter Township of Flint,</span> 942 F. Supp. 1129, 1137-38 (E.D. Mich. 1996) <span class="Italic">(Monette</span> "equates a statutory prohibition (i.e., no unlawful or pretextual screening mechanisms) with the creation of a legal burden," and "effectively turns on its head the burden of proof in an ADA case because rather than the plaintiff being required to show that he or she is capable of performing all of the essential functions of a job, all he or she need do is challenge the essentiality of one of the job functions, and, thereby, shift the burden of proof on one of the critical factors for showing that he or she is qualified for the job. Such a shift is clearly unwarranted because it allows a plaintiff to avoid making his or her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.") (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need, not resolve this issue because, as previously found, the appellant has demonstrated no legal error in the arbitrator's finding that she did not show that her impairment substantially limited a major life activity. Therefore, she has not shown that she was an individual with a disability, let alone a qualified individual with a disability. In any event, because there appears to be a split in the courts on the issue of who has the burden of proving the essential functions of a position, and the appellant has identified (and we have found) no Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) decision directly addressing this issue, the appellant has not demonstrated legal error by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency fails to meet the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination or, more particularly, if the agency fails to establish that it could not make reasonable accommodations to the appellant without imposing an undue hardship on its operations, the appealed action will be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGraw v. VA</span>, 7 MSPR 392, 395 (1981) (agency failed to rebut the appellant's assertions that his real duties differed from those of his position description, that duties requiring strenuous physical work were not routine, and that he could perform his regular administrative duties despite the rheumatoid arthritis condition that led to his removal for the alleged inability to perform the physical duties required of his position). Assuming the agency meets its burden, however, the appellant then has the opportunity to show that the agency's stated reason for failing to accommodate his disability is a pretext for the prohibited disability discrimination. If the AJ finds the appellant carried his burden of proof that the removal action was based on the prohibited personnel practice of disability discrimination in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(D), the action cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 55, 65-66 (1987); 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 52 MSPR 541 (1992), discounted the argument that the duty to accommodate a disability depends on the subjective feeling of the appellant that his disability can be accommodated. A disability discrimination defense is to be assessed on the basis of evidence, not speculation. The employee's belief that he is disabled is no substitute for evidence of a disability, <span class="Italic">Maulding v. Sullivan</span>, 961 F.2d 694, 699-700 (8th Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record and briefs show and the district court found that, in total, the plaintiff submitted statements of two doctors that she refrain from lab work, based on some work documentation, some clinical evidence, and a memorandum of her reported history of chemical exposure. Her clinical work showed that her X-rays were normal, and her pulmonary function studies did not require restrictions to her chemical exposure. Her doctors' letters contained statements that the plaintiff should refrain from working in the lab, based primarily on her own information, fears, and subjective concerns. Neither was supported by sufficient records, treatment plans, or other corroborating evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Smith concluded that the letters and other documentation were inadequate as a medical basis upon which he could conclude that there was a serious health risk involved in the assigned lab work. He had given the plaintiff a list of chemicals to which she would be exposed in the lab, and no doctor made specific findings that those certain chemicals would harm the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is regrettable that the agency, for whatever reasons, could find no basis to accommodate the wishes and concerns of this experienced employee....&#8197;We are sympathetic to her contention that her doctors did not know how to test her chemical aversions and that defendant was obdurate in insisting upon data available only from limited sources. These acknowledged concerns on our part do not overcome plaintiff's failure on this record to carry her burden of demonstrating handicap, disability or <span class="Italic">justified</span> health concerns that would preclude at least an effort to report for, and to attempt to perform, her assigned work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Medical evidence of disability should be specific, <span class="Italic">Vena v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 111 MSPR 165, 170 &#x00B6; 13, 2009 MSPB 64 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the arbitrator's analysis of this issue. Neither the testimonies of the appellant and Faheem Moghal, M.D., nor the medical evidence submitted into the record, a psychiatric evaluation from 1998 by Harold Ginzburg, M.D., and a letter from Dr. Moghal in May 2008, indicated that the appellant was substantially impaired in any major life activity by his bipolar disorder. Dr. Ginzburg and Dr. Moghal both opined that the appellant was legally disabled or handicapped. Their conclusory statements, however, are not sufficient to demonstrate that the appellant is legally disabled because they are not supported by medical evidence demonstrating that the appellant was substantially limited in a major life activity; on the contrary, both doctors expressed that the appellant's bipolar disorder was controllable and controlled, and that he was able to function normally and able to perform his work duties. Therefore, the appellant has shown no error in the arbitrator's finding that he failed to prove he was disabled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that the employee demonstrates that she is disabled and that the <span id="Page_3441"></span>disability can be accommodated, the bottom line is that the failure to make reasonable accommodation constitutes disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 665, 672-73 (1992) (finding no discrimination: the agency made placement attempts and appellant refused to wear a respirator); <span class="Italic">McQueen v. DOJ</span>, 53 MSPR 530, 533 (1992) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988)).
