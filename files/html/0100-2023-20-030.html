<p class="Body-Text">"One who is perceived as a whistleblower is entitled to the protections of the WPA, even if he has not actually made protected disclosures." <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 606, 617 &#x00B6; 16 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Schaeffer</span> overruled as to the determination that an IRA appeal would cover an alleged involuntary retirement, since the involuntary retirement is an appealable constructive action, <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. SSA,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COVARRUBIAS_JOANNA_SF_1221_09_0133_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_500317.pdf">113 MSPR 583</a>, 587 n.2, 2010 MSPB 90 (2010), <span class="Italic">Covarrubias in turn overruled by Colbert v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 677, 684 n.5, 2014 MSPB 80 (2014)). <span class="Italic">Demery v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2282.Opinion.4-9-2020_1566792.pdf">809 Fed. Appx. 892</a>, 898 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), explained the concept of a perceived whistleblower:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The perceived whistleblower doctrine prevents a supervisor from taking retaliatory action against an employee, even if the employee's disclosure is later found unprotected, so long as the retaliation was taken in response to the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 382 F. App'x 942, 947 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Thus, even if Ms. Demery did not actually engage in a protected activity, she could still have a claim if the agency officials nevertheless perceived her as having engaged in protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the perceived whistleblower, <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 165, 176-77 &#x00B6; 26-27, 2015 MSPB 2 (2015) (replacing <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 24, &#x00B6; 25-26, 2014 MSPB 85 (2014)), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under certain circumstances, an appellant can establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal without making a nonfrivolous allegation that she made a protected disclosure. Specifically, an individual who is perceived as a whistleblower is still entitled to the whistleblower protections, even if she has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 6 (2011); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 274, 278-80 (1990). For the following reasons, we find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction under this theory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there is no indication that the Chief or the Assistant Chief were aware of any specific disclosures that the appellant might have made during her August 29, 2012 meeting with the Director, the appellant alleged that they were very resistant to the notion that she should have such a meeting, even to the point of threatening to discipline her for it. She also claimed that, after the meeting, she was treated poorly, and the agency initiated discipline against her for which she was denied official time to respond. Absent from the appellant's allegations, however, is any indication that the opposition to her meeting with the Director was due to the Chief's and Assistant Chief's perception that she was going to make protected disclosures during that meeting or if it was due to some other reason. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8 (in cases involving perceived whistleblowing, the Board will focus its analysis on the agency's perceptions, i.e., whether the agency officials involved in the personnel actions at issue believed that the appellant made or intended to make disclosures that evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)). Regarding the actions taken after the meeting, the appellant alleged that "[n]egative comments were made about the disclosure by [the Assistant Chief]," and she was "advise[d] that [she] would be disciplined for failing to follow the chain of command." Once again, however, the appellant did not allege that the perception of her as a whistleblower, rather than her failure to follow the chain of command, was the reason for these comments or for the threatened discipline. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8. The appellant's assertion that the Assistant Chief made unspecified "negative comments" about her meeting with the Director is insufficient to remedy this defect. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 7 (2008) (conclusory, vague, or unsupported allegations are insufficient to qualify as nonfrivolous allegations of IRA jurisdiction). For these reasons, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency perceived her as a whistleblower, despite her having received explicit notice on this jurisdictional issue.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's letter was known to his managers, including the Associate Director of the VAMC, we also have considered whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was perceived as a whistleblower.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that a variety of fact patterns can support a finding that an individual was perceived as a whistleblower. In <span class="Italic">Mausser v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 41, 44 (1994), the appellant compiled a list of "waste, fraud, and abuse," "safety issues," and violations of "government regulations" that he observed at the agency, with the intention of disclosing the list to the Inspector General after he completed his probationary period. Although the appellant never actually disclosed the list and was therefore not a whistleblower when the agency terminated him, the Board found that the agency may have perceived him as a whistleblower to the extent that the agency knew about the list and his intention to disclose it. <span class="Italic">Mausser</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 44. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Administration</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 569, 581 (1991), the appellant disagreed with the agency Chairman's public position on the agency's financial condition, and he expressed his disagreement to various agency officials, including the Chairman himself. Although the appellant did not actually disclose his disagreement or the bases thereof to anyone outside the agency, and although he did not intend for the expression of his disagreement to constitute a whistleblowing disclosure, the Chairman still perceived the appellant as a whistleblower because he believed the appellant to be "a dangerous proponent of a view that could prove embarrassing--possibly evidencing mismanagement and abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Department of the Interior</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 435, &#x00B6; 15 (1999), a local newspaper reported that the appellant had disclosed "fraud, waste and abuse" at his employing agency but did not discuss the particulars of the disclosures. The appellant alleged that his supervisor was aware of the newspaper article and took personnel actions against him because of it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the Board found in that case that even absent a showing that the appellant made any protected disclosures, he made a nonfrivolous allegation that his supervisor perceived him as a whistleblower because the supervisor was aware of the newspaper article labeling him as such. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the cases discussed above arose from widely different factual circumstances, they share a common element, i.e., that agency officials appeared to believe that the appellants engaged or intended to engage in whistleblowing activity. Thus, the analysis of whether an appellant was actually a whistleblower is different from the analysis of whether an appellant was perceived as a whistleblower. In cases falling under the former category, the Board will focus its analysis on the appellant's perceptions and the disclosures themselves, i.e., whether he reasonably believed that his disclosures evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Parikh v.

In cases falling under the latter category, the Board will focus its analysis on the agency's perceptions, i.e., whether the agency officials involved in the personnel actions at issue believed that the appellant made or intended to make disclosures that evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mausser</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 44; <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 581-82.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal alleging that the agency retaliated against an appellant based on its perception that he was a whistleblower, he must show that he exhausted his remedies before OSC, and make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency perceived him as a whistleblower, and that the agency's perception was a contributing factor in its decision to take or not take the personnel action at issue. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 6 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant stated in his OSC complaint that he was "called on the carpet" by the VAMC Assistant Director after he wrote the letter to the head of the agency. Under the circumstances where this allegedly being "called on the carpet" occurred before any alleged retaliatory action, we find that the appellant's OSC complaint contained an allegation that he was perceived as a whistleblower, and thus he exhausted his administrative remedies as to this allegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as noted above, the appellant's letter fails to characterize the situation as falling under any of the (b)(8) categories. Thus, the circumstances here are unlike those in <span class="Italic">Mausser</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 44, where the employee headed his list with a (b)(8) category "safety." Further, the appellant failed to allege that the VAMC Assistant Director identified that the appellant's letter related to any (b)(8) category. In fact, contrary to the assertion in the appellant's OSC complaint that he was "called on the carpet," he stated in his first response to the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction that the Assistant Director "did indicate that I was not in trouble for the letter." Therefore, the circumstances here are unlike those in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 584, where an agency official identified the employee's disagreement with agency action as possibly implicating a (b)(8) category. Additionally, there is no outside reference to the appellant that characterized the situations mentioned in his letter to the head of the agency as any (b)(8) category. So, the circumstances here are unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Holloway</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5, where a newspaper reported that the employee disclosed a (b)(8) category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that any agency officials involved believed that the appellant made or intended to make disclosures that evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mausser</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 44; <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 581-82.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) authorizes the Board to consider a request for corrective action where the appellant alleges that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) by taking or failing to take a personnel action based on its perception that he engaged in activity protected under that statute. As with a claim of reprisal for perceived whistleblowing, the Board will not inquire regarding whether the appellant actually engaged in the protected activity; rather, the issue of whether the agency perceived the appellant to have engaged in the protected activity will stand in for that portion of the analysis at both the jurisdictional and merits stage of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8 (describing the analysis to be applied in a claim of retaliation for perceived whistleblowing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal involving such a claim, the appellant must establish that he exhausted his remedies with OSC and make nonfrivolous allegations that the agency perceived him to have engaged in the protected activity and that its perception was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or not take the personnel action at issue. <span class="Italic">See Linder</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 6.[5] Once jurisdiction is established, the appellant may be entitled to corrective action if he shows by preponderant evidence that the agency's perception that he engaged in activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) was a contributing factor in the decision to take or not take the personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">see King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 9.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained its position concerning protection of individuals who are perceived to be whistleblowers in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 274, 278-80 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who does not engage in protected activity may nonetheless be covered by the WPA where a retaliatory personnel action is taken against him based on the belief that he had engaged in a protected activity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he legislative history of the WPA indicates that Congress intended that a primary purpose of the Act was to encourage whistleblowers. Failure to provide employees with the protections of the WPA where agency officials have taken personnel actions against those employees based on the belief that they had made protected disclosures would discourage other employees from making protected disclosures. Such a chilling effect would contravene the purpose of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In similar circumstances, the Board held that an agency official committed a prohibited personnel practice against a subordinate who had threatened, but not yet made, a disclosure to the Special Counsel. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, <span class="Italic">rev'd</span> <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">other</span> <span class="Italic">grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the Special <span id="Page_3677"></span>Counsel charged that Harvey had violated 5 USC 2302(b)(9) by denying an employee consideration for available positions and contriving a geographical reassignment because the employee had prepared, <span class="Italic">but not yet sent</span>, a letter to the Special Counsel and the White House in which he complained that he had been deprived of work due to his whistleblowing activities. The Board reasoned that to hold otherwise would frustrate the purpose of section 2302(b)(9) and "would have a chilling effect on employees' exercise of their appeal rights."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the same vein, the court in <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Union Bank of Arizona</span>, 12 FEP 527 (D. Ariz. 1976), extended anti-discrimination protection against retaliation under 42 USC 2000e-3(a) to an employee who was believed to have filed discrimination charges against her employer. The court found that failure to protect such employees would have a chilling effect on their colleagues....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional support for finding that the WPA applies to employees who are not whistleblowers but are treated as such may be found, by way of analogy, in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The protections provided in the provisions of both of these statutes are similar to those provided by the WPA. Therefore, they may provide guidance in applying the WPA to the present issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 15(a)(3) of the FLSA prohibits discharge or retaliation in any other manner against an employee.... In <span class="Italic">Brock v. Richardson</span>, 812 F.2d 121 (3d Cir. 1987), the court reasoned that "the discharge of an employee in the mistaken belief that the employee has engaged in protected activity creates the same atmosphere of intimidation as does the discharge of an employee who did in fact complain of FLSA violations."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee because of his associations with a union organization.... In applying this section...courts have looked to the intentions and actions of the employer and have held that the discharge of an employee who the employer mistakenly believed was a member of and solicitor for a union was a violation of section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co.</span>, 311 U.S. 584, 602 (1941); <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v.

Both statutes protect employees whose employers retaliate against them under the mistaken belief that they have made protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the protections provided in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) apply where a retaliatory personnel action is taken against an employee believed to have engaged in protected activity even though the employee may not have actually done so.</p>

Our review of the appellant's OSC complaint, the cover letter that accompanied his complaint, and his other correspondence to OSC, reveals no claim that the agency took action against him based on his status as a perceived whistleblower.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the administrative judge noted the appellant's allegation that Mr. Tennant retaliated against him because of his intent to report the alleged abuse of authority to higher-level agency officials after the end of his probationary period, but the administrative judge found that this contention did not entitle the appellant to the protection of the WPA. In a recent case, however, we addressed a situation in which a probationer compiled a list of prohibited personnel practices committed by an agency and intended to disclose the contents of the list to the Inspector General after he completed his probationary period. He was terminated during the probationary period, however, without having disclosed the list to any authority. We found that the fact that the appellant never disclosed the list to such authority did not preclude him from whistleblower protection if the deciding official was aware that the appellant intended to disclose the list and thus perceived him as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">See Mausser v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 41, 44 (1994). The facts of that case are similar to the facts alleged here by the appellant and suggest that, even if he had not made disclosures to his coworkers, he might be entitled to the protection of the WPA if he could show that Mr. Tennant perceived him as a whistleblower.

<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, in order to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant must prove that she exhausted her administrative remedies before OSC and make nonfrivolous allegations that (1) she engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). <span class="Italic">Yunus v.

Under certain circumstances, however, an appellant can establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal without making a nonfrivolous allegation that she made a protected disclosure. Specifically, an individual who is perceived as a whistleblower is still entitled to the protections of the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), even if she has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Jensen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that a variety of fact patterns can support a finding that an individual was perceived as a whistleblower. For example, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

In other words, the employee's perception as a whistleblower arose from a case of mistaken identity. In <span class="Italic">Mausser v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 41, 44 (1994), the appellant compiled a list of "waste, fraud, and abuse," "safety issues," and violations of "government regulations" that he observed at the agency, with the intention of disclosing the list to the Inspector General after he completed his probationary period. Although the appellant never actually disclosed the list and was therefore not a whistleblower when the agency terminated him, the Board found that the agency may have perceived the appellant as a whistleblower to the extent that the agency knew about the list and the appellant's intention to disclose it. <span class="Italic">Mausser</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 44. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v.

Although the appellant did not actually disclose his disagreement or the bases thereof to anyone outside the agency, and although he did not intend for the expression of his disagreement to constitute a whistleblowing disclosure, the Chairman still perceived the appellant as a whistleblower because he believed the appellant to be "a dangerous proponent of a view that could prove embarrassing--possibly evidencing mismanagement and abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 581-82. In <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Department of the Interior</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 435, &#x00B6; 15 (1999), a local newspaper reported that the appellant had disclosed "fraud, waste and abuse" at his employing agency but did not discuss the particulars of the disclosures. The appellant alleged that his supervisor was aware of the newspaper article and took personnel actions against him because of it. <span class="Italic">Holloway</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 435, &#x00B6; 15. Therefore, even in the absence of a showing that he actually made any protected disclosures, the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his supervisor perceived him as a whistleblower because the supervisor was aware of the newspaper article labeling him as such. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the cases discussed above arose from widely different factual circumstances, they share a common element, i.e., that agency officials appeared to believe that the appellants engaged or intended to engage in whistleblowing activity. Thus, the analysis of whether an appellant was actually a whistleblower is different than the analysis of whether an appellant was perceived as a whistleblower. In cases falling under the former category, the Board will focus its analysis on the appellant's perceptions and the disclosures themselves, i.e., whether the appellant reasonably believed that her disclosures evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18, 22-23 (2011); <span class="Italic">Rzucidlo v. Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2006). In cases falling under the latter category, the Board will focus its analysis on the agency's perceptions, i.e., whether the agency officials involved in the personnel actions at issue believed that the appellant made or intended to make disclosures that evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mausser</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 44; <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 581-82. In those cases, the issue of whether the appellant actually made protected disclosures is immaterial; the issue of whether the agency perceived the appellant as a whistleblower will essentially stand in for that portion of the Board's analysis in both the jurisdictional and merits stages of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issues in an IRA appeal where the appellant was alleged to have been perceived as a whistleblower will otherwise remain the same. In particular, the appellant must establish that she exhausted her remedies with OSC on the issue of whether the agency perceived her as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">Coufal v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 18 (2004). The appellant must also show that the agency's perception of her as a whistleblower was a contributing factor in its decision to take or not take the personnel action at issue, which she may do through the knowledge/timing test. <span class="Italic">See Rubendall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). If the appellant meets her burdens on the merits of the appeal, the agency may still prevail if it can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action at issue absent its perception of the appellant as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">Juffer</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we find that the appellant raised the issue of her perception as a whistleblower in her complaint to the Office of Special Counsel, thereby satisfying the statutory exhaustion requirement. We further find that the cancellations of the vacancy announcements and nonselection for appointment were personnel actions under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2010). However, we find that the appellant has not yet made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency perceived her as a whistleblower or that her perception as a whistleblower was a contributing factor to her nonselection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the appellant did not receive explicit notice of how to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal as a perceived whistleblower, and the defect was not corrected by the agency's submissions or by the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue); <span class="Italic">Mason v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). Although it is not necessary for an administrative judge to provide notice in every IRA appeal of how to establish jurisdiction as a perceived whistleblower, we find that administrative judge in this case should have afforded the appellant such notice in light of the appellant's particular allegations. <span class="Italic">Cf. Washington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 150, 153-54 (1997) (although the jurisdictional notice was adequate at the time it was issued, the administrative judge should have afforded the appellant further jurisdictional notice when the parties filed evidence and argument implicating further jurisdictional issues). On remand, the administrative judge shall notify the appellant of how to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal as a perceived whistleblower and afford her the opportunity to file evidence and argument on the issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A person could be perceived as a whistleblower who acted as a conduit of information to a person who made a protected disclosure, <span class="Italic">Mount v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20190829102">937 F.3d 37</a>, 41-44 (1st Cir. 2019), remanding for further Board consideration after determining Mr. Mount exhausted his OSC remedy before he initiated his IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant here, the WPA precludes an agency from engaging in "prohibited personnel practices" against a federal employee for that employee's involvement in certain whistleblowing activities. Specifically, under Section 2302(b)(8), covered agencies are barred from retaliating against a federal employee for disclosing what the employee reasonably believes evidences "(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Section 2302(b)(9)(B) prohibits a covered employer from taking or failing to take a personnel action against an employee for "testifying for or otherwise <span class="Italic">lawfully assisting</span> any individual in the exercise" of certain appeals, complaints, or grievances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B)(emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Viens-Koretko v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 160, 163 (M.S.P.B. 1992) (noting that "the appellant's act of testifying for another employee at an EEO hearing constitutes an activity that is specifically protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B)").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A "perceived assistance" claim differs from an "actual assistance" claim in that under the former, the employee must prove that the agency officials perceived the employee engaged in protected activity, rather than that the employee actually engaged in protected activity. <span class="Italic">See King v. Dep't of Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, 695-96 (2011). Moreover, the employee must prove that the agency's perception (not the employee's protected conduct) was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 696.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, even if Mount did not actually engage in a protected activity, he could still have a claim if agency officials nevertheless perceived him as having engaged in protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Juffer v. U.S. Info. Agency</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 81, 86 (1998) (observing that plaintiff's disclosure was insufficient to constitute "a true protected disclosure under the WPA[,]" but "[o]ne who is perceived as a whistleblower is still entitled to the protections of the WPA, even if she has not made protected disclosures"); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 274, 278 (1990) (examining the WPA's text and legislative history, and finding that "[A]n employee who does not <span id="Page_3679"></span>engage in protected activity may nonetheless be covered by the WPA where a retaliatory personnel action is taken against him based on the belief that he had engaged in protected activity").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To date, the MSPB has only adopted a perceived activity analysis in &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) and &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) cases, whereas Mount brings his claim under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Corthell</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 422 (finding that the MSPB is authorized to consider a perceived activity claim under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C)); <span class="Italic">King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. at 695 (considering a perceived activity claim under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and citing a number of perceived activity cases that "arose from widely different factual circumstances" but nevertheless "share a common element, i.e., that agency officials appeared to believe that the appellants engaged or intended to engage in whistleblowing activity"). In this case, the MSPB noted that its reasoning in prior cases "would appear equally applicable to Section 2302(b)(9)(B)," and it thus "presumed" that a perceived assistance claim under that section is cognizable. The parties do not contest this, so we likewise presume it to be correct for the limited purpose of resolving this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See McCardle v. EEOC</span>, SF-1221-17-0270-W-2 (NP 1/6/2023) ("Having determined that the appellant was protected from retaliation on the basis of the OIG complaint filed on his behalf, we must next evaluate whether the appellant has proven contributing factor.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RUMSEY_ELISSA_DC_1221_11_0466_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_923039.pdf">120 MSPR 259</a>, 265-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, <span class="blue">2013 MSPB 82</span> (2013), analyzed proof offered to demonstrate that an appellant was perceived as a whistleblower:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...One who is perceived as a whistleblower is entitled to the protection of the WPA, even if she has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 33; <span class="Italic">Juffer v. U.S. Information Agency</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 12 (1998). The Board has found that a variety of fact patterns can support a finding that an individual was perceived as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 7 (2011). Among those fact patterns is the "mistaken identity" theory, in which the relevant agency official thought the appellant made protected disclosures, but the appellant did not actually do so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 274, 280 (1990). The critical factor is whether the agency official believed that the appellant engaged in whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8. In "perceived as" cases, the focus is not on the appellant's perceptions or the disclosures themselves, but on the agency's perceptions, i.e., whether the agency officials involved in the personnel actions at issue believed that the appellant made disclosures. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, to establish that the agency retaliated against her based on its perception that she was a whistleblower, the appellant must show that she exhausted her remedies before OSC, that the agency perceived her as a whistleblower, and that the agency's perception was a contributing factor in its decision to take or not take the personnel action at issue. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 9. If the appellant meets her burden of proof, the agency may still prevail if it can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action at issue absent its perception of the appellant as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, someone from the agency leaked information about the agency staff's 2007 grant recommendations and rating scores to <span class="Italic">Youth Today</span>. In December 2007, <span class="Italic">Youth Today</span> published an article that referenced that data and that contained a list of the scores each applicant received. Flores was admittedly "quite upset" about the article, and a number of grant applicants contacted the agency to protest the rejection of their applications. The appellant was not the source of the leak.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that Flores believed she was the leaker and that, in retaliation, he removed her compliance duties and transferred those duties from the Policy Office to the State Relations and Assistance Division (SRAD) in January 2008. The appellant testified that she knows Flores believed her to be the source of the leak because he looked at her during a staff meeting and stated "I know the person who leaked the data...and I'm going to get the persons who did this." The administrative judge, however, credited Flores's testimony that he did not suspect anyone in particular and did not perceive the appellant to be a whistleblower. Flores's denial is corroborated by a contemporaneous memorandum dated December 19, 2007, from Flores to the IG in which he informed the IG where the leaked information had been stored and provided a list of people who had access to it; the appellant's name was not on the list.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review that evidence that she was known to be a strong critic of Flores's grant decisions along with statements from two staff members close to Flores that they thought that Flores suspected the appellant was the source of the leak is sufficient to show that Flores perceived her to be a whistleblower. However, she has not explained why the administrative judge's reasoning is incorrect or identified evidence that the administrative judge failed to consider; she merely repeats the same arguments that the administrative judge considered and rejected. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133 (1980) (before the Board will undertake a complete review of the record, the petitioning party must explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect and identify the specific evidence in the record which demonstrates the error), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). At best, the appellant's evidence shows that, from Flores's point of view, the appellant was one of a number of possible suspects, but it does not narrow the scope of Flores's suspicions to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge based her conclusion that the appellant failed to prove that Flores perceived her to be a whistleblower at least in part on her assessment of Flores's credibility and demeanor as a witness. The Board is required to give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations where, as here, they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on witness demeanor. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellant has not proffered a sufficiently sound reason to set aside the administrative judge's findings. <span class="Italic">See McCarthy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 45 (in a whistleblower reprisal case, the Board is required to apply appropriate deference to an administrative judge's credibility findings consistent with the principles contained in <span class="Italic">Haebe</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disclosures to coworkers furnish a basis for IRA jurisdiction if the employee makes nonfrivolous allegations that supervisors or managers heard of the disclosures and acted on them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sirgo v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 261, 266 (1995). An alleged report in a local newspaper of an employee's whistleblowing activities constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the employee was perceived as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 82 MSPR 435, 441 &#x00B6; 15 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCARTHY_ROBERT_JOHN_DA_1221_09_0725_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_628714.pdf">116 MSPR 594</a>, 614 &#x00B6; 33, 2011 MSPB 74 (2011), the appellant's status as a perceived whistleblower was derived from an agency official's knowledge of the appellant's past whistleblowing activities with prior federal agency-employers. The analysis did not focus on the reasonableness of the prior whistleblowing disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One who is perceived as a whistleblower is entitled to the protection of the WPA, even if he has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 11 n.3 (2007); <span class="Italic">Juffer v. U.S. Information Agency,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 12 (1998). Commissioner Ruth testified that he was responsible for hiring the appellant in January 2009, and that he decided to hire the appellant knowing that the appellant had previously filed whistleblower disclosures regarding his previous employer, the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, as stated above, in his July 28, 2009, email to Commissioner Ruth, the appellant "assert[ed his] rights as a protected whistleblower" on the grounds that he had "report[ed] allegations of fraud, waste and abuse...to the State Department [OIG], the FBI, and/or other appropriate entities." Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant was perceived as a whistleblower.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For an individual to be perceived as a whistleblower based on statements made by the employee, he must have made a nonfrivolous disclosure that would constitute whistleblowing. If he is admonished for making improper statements, the appellant is not a perceived whistleblower, albeit he may be perceived as engaging in inappropriate comments, <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. MSPB</span>, 382 Fed. Appx. 942, 947 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Montgomery is not a perceived whistleblower. The perceived whistleblower doctrine prevents a supervisor from taking retaliatory action against an employee, even if the employee's disclosure is later found unprotected, so long as the retaliation was taken in response to the disclosure. Here, Messrs. Burton and Kaufman concede knowledge of Ms. Montgomery's allegations, but neither concedes the legitimacy of her allegations. Messrs. Burton and Kaufman did not perceive Ms. Montgomery as a whistleblower; rather they perceived her allegations as frivolous at best and dishonest at worst. Because her allegations were frivolous, it would be unreasonable for OIG to perceive her as a whistleblower and retaliate against her. Accordingly, absent specific evidence that OIG retaliated against Ms. Montgomery for her frivolous allegations, the perceived whistleblower doctrine does not apply. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 639, 654-55 (1997) (holding that the alleged disclosure must at least be reasonable for the perceived whistleblower doctrine to apply).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis of "reasonableness" of a disclosure may be called into question when the respondent in an OSC disciplinary case defends on the basis that the perceived reprisal victim's disclosures were unprotected. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 654-54 (1997), a respondent to an OSC disciplinary case challenged the reasonable belief in disclosures contained in an anonymous letter that the respondent incorrectly attributed to his secretary. Because protection accrues to individuals who are mistakenly believed to be whistleblowers and suffer reprisal for their perceived status, the question became whether it should be necessary to assess the reasonableness of belief in disclosures of the putative whistleblower. The Board decided to engage in the speculative enterprise of determining the hypothetical reasonableness of the mistaken victim's disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e need not decide whether Pendleton was a contributor to the anonymous letter because we do not accept the parties' contention that, where the actual discloser is unknown, it cannot or need not be determined whether the disclosures could reasonably be believed to evidence matters protected under the statute. The language of section 2302(b)(8) makes plain that its protection extends only to reasonably based disclosures. Where the individual making the disclosure cannot <span id="Page_3680"></span>be determined, it is still possible, and necessary, to determine whether a hypothetical observer could reasonably believe that the information is evidence of agency wrongdoing covered by the statute. Absent such a reasonable belief, the statute does not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases on which OSC relies to support its contention that a determination of reasonable belief need not be made do not support its position. <span class="Italic">Mausser v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 41, 44 (1994), for example, held that in the absence of a disclosure an official's belief that an employee intends to make a protected disclosure may support a finding of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Mausser</span> did not hold that the anticipated disclosure need not be one which could reasonably be believed to evidence a violation. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 19, 23 (1995), the employee was mistakenly believed to have disclosed to Congress the inappropriate dumping of hazardous chemicals, and there was no question that the matter disclosed was one covered by the statute. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Administration</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 581-82 (1991), found that the discloser reasonably believed in the accuracy of his account of the agency's financial situation and that the retaliating official believed that the disclosure was one which might evidence mismanagement and abuse of discretion. It is implicit in the <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> decision that the official's belief was a reasonable one. None of these decisions can be read to hold that the coverage of section 2302(b)(8) is broader in cases where the disclosure is anonymous. Accordingly, we must determine whether the anonymous letter at issue here disclosed matters to which the statute applies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If in an IRA case the Board is to consider the assertion that the appellant was the victim of reprisal as a perceived whistleblower, that allegation should first be presented to OSC, <span class="Italic">Mitskog v. MSPB</span>, 680 Fed. Appx. 1005, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mitskog also argues that the Board erred by failing to consider her status as a "perceived whistleblower" and that the nature of her disclosures--protected or not--are irrelevant under this doctrine. <span class="Italic">See Montgomery v.

Cir. 2010) ("The perceived whistleblower doctrine prevents a supervisor from taking retaliatory action against an employee, even if the employee's disclosure is later found unprotected, so long as the retaliation was taken in response to the disclosure."). But this theory was not mentioned in Mitskog's submission to OSC. The record of her OSC submission reflects only her statement to FEC officials that she had "federal whistleblower status." This unilateral assertion is insufficient to demonstrate that agency officials <span class="Italic">perceived</span> her to be a whistleblower.</p>
