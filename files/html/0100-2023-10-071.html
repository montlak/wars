<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-71"><span class="space">4.</span> Witness Control; Sequestration</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic"><span id="Page_1364"></span>Judges' Handbook</span> provides guidance, at Chapter 10, section 12, for treatment of witnesses once they are called to testify during the hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a. <span class="Italic">Witness Instruction</span>. Witnesses should be instructed to spell their full names on the record. The recording system and the need for oral, audible responses should also be explained. The AJ may provide the witnesses with written instructions explaining their role in the hearing. A sample of such written instructions is included at Appendix B of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b. <span class="Italic">Administering the Oath</span>. Each witness must be sworn in by the AJ or court reporter but because certain individuals may object to taking an oath based on religious grounds, before swearing in each witness the AJ should ask if he or she has an objection to taking an oath. The oath or affirmation may be worded: "Do you solemnly swear (or affirm) that the testimony you give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God (or so help you)"? If recalled, a witness need not be resworn, but should be reminded that he or she is still under oath or affirmation. The oath for an interpreter may be worded: "Do you solemnly swear (or affirm) that you will provide a true and accurate translation of the testimony given by this (these) witness(es) so help you God (or so help you)"? If the witness has objected to taking an oath, the AJ can have the witness affirm. If the witness objects to affirming, the AJ could have the witness state the following: "I understand that I must accurately state the facts. I agree to testify under penalty of perjury. I understand that if I testify falsely, I may be subject to criminal prosecution."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c. <span class="Italic">Order of Witnesses</span>. Generally, the parties determine the order in which witnesses will be called. The AJ may require the parties to identify the order of witnesses. The AJ may permit or direct a change in the order of presentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d. <span class="Italic">Cross-Examination</span>. Each witness is subject to cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">e. <span class="Italic">Witnesses' Representatives</span>. A witness is entitled to have a representative while testifying, but the representative of a nonparty witness has no right to examine the witness at the hearing or otherwise participate in the development of testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">f. <span class="Italic">Sequestration</span>. It is good practice to routinely sequester witnesses and to caution them not to discuss their testimony with other witnesses during the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(6). Experience has shown that many witnesses frequently ignore this instruction. Therefore, they should be reminded that failure to heed to this cautionary requirement could lead to sanctions against one or the other of the parties, if that party has participated in the discussion, or that it could cause prejudice to a party, especially where the witness discusses testimony with a person who will later provide testimony in the same or a related proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">g. <span class="Italic">Witness Fees</span>. Although witness fees are considered nonrecoverable costs and therefore are not reimbursable as a part of attorney fees, a non-Federal employee witness has the right to "the same fee and mileage allowances which are paid subpoenaed witnesses in the courts of the United States." The party requesting the witness's appearance must pay the fee and allowances pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1821(b). <span class="Italic">See In re Maisto</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 436, 439 (1985). The party must offer payment at the time the subpoena is served, or if the witness appears voluntarily, then at the time of the appearance. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.37(c). Absent such tender or payment, the Board has denied enforcement of a subpoena. <span class="Italic">Alejandro v. Department of Transportation</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 463, 464 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf. Swafford v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 130 (1986) (subpoena for a local deposition was not defective when the appellant was ordered to appear and did not claim that she did not appear because of the failure to proffer travel expenses). Federal employees "will be in official duty status and will not receive witness fees." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.37(a). This includes compensation for time spent traveling to and from hearings, time spent waiting to testify, and for the travel expenses incurred; compensation for time spent on a hearing could be ordered at an overtime rate if a witness appeared at the hearing during nonduty hours. <span class="Italic">See In re Douglas</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 389, 391 (1987). The Board's compliance and enforcement authority, however, is limited to final decisions issued under its appellate jurisdiction, and a nonparty seeking enforcement of a final Board order must file both a petition for enforcement and a motion to intervene under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(c). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a), (c). While the Board "apparently" lacks authority to address witness fees prior to a final decision, <span class="Italic">Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 197 (1997), it has waived its regulation and held that on remand, the AJ may consider the witness's claim that the agency denied him compensation for the time and expenses incurred in his participation as a nonparty witness at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Board has declined to interpret 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 as requiring agencies to allow appellants official time and resources to pursue their appeals in the absence of any agency regulation specifically providing such a right. <span class="Italic">White v. Social Security Administration</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 447, 466-67 (1997). While section 7521 relates to appeals of ALJs, nothing in the statutes or regulations applicable to appellate jurisdiction cases appears to change that result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another publication of the Board, the <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span>, provides other suggestions concerning the treatment and control of witnesses. Although the <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span> has been superseded by the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, it remains a valuable source of guidance and is still used for training and orientation. The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> states, at 19-20:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">g.&#x2003;Controlling Witnesses</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Excluding Witnesses from Hearing Room</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The AJ may exclude from the hearing any witness whose later testimony might be colored by the testimony of other witnesses, or any person whose presence might have a chilling effect on a testifying witness. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR Sec. 1201.41(b)(7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Witness Consulting With Attorney During Examination</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;Witnesses have the right to representation when testifying.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;The representative of a nonparty witness has no right to examine the witness or otherwise participate in the development of testimony. 5 CFR Sec. 1201.31. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">McGowan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 314 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;The AJ should notify the prospective witness of the right to counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(d)&#x2003;The witness may consult with his counsel before answering questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(e)&#x2003;Counsel may instruct his client (the witness) not to answer a question if the answer might be self-incriminating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">h.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pro Se</span> Appellant as Witness</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Appellant has a right to testify in his own behalf and is subject to cross-examination by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Appellant may also be called as an agency witness. <span class="Italic">O'Neil v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 12 MSPR 212 (1982); <span class="Italic">Presley v. VA</span>, 15 MSPR 559 (1982); <span class="Italic">Lateef v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 664 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">i.&#x2003;Excusing and Recalling Witnesses</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;After testifying, each witness is excused and cautioned not to discuss the testimony outside of the hearing room.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A witness recalled to give additional testimony shall be advised that he/she is still under oath.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Generally, the courts have held that matters such as reopening a case, recalling a witness or accepting rebuttal testimony are within the trial judge's discretion. <span class="Italic">United States v. Somers</span>, 496 F.2d 732 (3rd Cir. 1974) (judge's refusal to allow counsel to recall witness not improper where counsel could have elicited information on cross-examination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Suggested instructions to be given to witnesses are furnished at Appendix B of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">You have been requested to testify in an appeal hearing before Administrative Judge _______________ of the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a prospective witness, you must remain outside the hearing room until you are called to testify. When you are called, go to the witness chair and remain standing until you are sworn in by the Administrative Judge or court reporter. If you have religious convictions against giving testimony under oath, you will be permitted to affirm to the truthfulness of your testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">You will be asked questions first by the representative of the party who requested your appearance and then by the other representative. The Administrative Judge may have questions for you as well. Please answer the questions fully but do not volunteer information not asked for. If you do not understand a question, you may ask for clarification. If an objection is raised to a question, wait to answer until after the Administrative Judge has ruled on the objection. Please answer the questions verbally and do not respond by gestures, such as nodding. Speak up so that the other people present can hear your answers because the microphone is for recording your testimony, not for amplification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following your testimony, you will be excused unless one of the parties requests that you remain as a potential rebuttal witness. In that case, you will be advised to return to the witness waiting area. Whether or not you are designated a potential rebuttal witness, you must not discuss your testimony with the other witnesses in this appeal until after the hearing has concluded entirely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unless otherwise announced, the hearing is open to the public. If you are not requested to remain available as a rebuttal witness or are not obligated to return to your regular work, you may quietly observe the remainder of the hearing as a member of the public.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Broida and Wiley's <span class="Italic">Witness Preparation: A How-to-Testify Guide for Potential Witnesses in Administrative Hearings</span> (Dewey Publications, Inc. 2003) for more detailed instruction.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> touches on sequestration of witnesses--one procedure <span id="Page_1365"></span>used promote the integrity of testimony. The AJ excludes from the hearing room those witnesses who have not yet testified. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(7) (2022). Those banished retreat to a witness room until their presence is required in the hearing. Some AJs automatically call for sequestration; others wait for a request from one party or the other.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While in the (usually small) witness room, groups of sequestered witnesses from the two different camps can attempt to be civil. Speaking of time spent in a witness room waiting to testify, it is usually longer than anticipated. Witnesses should be told to bring some reading material and some refreshment. Counsel should remember to let them know when lengthy breaks are taken (or when the hearing is adjourned to another day).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Violation of the sequestration rule has not resulted in any reported reversals. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 39 MSPR 470, 480 (1989), the appellant contended that witnesses conferred after being warned not to do so. The Board concluded that the discussions <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, not warranting a finding of prejudice to the rights of the appellant or to his ability to defend himself. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Lee v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 11 (2022) (denying sanctions for agency's alleged violation of sequestration order; AJ affirmed as to determination that no violation occurred and as to denial to appellant of video surveillance records).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sequestration of some witnesses may be ill-advised: for expert testimony, it may be helpful to have the experts listen to one another so that the areas of conflict are narrowed and the need for repetitious testimony is reduced. <span class="Italic">Miller v. CPSC</span>, 21 MSPR 447, 450 (1984), commented on sequestration of an expert witness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends in her petition that the presiding official erred in excluding her expert witness from the hearing, except when called to testify, because she could not fully consult with him. The Board's regulations provide that the presiding official has the authority to exclude a witness. 5 CFR Section 1201.41. Further, he applied the same rule to the agency's witness in this case. On one occasion, the appellant interrupted the hearing to consult with her witness outside the hearing room. In addition, the witness testified at length at the hearing. We therefore find the appellant's argument in this regard to be without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are some exceptions to the sequestration rule, most notably the appellant, whose privilege it is to sit through the entire hearing and every witness who testifies. Other exceptions were noted in <span class="Italic">Behensky v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 690, 696 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]trict adherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence is not mandatory in administrative proceedings....&#8197;A perusal of the specific language of Rule 615 makes it clear, however, that even under a strict application of the rules of evidence, the exclusionary rule does not authorize the exclusion of a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of his case. <span class="Italic">In re United States</span>, 584 F.2d 666 (5th Cir. 1978). A review of the record in this case discloses that Mr. Miller's presence in the hearing room would have been appropriate under this exception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally...the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that the district court did not err when it permitted the government to use a postal inspector as its final witness after he had been permitted to remain in the courtroom to assist the prosecutor during the testimony of other witnesses. The court opined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the inspector's testimony which principally related to matters peculiarly within his personal knowledge. <span class="Italic">United States v. Nix</span>, 601 F.2d 214 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It was, therefore, appropriate for the presiding official, in order to assess the reliability of agency records, to determine that eyewitness testimony was required to further explain the process by which those records were created. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Miller, who was the agency's technical representative, remained in the hearing subsequent to a sequestration order at the initial hearing, the presiding official determined, over appellants' objections, that since Mr. Miller was in charge of the data collection center where the administrative paperwork was processed, he had firsthand knowledge of the entire recordkeeping process and that his testimony at the remand hearing was essential. The presiding official's decision to permit Mr. Miller to testify under these circumstances, despite his prior sequestration order, was not an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">United States v. Bobo</span>, 586 F.2d 355 (5th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">United States v. Johnston</span>, 578 F.2d 1352 (10th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant unsuccessfully asserted prejudice because witnesses apparently were sequestered, <span class="Italic">Mappilaparampil v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-0432-09-0435-I-2 (NP 6/10/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that many of the agency's witnesses "lied under oath and collaborated in a separate room under the leadership of Ms. Ayers" and he contends that all "parties involved" should have been in the "same room for the justice to be served." The appellant has not identified any evidence to support his assertion that the agency's witnesses lied in their testimony. Moreover, insofar as the appellant appears to assert that all witnesses should have remained in the hearing room for the duration of the hearing, the Board's regulations provide that the administrative judge has the authority to exclude witnesses from the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(7); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 447, 450 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Additionally, the Board's administrative <span class="Italic">judges' Handbook</span> provides that it is good practice to routinely sequester witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board Judges' Handbook</span>, ch. 10, &#x00A7; 12(f).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may be necessary to present the testimony of the technical advisor. That individual should be called first, out of turn if necessary. It will not do to call as a witness a person who has been sitting throughout the hearing as a technical advisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Behensky v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 690, 692 n.3 (1985). Counsel to a party may want to testify for that party. It was determined in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USDA</span>, 9 MSPR 536, 540 n.13 (1982), that the AJ properly disqualified as an agency representative an attorney who was going to testify. The disciplinary rules governing the conduct of attorneys preclude them from acting as both advocates and witnesses, except under very limited circumstances. [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-09-225.html#sec2-222">Representative as Witness</a>" in Chapter 2; Chapter 4 on "<a href="0100-2023-11-054.html#sec4-55">Recurrent Evidentiary Problems</a>" for Board guidance on the evidentiary value of representatives' statements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As they depart the witness stand, the AJ may request or direct witnesses to avoid discussing the case or their testimony with others, particularly with those who have not yet testified. If the AJ fails to provide the admonition, or the admonished witness then speaks freely to prohibited personnel, the appellant is obliged to make an objection to the AJ if the matter is to be preserved for a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daniels v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 272, 282 (1993) (Board would not consider for the first time in the PFR that during the hearing the AJ permitted witnesses whose testimony was concluded to sit with witnesses who had not yet testified; an objection was not preserved at the hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs may require that a single witness called by both parties be examined but once, <span class="Italic">Baracker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 70 MSPR 594, 605 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He merely correctly informed the appellant's former representative that it was Board practice that a witness is called to the stand to testify once regardless of whether he was requested by one or both parties to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Or an AJ may allow a witness called by both sides to be separately examined by each side. The matter should be worked out in the prehearing conference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ has wide discretion concerning witnesses, including the authority to exclude those not shown to offer relevant, material, and nonrepetitious evidence. <span class="Italic">Davidson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 22 MSPR 531, 535 (1984). The AJ's discretion encompasses rulings on the probative value of the proffered testimony of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 404 &#x00B6; 14 (1999). Each time the AJ sustains an objection, the AJ is controlling the testimony of the witness. Not only may the AJ sustain (or interpose) objections to the subject matter of a witness's testimony, the form of the testimony may be controlled as well. An AJ may require a witness to answer questions on direct examination in his own words rather than reading prepared material into the record. <span class="Italic">Landry v. DLA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 85-2240). Although the Board said it will not strictly apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidentiary errors by the AJ severely curtailed appellant's substantive right to a fair and impartial hearing. <span class="Italic">Lockner v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 14 MSPR 352, 354 (1983) (AJ repeatedly and improperly allowed the agency representative to ask leading questions, allowed critical agency witnesses to testify from previously prepared statements without any indication that they could not recollect events, and chastised appellant's counsel for raising objections that were properly made); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BORNINKHOF_SF075209008_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253363.pdf">5 MSPR 77</a>, 5 MSPB 150 (1981) (AJ improperly relied on witnesses who testified by reading from an investigatory record). The AJ may properly terminate irrelevant testimony of a witness. <span class="Italic">Riese v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 666, 672 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One problem that occasionally occurs is a recess during cross-examination or a recess immediately after direct examination and before cross-examination. May the witness speak to counsel during the recess concerning the substance of her testimony? For a short recess, the answer is that the witness should be cautioned not to discuss his testimony with counsel. The Supreme Court explained, in a criminal case, <span class="Italic">Perry v. Leeke</span>, 109 S. Ct. 594, 600-02 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hen a defendant becomes a witness, he has no constitutional right to consult with his lawyer while he is testifying. He has an absolute right to such consultation before he begins to testify, but neither he nor his lawyer has a right to have the testimony interrupted in order to give him the benefit of counsel's advice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reason for the rule is one that applies to all witnesses--not just defendants. It is a common practice for a judge to instruct a witness not to discuss his or her testimony with third parties until the trial is completed. Such nondiscussion orders are a corollary of the broader rule that witnesses may be sequestered to lessen the danger that their testimony will be influenced by hearing what other witnesses have to say, and to increase the likelihood that they will confine themselves to truthful statements based on their own recollections. The defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him immunizes him from such physical sequestration. Nevertheless, when he assumes the role of a witness, the rules that generally apply to other witnesses--rules that serve the truth-seeking function of the trial--are generally applicable to him as well. Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate for a trial judge to decide, after listening to the direct examination of any witness, <span id="Page_1366"></span>whether the defendant or a nondefendant, that cross-examination is more likely to elicit truthful responses if it goes forward without allowing the witness an opportunity to counsel with third parties, including his or her lawyer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, the truth-seeking function of the trial can be impeded in ways other than unethical "coaching." Cross-examination often depends for its effectiveness on the ability of counsel to punch holes in a witness' testimony at just the right time, in just the right way. Permitting a witness...to consult with counsel after direct examination but before cross-examination, grants the witness an opportunity to regroup and regain a poise and sense of strategy that the unaided witness would not possess. This is true even if we assume no deceit on the part of the witness; it is simply an empirical predicate of our system of adversary rather than inquisitorial justice that cross-examination of a witness who is uncounseled between direct examination and cross-examination is more likely to lead to the discovery of truth than is cross-examination of a witness who is given time to pause and consult with his attorney....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, just as a trial judge has the unquestioned power to refuse to declare a recess at the close of direct testimony--or at any other point in the examination of a witness--we think the judge must also have the power to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during a brief recess in which there is a virtual certainty that any conversation between the witness and the lawyer would relate to the ongoing testimony....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion does not mean that trial judges must forbid consultation between a defendant and his counsel during such brief recesses. As a matter of discretion in individual cases, or of practice for individual trial judges, or indeed, as a matter of law in some States, it may be appropriate to permit such consultation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perry</span> noted that the rule may be different for longer or overnight recesses.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Geders v. United States</span>, 425 U.S. 80, 96 S. Ct. 1330 (1976) (a judge abused his discretion in a criminal case by precluding the defendant and his counsel from conferring during an overnight recess when direct examination of the defendant concluded and cross examination was to commence in the morning; the decision includes a historical discussion of sequestration of witnesses, also known as the "rule on witnesses").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies are permitted to conduct their litigation before the Board without unrealistic constraints. One witness apparently testified in a manner at variance with the information earlier provided to the appellant. The agency representative interviewed the witness on the eve of the Board hearing. Rejecting a charge that there was error by the contact between the representative and the witness, an argument based on the premise that the witness was unduly influenced because he was subordinate to the agency's deciding official in the adverse action appeal, a court concluded that no statute or regulation prohibited the protested contact and, further, no harm was shown. The witness was subject to cross-examination at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 770 F.2d 1044, 1048 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
