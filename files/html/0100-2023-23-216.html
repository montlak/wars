<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-214"><span class="space">h.</span> Nondisclosure or Confidentiality Clause</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Many settlement agreements contain confidentiality clauses requiring both parties to avoid commenting on or disclosing the terms of the agreement or the events leading to the settlement. The confidentiality clause may be tied to or independent of another provision restricting the information the agency releases to others, including prospective employers, about the appellant. Agencies typically insert into the agreements an exception to the clause allowing disclosure to those with a "need to know." Appellants may include exceptions for disclosure to spouse or family, lawyer or accountant, state, federal, and local tax authorities, as well as disclosures required in employment-related background or security questionnaires or investigations. Appellants may also insist on a provision that permits them to advise others that the case has "been settled." An implied exception to a confidentiality clause is for the Board to have access to a settlement that in an enforcement proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 85 MSPR 171, 174 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (reference by an agency representative to provisions of a settlement in the PFR did not violate the confidentiality provision "since the Board was already privy to the contents of the agreement"). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-23-215.html#sec16-213">'Clean Record' or 'Clean Paper'; Expungement or Withdrawal of Record; Implicit Requirement; NDAA; Executive Order 13,839; Executive Order 14,003</a>," for required documentation of Official Personnel File; to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-066.html#sec13-63">Nondisclosure Agreement; Gag Order; 5 USC 2302(b)(13)</a>," for limiting provisions statutorily required in nondisclosure agreements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is protective of nondisclosure agreements. An agency may not defeat the nondisclosure provision by arguing that the nondisclosure was immaterial. <span class="Italic">Markey v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 110 MSPR 196, 202 &#x00B6; 12, 2008 MSPB 238 (2008) (overruled in part, <span class="Italic">Shirley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 120 MSPR 195, 206 n.6, 2013 MSPB 76 (2013)), pointed out:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contests the administrative judge's recommendation by arguing that "even if the agency was in breach,...the breach was not material." "A party's breach of an agreement is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract." <span class="Italic">Caston</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 17. The Board has found repeatedly that an agency's violation of a settlement agreement's non-disclosure clause <span id="Page_5119"></span>constitutes a material breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Poett</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 16 ("[t]he non-disclosure clause is part of the consideration for which the appellant bargained."); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Commerce</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2005) (same); <span class="Italic">Diehl v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 620, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) ("[t]he Board has consistently viewed the violation of nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements seriously."). Here, the non-disclosure provision was a "major benefit to [the appellant] who, in exchange, agree[d] to withdraw [her] appeal[ ]." <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 11. "Condoning such [a] violation[ ] would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals." <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 620, &#x00B6; 8.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that a material breach is a breach which relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 69 MSPR 59, 62 (1995) (citing 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1104 (1964)). With regard to the breach of the nondisclosure provision, we note that the Board has consistently viewed the violation of nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements seriously. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mullins</span> <span class="Italic">v.

Condoning such violations would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals. <span class="Italic">Sena</span>, 66 MSPR at 466. Although the fact that a supervisor tells his wife about a term of an agreement seems relatively harmless, here, the wife was an employee at the same postal facility as the appellant. Since, under the terms of the agreement, the appellant was reinstated to his supervisor position at that facility, the breach defeated the obvious purpose of the provision in question--preventing other employees from gaining knowledge of the agreement's terms. Accordingly, we find that the agency's breach of the confidentiality provision concerned a matter that was of vital importance to the agreement, and was therefore material. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 465-66 (an agency's improper divulging of information to its employees in violation of a provision in a settlement agreement is a material breach).</p>

USPS</span>, 117 MSPR 211, 217-18 &#x00B6; 17, 2012 MSPB 2 (2012), involving an agency's noncompliance with a provision of an agreement setting the conditions for a medical examination of the appellant, noted as to the improper disclosure by the agency of information to the medical provider conducting the examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases involving disclosures of information in violation of a settlement agreement, the Board has consistently held that an appellant need not show actual harm, such as a failure to obtain a position or other form of monetary loss, in order to establish that a nondisclosure provision has been materially breached. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6; 10 (2011); <span class="Italic">Allison v.

In this case, as acknowledged by the agency, the independence of the medical examination is of vital importance to the agreement. We therefore find that the agency's release of medical records concerning the appellant to the examining psychiatrist, by itself, constitutes a material breach of the agreement. We will not require the appellant to prove actual harm, i.e., to also prove that her examining psychiatrist actually considered, read or reviewed the offending records he admittedly received from the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement contains a strict nondisclosure provision, it will be enforced, to the point of allowing the agreement to be rescinded for a material breach of the term, despite agency contentions that the disclosure of the agreement was either necessary or logical, <span class="Italic">Sena v. DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 458, 464-66 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law. <span class="Italic">Dati v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 397, 400 (1989). In construing the terms of the agreement, the words of the agreement are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time that they contracted, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and the Board may not modify those terms through its decision. <span class="Italic">Colonel v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 285, 291 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 743 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). The settlement agreement is quite specific as to permissible dissemination within the agency: "Agency further agrees that any dissemination or review of this Agreement within Agency shall be limited to the undersigned Agency legal representatives, civilian personnel and Dr. John Wiles." The sole signatory to the settlement agreement for the agency was Randall Kehl, Acting General Counsel. Accordingly, the dissemination of the agreement to the Office of Complaint Investigations in Dayton, Ohio, and to the EEO Counseling Office at Kirtland, would be consistent with the settlement agreement only if these offices are part of "civilian personnel."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the words "civilian personnel" are not capitalized, the apparent reference is to the agency's Civilian Personnel Office. We note that both the initial appeal file and the agency's affidavits on review contain a number of references to the Civilian Personnel Offices at Kirtland and in Washington, D.C. The agency has presented no evidence that either OCI or the Kirtland EEO Office is a part of or under the administrative control of the Civilian Personnel Office. It instead contends that nothing in the agreement contemplated a limitation on disclosure where enforcement and execution of its terms are in question, and that the disclosures to OCI and the Kirtland EEO Office were necessary to such enforcement and execution. The agreement contains no general exception for disclosures related to enforcement or execution, however; the only exceptions are for disclosures to the legal representatives in the adverse action appeal, to Dr. John Wiles, and to "civilian personnel."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the term "civilian personnel" could be construed to mean all personnel necessary to enforcement and execution of the agreement, the agency has failed to establish that dissemination of the settlement agreement to OCI or the Kirtland EEO Office was necessary to enforce <span id="Page_5120"></span>or execute the agreement. In his affidavit, Dr. Solberg stated that OCI has a longstanding policy requiring written verification that a complaint has been resolved before it can close out an EEO complaint. Written verification would not have required a copy of the settlement agreement itself, however. A written statement that the EEO complaint had been settled to the parties' mutual satisfaction, and that, pursuant to the settlement, the appellant was withdrawing that complaint with prejudice, would have both met OCI's needs and complied with paragraph (7) of the agreement. Such a statement, whether supplied by the agency's representative in the adverse action appeal, by the appellant, or both, would similarly have enabled the Kirtland EEO office to close out its files.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the agency breached the terms of the agreement regarding confidentiality. We next consider whether this breach was a material one justifying rescission of the settlement agreement. A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1104 (1964).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated in her affidavit that the confidentiality of the terms of the agreement was extremely important to her because of her concern that friends and coworkers would lose their esteem for her if they learned of the allegations of misconduct against her. She said she would agree to resign from her position only if the terms of the agreement were kept strictly confidential, and that she spent almost an entire day discussing the confidentiality of the settlement with the agency representatives and her attorney. She said she was upset that Ms. Spencer had seen the agreement because Ms. Spencer is a personal friend of hers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has viewed the violation of nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements seriously, because condoning such violations would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals by providing appellants with clean records and neutral or positive employment references. <span class="Italic">See Del Balzo v.

We further note that, because the breach of a nondisclosure provision cannot be fully cured, limiting an appellant's remedy to "enforcement" in such a case would be of limited usefulness. Accordingly, we find that the confidentiality provisions were vital elements parts of the settlement agreement that went to its essence, and that the agency's breach of the settlement agreement was a material one justifying rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Barnett v. USDA</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 908, 910-11 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (breach of confidentiality clause of agreement calling for the appellant's resignation was not a material breach because limited disclosure of agreement did not impair its principal purpose--allowing the appellant to apply for other employment with a clean record).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement calling for substitution of a resignation for a removal, coupled with a confidentiality clause, left the agency in breach of the agreement when, after the appellant applied for another agency position, the agency supplied information concerning the removal to OPM through an objection to placement of the appellant on the list of eligibles for the position he sought, <span class="Italic">Munoz v. SSA</span>, 97 Fed. Appx. 910, 912-14 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provided that Mr. Munoz would resign, that the record would show voluntary departure rather than removal for cause, and that the settlement and its negotiations would be kept in confidence but for the specified exceptions. The SSA argues that its obligation was met when it replaced the SF-50 that showed removal for cause with the SF-50 showing voluntary resignation. The SSA states that its disclosure of the removal, the reasons therefor, the appeal, and its settlement, did not violate the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA points to an earlier draft of the agreement, which specified how the agency would respond to inquiries:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">D.&#x2003;The Agency will respond to any inquiries from prospective employers regarding the Employee's tenure with the Agency. In response to any inquiry, the Agency will disclose verbally only the dates of the Employee's employment with the Agency, his position titles, grades, and salaries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA argues that since this clause was not included in the final agreement, it was not intended that the agency would be limited in its disclosures concerning the employee. However, as a matter of contract interpretation, an omitted draft clause cannot contradict an included final clause. We also take note that the omitted clause relates only to "verbal" disclosure. In contrast, the contractual provision of confidentiality of "all matters discussed during the settlement negotiations" as well as of the agreement itself, reasonably interpreted, includes the matter of Mr. Munoz's removal and its settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement states that the notice of removal for asserted performance inadequacies would be withdrawn. Withdrawal of a notice, and replacement with a different notice, is as if the original notice was not given<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Conant v. OPM,</span> 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("By agreeing to 'rescind' the SF-50, the IRS promised in effect to destroy it, erasing 'removal' and all reasons for such a removal from Ms. Conant's professional record with the agency."). The SSA's agreement to replace the Notice of Removal and not to disclose the agreement and anything discussed during the settlement negotiations leaves no room for the SSA's disclosure of the removal and the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA does not dispute that it disclosed this information in order to exclude Mr. Munoz from a similar position with the SSA. However, the SSA argues that these disclosures did not breach the confidentiality provisions because the agreement authorizes disclosure of "the agreement" to "officials who have a need to know to perform their official duties...." The SSA states that OPM had a "need to know" of Mr. Munoz's inadequate performance in order to perform its duty of selecting candidates for employment. Mr. Munoz states that the "need to know" provision related only to such limited need to know as was necessary to carry out the terms of the settlement agreement. He points out that this clause, as originally drafted, authorized disclosure of "the terms of the agreement," while the final clause authorized only disclosure of "the agreement," showing that disclosure was understood to be limited. He points out that only the agreement, and not his performance, is authorized to be disclosed. He also points out that the adequacy of his performance was never adjudicated, and thus that it was incorrect to criticize his performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge ruled that the agreement did not preclude the SSA "from advising OPM of its experience with his past performance," and held that the agreement was not breached by any of the agency's disclosures to OPM. On Mr. Munoz's appeal to the full Board, the two members who then constituted the Board (the third position was vacant) split on the disposition, leaving the AJ's decision as final. Board Member Slavet, writing separately in dissent from the AJ's ruling, presented the view that the agency was not precluded from describing Mr. Munoz's inadequate performance in critical elements that were common to his past position and the one for which he was applying, but that the agency exceeded this limited ability. She stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To the extent that the agency wanted to rely on the appellant's prior performance in the Benefit Authorizer Trainee position as the basis for its objection to the appellant's inclusion on the certificate of eligibles for the Social Insurance Specialist position, the agency could have provided other evidence to establish that the appellant's performance under particular critical elements of his prior position was deficient. For example, the agency could have submitted statements from the appellant's former supervisors and/or copies of the appellant's position description and performance improvement plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Member Slavet concluded that the removal and the settlement were required to be kept in confidence, and that their disclosure to OPM was a material breach of the agreement. Member Slavet found that the SSA did not show that OPM had a need to know about the rescinded removal and the settlement terms in order to rule on the SSA's objection to Mr. Munoz's qualifications. Member Slavet concluded that the conditions of confidentiality were material to the agreement and that their violation was a material breach, citing <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 206 &#x00B6; 10 (1998) ("The Board has viewed the violation of nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements seriously, because condoning such violations would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals by providing appellants with clean records and neutral or positive employment references."). We agree with Member Slavet, *914 and conclude that the SSA exceeded the permissible scope of disclosure as set forth in the parties' agreement. The SSA has not shown that OPM had a need to know about the removal and settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA presents the alternative argument that even if its actions did constitute a breach of the agreement, the breach was not material. Mr. Munoz responds that the breach went to the essence of the agreement, for the disclosure precluded consideration of his application for employment. Clearly the breach was material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA's disclosures breached the obligations set forth in the settlement agreement. We reverse the Board's decision, and remand for determination of an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agreement's confidentiality clause was violated when the agency disclosed events leading to a settlement during an EEO proceeding involving a subsequent employer of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 98 MSPR 398, 403-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2005), noted as to the agency's argument that the appellant was not adversely affected by what the agency characterized as an inadvertent disclosure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency underestimates the adverse effect of its disclosure. The purpose of the nondisclosure provision was not only to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the agreement, but also to prevent the disclosure of "the incidents leading up to" the appellant's appeal to the Board and the agreement. In other words, what the appellant bargained for and received under the agreement was a "clean slate" so that the "incidents" would not affect the future of her career. The FHFB's proffer of Mr. Levitt as a witness indicated that it accepted as credible the negative <span id="Page_5121"></span>statements that he made concerning the appellant. To assert, as the agency has, that such statements had no adverse effect is to ignore the damage done to the appellant's reputation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mullins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206 &#x00B6; 11 (1998) (while the disclosure of the appellant's personnel records reflecting disciplinary action did not result in monetary loss to the appellant, it was clearly an undesirable thing for his current employer to know). Moreover, the appellant is not protected against further disclosures by the FHFB, a nonparty to the agreement. The agency has taken away the clean slate that was the appellant's bargain, and its breach cannot be cured. <span class="Italic">See Mullins</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 211 &#x00B6; 9 (because information had already been divulged, the breach could not be fully cured); <span class="Italic">Vallad</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 533 (breach of nondisclosure provision cannot be fully cured). Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency's breach was a material one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that if one party breaches a settlement agreement, the nonbreaching party has the option of enforcing the terms of the agreement or rescinding the agreement and going forward with the original claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Betterly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 63, 66 (1991). Nevertheless, the Board has recognized that in some instances, the only available option to the nonbreaching party is rescission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. at 627 &#x00B6; 14 (where the agency breached a nondisclosure provision, an order of enforcement would not be an effective remedy). The appellant has clearly stated her desire to have her original appeal reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the initial decision dismissing the appeal pursuant to the settlement agreement is VACATED and the case is FORWARDED to the Washington Regional Office for reinstatement of the appeal. The appellant is ORDERED to reimburse the agency for any payments she received in connection with the settlement agreement. In the event that immediate reimbursement does not occur, the Board has the authority to enforce compliance at the conclusion of Board proceedings on the appeal. <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 124, 128 (1994),<span class="Italic"> overruled on other grounds by Wisdom v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 652, 656 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nondisclosure clause was interpreted to avoid finding an agency in violation of the agreement when information about the appellant was provided from one unit of the agency to another unit of the same agency. An agency cannot disclose something already known within the agency, <span class="Italic">Shirley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 120 MSPR 195, 204-06 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-28, 2013 MSPB 76 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In paragraph 6 of the settlement agreement, the "Parties" agreed that "the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the identity of the Parties, and the facts surrounding the agreement...are not to be disclosed to anyone," with the exception of certain permissible disclosures. The permissible disclosures are limited to the following: "disclosure of the contents of the Agreement when required by law; disclosures made by the Appellant to his immediate family members; and disclosures made by the Parties for the limited purpose of implementing or enforcing the terms of this Agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant contends the agency revealed "facts surrounding the agreement" when the Commission Office informed GAAR that his commission had been suspended, and this communication did not fall within the listed exceptions.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Regardless of whether the suspension of the appellant's commission constitutes a fact surrounding the agreement, or whether the Commission Office was required by law to report the matter to GAAR, the record reflects that Martin informed Pergiel of the existence of the appellant's underlying Board appeal. The existence of the Board appeal is a fact surrounding the agreement that resolved that same appeal, and it does not appear that Martin's communication was required by law or was necessary for purposes of implementing or enforcing the agreement. For the reasons discussed below, however, we find that Martin's communication is not within the scope of the nondisclosure clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant observes that paragraph 6 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of facts surrounding the agreement to "anyone," a term which read in isolation could be understood to include officials at GAAR. However, a settlement agreement must be interpreted as a whole. <span class="Italic">Coker v. Department of Commerce</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 523, &#x00B6; 8, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 355 Fed. Appx. 421 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The agreement states that it was entered into by the appellant and the "National Park Service." Thus, "[t]he Parties" to which the nondisclosure clause refers are the appellant and NPS, not CUGA or any other component of the agency. As the term "disclosure" is ordinarily understood, a party cannot disclose information to itself, because any information the party could disclose is already in its possession. <span class="Italic">See</span> Black's Law Dictionary 477 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "disclosure" as "[t]he act or process of making known something that was previously unknown; a revelation of facts"). Absent clear indications to the contrary, we must infer that when "[t]he Parties" agreed that information about the agreement would not be disclosed to anyone, they committed themselves not to reveal such information to third parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that the agreement does not preclude the appellant from seeking future employment with NPS. However, it does not follow that the CUGA officials involved in the settlement negotiations, who were aware of the suspension of the appellant's law enforcement commission and the reasons for the suspension, would have no concern about the appellant's potential employment as an NPS law enforcement officer in another part of the country. Indeed, it would have been extraordinary for these officials to commit NPS to hiding the appellant's impairment from managers of other parks within the same agency. Such a peculiar obligation would require clear language imposing it, which is not present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant wished for the agreement to prohibit individuals or offices within NPS from sharing information concerning the agreement, he could have bargained for a provision specifically prohibiting such communications. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sena v. Department of Defense</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 458 (1995), the parties entered a settlement agreement which provided that "any dissemination or review of this Agreement within Agency shall be limited to the undersigned Agency legal representatives, civilian personnel, and [an agency official identified by name]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 462. The Board held that the agency breached this provision when it disseminated the agreement to the agency's own Office of Complaint Investigations and Equal Employment Opportunity Counseling Office, which it found to be outside the scope of "civilian personnel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 464-65. In the present case, by contrast, the nondisclosure provision does not specify that information about the settlement agreement be confined to any particular part of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nondisclosure clause also stands in contrast to paragraph 3 of agreement, which identifies the specific agency official to whom the appellant was to submit his resignation, and provides that "CUGA and its staff" will not have access to the appellant's OPF. Similarly, paragraph 5 spells out the obligations of "CUGA personnel" should they receive an inquiry about the appellant from a prospective employer, and names the specific official to whom such inquiries are to be referred. These provisions demonstrate that when the parties intended for a clause to apply to a specific agency official or component, they knew how to make the agreement reflect their intentions. The nondisclosure provision does not differentiate between NPS and any component or individual within the agency, and thus cannot be read to intra-agency communications such as the ones at issue here.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Markey v. Department of Transportation</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 196 (2008), the Board considered a similar non-disclosure provision, in which "[t]he parties agree[d] that this settlement shall be kept confidential, and that this agreement's terms will not be disclosed by either party, except to the MSPB or to other government officials responsible for implementing the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. The Board found that the agency breached this provision by revealing the existence and terms of the agreement to an agency equal employment opportunity (EEO) investigator. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. Notably, however, the settlement agreement also provided that "nothing herein shall prevent Appellant from pursuing [his pending] EEO complaint," <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6; 8, so the agency's disclosure of the agreement to the EEO investigator could have been viewed as interference with the EEO process in derogation of the bargain it made with the appellant. In any case, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Markey</span> is inconsistent with the principle that a non-disclosure clause ordinarily does not prohibit communications within the agency that was a party to the agreement, <span class="Italic">Markey</span> is hereby overruled.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree with the administrative judge that the LCA's confidentiality provision would not be breached by its disclosure to the personnel necessary for its enforcement and execution.

If a term is ambiguous, parole [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] evidence is admissible to show the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn first to the term in question. It calls for the destruction of "all correspondence relating to this case." In interpreting this term, the administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although the term "correspondence" usually refers to "written communications," <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, 311 (5th Ed. 1979), it is not unreasonable to assume that the parties were referring to the records in this case, by the reference to "both military and civilian."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency objects to the administrative judge's assumption and argues that "correspondence," as defined in <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, is limited to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Interchange of written communications. The letters written by a person and the answers written by the one to whom they are addressed. The agreement of things with one another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that police investigative reports, which are kept in investigative files such as appellant's SSF, are not interchanges of communication, but are documented evidence of misconduct kept in investigative files. The agency contrasts the definition of "correspondence" with the definition of "document," also from <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> (5th Ed. 1979), at 432:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An instrument on which is recorded, by means of letters, figures, or marks, the original, official, or legal form of something, which may be evidentially used. In this sense the term "document" applies to writings; to words printed, lithographe[d], or photographed; to maps or plans; to seals, plates, or even stones on which inscriptions are cut or engraved....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency correctly notes, while all "correspondence" can be considered "documents," not all "documents" are "correspondence." According to the regulation submitted by the agency, Air Force Regulation (AFR) 205-32, an SSF must contain copies of documentation relating to the processing of an SSF in the file, including investigative reports, copies of administrative or disciplinary actions taken, and correspondence or forms relating to the withdrawal of access. Thus it appears that the SSF at issue here contains a number of documents, some of which may constitute "correspondence," and that other documents in the SSF, such as the police investigative reports, may not constitute "correspondence" at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the documents in the SSF constitute "correspondence," there is another criterion they must meet to be included under this clause, i.e., they must be "relat[ed] to this case." The term "this case" clearly refers to appellant's appeal to the MSPB. Thus, this clause of the agreement relates only to correspondence relating to Mr. Hammons' removal, and his appeal to the MSPB. This criterion does not place the SSF beyond the scope of the clause, however, because the agency's regulation requires that copies of administrative or disciplinary actions be included in the file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, based on the analysis above, that the meaning of the term "correspondence relating to this case" is unclear, with respect to whether it applies to some or all of the documents in the appellant's SSF. Therefore we turn to parole evidence to determine the intent of the parties as to the meaning of this term. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence in the record establishes that the term was not intended to require the destruction of the appellant's SSF. The evidence includes: (1) the affidavit of Col. Patterson stating that neither Mr. Hammons' security clearance nor his SSF was addressed in the settlement agreement; (2) the affidavit of Ms. Joan M. Wright, Chief, Personnel Security Division, Directorate of Security and Communications Management for the 497th Intelligence Group, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C., stating: (a) that Col. Patterson, who signed the settlement agreement for the agency, is not authorized to destroy investigative or security files; (b) that, according to AFI 31-501, Paragraph 1.1.4, the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force has delegated to the 497th IG the sole authority in the Air Force to grant, deny, and revoke security clearance eligibility for Air Force personnel and that no other unit or person in the Air Force has authority to make such determinations; (c) that AFI 31-501, Paragraph 7.5.4 requires the 497th IG to retain the case file and the certificate of investigation on civilian employees who are not retained; (d) that the 497th IG will not destroy any documents in appellant's SSF unless ordered to do so by the Secretary of the Air Force or a person delegated that authority by the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force; and (e) that no one at Carswell Field (where the appellant was employed) has the authority to order removal of documents from the SSF. The appellant has presented no evidence to contradict the agency's evidence that its representative was not authorized to commit the agency to destroy the appellant's SSF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation in this case is different from that in the two cases relied on by the administrative judge, <span class="Italic">Kramer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 187 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Army</span>, 33 MSPR 430 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Kramer</span> the agency representative conceded he intended to delete the documents at issue; in <span class="Italic">Rose</span> too, the agency conceded that its representative agreed to delete certain documents. In <span class="Italic">Rose</span> the Army failed to cite any regulations denying it authority to expunge the records. In this case, however, the affidavits of Col. Patterson and Ms. Wright and the Air Force regulations cited by the agency constitute parole evidence that the agency did not intend the settlement agreement to cover the SSF, and that Col. Patterson had no authority to destroy the SSF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency was not required to destroy the SSF, and that it has complied with the settlement agreement. The petition for enforcement is DISMISSED. This is the final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the decisions, some earlier described, are not consistent, materiality of the disclosure may become important when the parties dispute the significance of a disclosure made in violation of a nondisclosure clause. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 71 MSPR 181 (1996), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 124 F.3d 1439 (Fed.

DHUD</span>, 78 MSPR 25 (1998), <span class="Italic">post</span>, provides an example of the Board's analysis, 71 MSPR at 190-91:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One question raised in this case is whether the uncontroverted facts regarding the communication between Guarraia and Marcy establish a breach of the MOU, and, if so, whether such breach was a material one. The MOU provides that "no HUD employee or official will provide any information to any other person, agency, or organization concerning Mr. Thomas' employment, save for the information that is accessible under OPM regulations from Thomas' [Official Personnel File], and no information will be provided by any employee or official to any other person concerning this agreement or the reasons for Thomas's departure from HUD, or other adverse actions, performance rating, or the terms of the settlement between Thomas and HUD; provided that HUD may release to suitable requesters the dates of Thomas' employment, the positions he held, and the fact that he resigned for personal reasons." The discussion between Guarraia and Marcy included the fact of an IG investigation involving the appellant, a fact that was not included among those that may be released by HUD regarding the appellant. Accordingly, we conclude that the agency breached the terms of the MOU.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We consider, however, whether the breach was material. A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Sena v. Department of Defense</span>, 66 MSPR 458, 465 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the overarching purpose of the MOU appears to be that no negative information regarding the appellant that might hinder his employment efforts outside of HUD be disseminated by a HUD official. What is clear from the uncontroverted deposition testimony of Ferrara, Marcy, Guarraia, and Walker is that none viewed the appellant in a negative light. Walker thought highly of the appellant and Guarraia knew nothing about him, except of the possibility of an IG investigation, which she thought was a neutral fact. Marcy found nothing negative in the possibility of an IG investigation, and, in any event, Ferrara apparently successfully dispelled any possible inference that the IG investigation revealed anything negative about the appellant. As noted above, the record establishes that neither Guarraia nor Marcy knew any details of the appellant's employment with HUD, and, although Walker and Ferrara knew some details because the appellant had informed them, they did not communicate their information to Guarraia or Marcy. Nothing that Marcy learned from HUD official Guarraia hindered the appellant's chance for employment with DOJ. We find therefore that there was no material breach of the MOU by a HUD official.</p>

DHUD</span>, 78 MSPR 25, 29 (1998), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case pits a government agency against an ostensibly undesirable employee who complains that the agency, having promised not to tell future employers about the employee's performance, broke its promise. The employee, who had agreed to resign in exchange for the agency's promise, wants to renege on his settlement. When the agency refused to let him, he took his case to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"). The Board held that, despite the agency's having broken its promise, the agency could hold the employee to the agreement. The Board is wrong; we reverse and remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">George W. Thomas, Jr. ("Petitioner") began his career with the Federal Government in 1974. After 10 years of employment, he became the Manager of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's ("HUD" or "agency") Richmond, Virginia office. However, on May 7, 1990, <span id="Page_5123"></span>Mr. Thomas was demoted from Manager of the Richmond office, a GM-15 position, to Equal Opportunity Specialist in the agency's Philadelphia, Pennsylvania office, a GS-13 position. The demotion was based on charges of mismanagement and abuse of supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thomas appealed the agency's action to the Board. Rather then defend its action the agency entered into a settlement agreement with Thomas. The settlement agreement included a carefully crafted Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU"), spelling out in considerable detail Thomas's requirements regarding confidentiality and the creation a "clean record."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to confidentiality of the deal, the agreement provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[N]o information will be provided by any [HUD] employee or official to any other person concerning this agreement or the reasons for Thomas' departure from HUD, or other adverse action, performance rating, or the terms of the settlement between Thomas and HUD; provided that HUD may release to suitable requesters the dates of Thomas' employment, the positions he held, and the fact that he resigned for personal reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement further provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that all documentation relating to the relevant adverse action proposal and decision would be removed from Thomas's official personnel file, and that "there will be no reference, directly or indirectly, by coding or any other manner, to the fact that an adverse action was initiated or taken, that a Board appeal was filed, or that this settlement occurred."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the agreement, Thomas was restored to his original pay grade and awarded back pay and cost-of-living increases. He was then placed in a one year Intergovernmental Personnel Assignment ("IPA") with Virginia State University. This IPA was later extended through September 5, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the summer of 1992, as his IPA neared completion, Thomas contacted a Department of Justice ("DOJ") official about the possibility of continuing his employment with the Federal Government, and this official relayed the inquiry to another DOJ official, Kristine Marcy. Subsequently Ms. Marcy contacted Thomas, and the two discussed the possibility of his working at DOJ. After talking to Thomas, Ms. Marcy contacted her friend and former colleague, Leonora Guarraia, a HUD official. This contact began a series of events which caused the settlement agreement to begin to unravel, thereby resulting in the agency's breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Guarraia, she contacted James Walker, an Executive Officer in the Secretary's Office at HUD, to see whether he knew anything about Thomas. According to Walker, he told Guarraia that he knew Thomas, that Thomas had worked in congressional affairs at HUD, and that he saw him frequently then. He said that Thomas had been selected for the Manager position in Richmond, Virginia, and that there had been some problems there. Walker testified that he was trying to help Thomas get placed, but that "I didn't want [Guarraia] coming back and saying, well, you didn't tell me that." Guarraia then called Marcy to relay the information she obtained from Walker. According to Marcy, Guarraia told her that Thomas had been the subject of an Inspector General ("IG") matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thomas contends that this was a breach of the agreement because the IG's investigation was used by the agency as a justification for recommending his demotion. We agree with Thomas's argument that Guarraia's disclosure to Marcy of the IG investigation clearly violated the specific prohibition against disclosing to requesters any information apart from the dates of Thomas's employment, the positions he held, and that he resigned for personal reasons. Thomas also contends, and we agree, that the conversation also violated the general non-disclosure provisions in both the Settlement Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding prohibiting the dissemination of information concerning adverse actions taken by the agency against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the end of Thomas's IPA with Virginia State University, he informed the agency that he was withdrawing his "Request for Personnel Action," a form labeled SF-52, which was submitted pursuant to the MOU in 1990. The agency refused to allow the withdrawal and processed the SF-52, effecting Thomas's separation from the agency on September 6, 1992. Thomas then filed another appeal to the Board, alleging that the agency acted improperly and illegally by not permitting him to withdraw his resignation. Thomas sought to withdraw his resignation and to rescind both the settlement agreement and the MOU.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question in this case is whether HUD, when it failed to comply with the express limits of the confidentiality provision of the MOU, materially breached the settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found as a fact, and the evidence clearly supports that finding, that HUD breached the confidentiality provision of the MOU. As discussed above, Ms. Marcy of DOJ learned from a HUD official that petitioner had been the subject of an IG investigation. Because HUD was prohibited from releasing any adverse information and was only permitted to disclose "the dates of Thomas' employment, the positions he held, and the fact that he resigned for personal reasons," the agency clearly breached the confidentiality provisions of the MOU.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, concluded that HUD's breach was not material. A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1104 (1964). In this case, the agency's breach of the confidentiality provision is a matter of vital importance and goes to the essence of this contract. The agency's agreement to deny to potential future employers, including other agencies of the United States Government, the truth about Thomas's performance at HUD was the major benefit that Thomas received in exchange for agreeing to resign from his position. The Board gave credence to the after-the-fact testimony from the DOJ officials that their learning of the fact that Thomas had been the subject of an IG investigation would not influence their view of his employability. Even if that testimony were believed, that knowledge at a minimum would put a responsible employing official on inquiry notice, which was exactly what Thomas wanted to avoid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board offered as an alternative ground that the language of the MOU--the limitations on HUD's disclosures were effective "[a]t and after the time of [Thomas's] resignation" was ambiguous as to when the vow of silence took effect. The Board read it to mean not at the time Thomas submitted his resignation in 1990, but rather at the time it became effective in 1992. That reading makes little sense, since the purpose of the two year delay was to permit the agency to move Thomas out of the agency promptly while giving him a period of time to find other employment. If during that time the agency was free to broadcast the bad news, a large part of the purpose of the agreement would disappear. When a term of an agreement is ambiguous, and the Board was correct in so finding, the ambiguity should be resolved in a manner that is consistent with the purpose and effect of the agreement and with the intent of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It may well be that it is virtually impossible for agencies to ensure that settlement agreements such as this, requiring the whitewashing of an employee's disciplinary record, can be performed to the letter. Even if some agency officials are willing to palm off their problems on others, including sister agencies, without revealing the truth about an employee, there is always the risk that another person who knows the facts will not remain silent. Perhaps as a matter of sound governmental administration such agency agreements should be prohibited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is understandable, however, why employees who face disciplinary action would readily agree to such a settlement despite its risks. And one possible view of the matter could be that such an employee assumes the risk that, despite the agency's agreed efforts, someone will leak the information. When, however, the leak comes directly from a responsible official inside the agency in response to an inevitable inquiry from a potential employer, we cannot permit the agency that willingly entered into such an arrangement to breach it without being held responsible. To do so would be to condone what would be essentially an empty promise made by the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the breach of the settlement agreement is material, Thomas was discharged from his contractual duty to resign, and was entitled to withdraw his SF-52 "Request for Personnel Action." <span class="Italic">See Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 237 cmt. a (1979). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tretchick v. Department of Transport.</span>, 109 F.3d 749, 751-52 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("If the agreement is shown to be invalid or the agency is found to have breached the agreement,...the agreement may not constitute a valid basis for the agency to refuse the employee's withdrawal.")<span class="Italic">. See also Scharf v. Department of Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Thomas attempted to withdraw his resignation. Because the agency denied his attempt, the purported resignation became an involuntary one, and the agency's action in processing his rescinded offer to resign constituted a removal. Unless the removal was carried out in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, it is unlawful and Thomas is entitled to the remedies provided by law. Since the Board dismissed Thomas's appeal on the grounds of a voluntary resignation, the matter is remanded to the Board for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand from the court the Board concluded, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 78 MSPR 25, 28-29 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's resignation is presumed to be a voluntary action and, as such, it is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wilson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 51 MSPR 212, 214 (1991). An employee generally has the right to withdraw his resignation, however, if he does so before it is effective, and the agency's refusal to permit withdrawal without a valid reason renders the resignation involuntary and thus within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harmon v. Department of Defense,</span> 50 MSPR 218, 220-21 (1991). A separation pursuant to an involuntary resignation is a constructive removal action, entitling the employee to the procedural due process protections of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 51 MSPR at 214. When an employee attempts to withdraw a resignation prior to its effective date and the agency refuses to accept the withdrawal, the <span id="Page_5124"></span>burden shifts to the agency to establish, by preponderant evidence, that it had a valid reason for its refusal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Einstein v. Department of the Army</span>, 26 MSPR 404, 408 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant attempted to withdraw his resignation before it was effective. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, 63 MSPR at 653. The agency refused to accept the withdrawal based on the MOU. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the court found, the agency breached the MOU. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 124 F.3d at 1442. Based on our earlier finding that, if the agency breached the MOU, the MOU did not constitute a valid basis for its refusal to allow the appellant to withdraw his resignation, we now find that the agency did not meet its burden to prove that it had a valid reason to refuse the appellant's resignation withdrawal request. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 63 MSPR at 657; <span class="Italic">Einstein</span>, 26 MSPR at 408.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the agency was required to allow the appellant to withdraw his resignation, and its refusal to allow the withdrawal constituted a constructive removal. <span class="Italic">See Wisdom v. Department of Defense,</span> 63 MSPR 333, 336 (1994). Further, since the agency removed the appellant without providing him any of the due process protections mandated under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513, we reverse the agency's action for lack of minimum due process. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was interpreted in <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 541, 546-47 (1998), to mean that a broad neutral-reference provision will be applied with an expectation of knowledge or inquiry by human resources officials as to possible strictures of confidentiality:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below in response to the petition for enforcement that Gautney is not an employee in the Personnel Services Department of the Dallas District Office and that "[t]he agency cannot be held accountable for alleged conversation between neighbors or any other unofficial rumor mills." The settlement agreement does not identify specific persons who are subject to the neutral reference provision. When a term of an agreement is ambiguous, the ambiguity should be resolved in a manner that is consistent with the purpose and effect of the agreement and with the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 124 F.3d at 1442. We do not agree with the agency that the neutral reference term applies only to employees in the Personnel Services Department of the Dallas District Office. As the court in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> noted, inadvertent leaks are an inherent risk in confidentiality agreements. "When, however, the leak comes directly from a responsible official inside the agency in response to an inevitable inquiry from a potential employer, we cannot permit the agency that willingly entered into such an arrangement to breach it without being held responsible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because of the lack of evidence in the record, we are unable to determine whether Gautney was obligated by the neutral reference provision of the settlement agreement not to disclose adverse information about the appellant. However, as a high level manager in Human Resources, presumably familiar with personnel issues, he might be expected to be experienced with similar settlement agreements and to be cautious about revealing information to a prospective employer of a former agency employee. Thus, we find it necessary to remand this petition to afford the parties an opportunity to submit further evidence to substantiate or refute the allegation that agency personnel violated the settlement agreement's provision that the appellant would be given "a neutral reference for outside employment."</p>

USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3370), involved a settlement that had as one objective obtaining a disability retirement for the appellant. The agreement had a typical confidentiality clause:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All parties agree that it is in the best interests of the parties to keep confidential the terms and conditions of this Settlement. The parties, as a term and condition of the Settlement, agree to keep the terms of the agreement confidential and not to disclose said information to any third party other than legal counsel and those who have a need to know the terms in order to implement the agreement. The appellant is not precluded from providing a copy of this agreement to OPM for purposes of pursuing her application for disability retirement or concerning any inquiry into her suitability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">King-Roberts</span> the Postal Service disclosed to OPM, upon OPM's inquiry into appellant's retirement application, the settlement agreement and, apparently, a notice of proposed removal and the removal decision. When, after her retirement application was denied, the appellant learned of some disclosures, she filed an enforcement petition with the Board and sought to rescind the settlement. Reversing the AJ, who determined that OPM had a right to the information, the Board dismissed as unfounded the agency's assertions that OPM's operating instructions, the Privacy Act, or the Freedom of Information Act authorized the disclosures to OPM, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 468-71:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement clearly indicated that it was to remain confidential. Pursuant to paragraph 6 of the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that they would not disclose the terms of the settlement to "any third party" with the limited exception of legal counsel and those who need to know "in order to implement the agreement." If any ambiguity remained, it was removed by the final sentence of paragraph 6 which provides that, notwithstanding the preceding confidentiality provision, "[t]he appellant is not precluded from providing this agreement to OPM for purposes of pursuing her disability retirement or concerning an inquiry into her suitability." Clearly then, the parties contemplated that OPM might request information and agreed that only the appellant, not the agency, could release the settlement agreement to OPM. Therefore, the agency's disclosure of the agreement to OPM was a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that, despite the terms of the settlement agreement, the agency was required, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 USC &#x00A7; 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a, to release the notice of proposed removal, the removal decision letter, and the settlement agreement itself to OPM. The Board will consider the applicability of FOIA and the Privacy Act to the disclosures at issue in this case because the agency's reliance on its administrative manual and OPM's regulations arguably gave rise to a claim that it was required under either Act to release the settlement agreement, the notice of proposed removal, and the removal decision letter to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service is subject to both FOIA and the Privacy Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 410(b)(1) ("section 552...[and] section 552a" of title 5 USC "shall apply to the Postal Service"); <span class="Italic">see generally Mount v. United States Postal Service,</span> 79 F.3d 531 (6th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Swenson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 890 F.2d 1075 (9th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Birch v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service,</span> 803 F.2d 1206 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure that the public has access to information and records held or maintained by the government. The basic purpose of the Privacy Act is to prevent government officials from disclosing information on an individual to a third party without the individual's consent. FOIA and the Privacy Act were not intended to increase a government agency's discretion as to what it could release or decline to disclose to another agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 552, 552a; <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 725 F.2d 1403, 1412 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ("neither [FOIA nor the Privacy Act] was passed to increase agency discretion as to what to disclose or hold back"); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> Preamble to Privacy Act, Pub. L. No. 93-579, &#x00A7; 2(b), 88 Stat. 1896 (1974). Indeed, FOIA was not intended to be used by one government agency to provide information to another agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(a), (b) (each agency shall make certain records and information available to the "public"); <span class="Italic">Bartel</span>, 725 F.2d at 1412. Thus, to the extent the agency in this case argued before the administrative judge that its disclosure of the settlement agreement, notice of proposed removal, and removal decision letter to OPM was sanctioned under FOIA, its argument was meritless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the portion of the Privacy Act that the administrative judge found required disclosure of the settlement agreement, notice of proposed removal, and removal decision letter to OPM, is not a defense to the agency's breach of the settlement agreement. The Privacy Act provides in relevant part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be [permitted under any of 12 codified exceptions].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b). One of the exceptions is when disclosure would be required under FOIA. 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2). This provision applies only when there is an actual FOIA request for the record involved, however. <span class="Italic">See Bartel</span>, 725 F.2d at 1412; <span class="Italic">see generally Kiraly v. Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 728 F.2d 273, 276 (6th Cir. 1984). As stated above, FOIA was not intended to cover the exchange of information between agencies, and in any event there is no evidence that OPM made a request to the Postal Service under FOIA for Postal Service records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must also be emphasized that, although under FOIA all agency records are required to be released (to the public) upon a properly made written request unless FOIA provides a discretionary exemption from disclosure, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(b)(1)-(9); <span class="Italic">see generally Vaughn v. Rosen</span>, 484 F.2d 820, 823 (D.C. Cir. 1973), the structure and interplay of FOIA and the Privacy Act demonstrate that an agency seeking records from another agency was expected by Congress to do so consistent with the Privacy Act, and to meet the relevant "condition of disclosure" set forth in the Privacy Act. That condition, again, is that the individual to whom a record pertains either requests disclosure, or gives prior written consent to disclosure, of the record. 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b). In this case, it was an OPM representative, not the appellant, who requested a copy of the settlement agreement, notice of proposed removal, and removal decision letter, and there is no indication that the appellant requested that the records at issue be disclosed to OPM or that she gave her prior written consent to their <span id="Page_5125"></span>release to OPM. Furthermore, the agency did not explicitly allege that the disclosure of the documents was authorized by the Privacy Act, nor did it specify what exception(s) to the Privacy Act's general prohibition against disclosure it believes may be applicable. Given that the agency neither explicitly alleged that its disclosures were authorized by the Privacy Act nor asserted that the disclosures were within one of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition against disclosure, the agency has failed to establish that it had authority under the Privacy Act to disclose the records at issue to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, given the overriding and unambiguous language of the settlement agreement, the agency's argument that its administrative manual and OPM's regulations required or permitted the release of the settlement agreement is without merit. In essence, the position of the agency and the administrative judge is that the Privacy Act, FOIA, OPM's regulations, and the agency's own administrative manual supersede the broadly-worded confidentiality provision of the settlement agreement. The Board, however, has held that the words of a settlement agreement are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Baig,</span> 66 MSPR at 274. The Board will not interpret such a frequently-used provision regarding confidentiality as actually containing the very broad exception argued for by the agency. It should also be noted that the settlement agreement was previously found to be lawful by the administrative judge, i.e., she did not find that the confidentiality provision violated the Privacy Act, FOIA, or OPM's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the agency's breach of the settlement agreement was not justified under FOIA or the Privacy Act, we must consider whether this breach was a material one warranting rescission of the settlement agreement. A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Littlejohn,</span> 69 MSPR at 62 (citing 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on</span> <span class="Italic">Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1104 (1964)). The Board considers the violation of nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements to be serious "because condoning such violations would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The last sentence of paragraph 6 of the settlement agreement states that the appellant is not precluded from submitting a copy of the agreement to OPM for purposes of its adjudication of her disability application. Clearly, this term contemplates that the appellant, and only the appellant, was permitted under the agreement to provide a copy of the agreement to OPM. Given OPM's request, the agency could and should have contacted the appellant and allowed her to handle the request. In addition, the appellant asserts, without rebuttal, that the breach is irrevocable and indicates that the agency cannot correct the breach. Accordingly, we find that the confidentiality provision was a vital component of the settlement agreement and that the agency's action constituted a material breach of the settlement agreement. Having found that the agency materially breached the settlement agreement by releasing a copy of it to OPM without the appellant's consent, the Board need not reach the issue of whether the agency also breached the agreement when it released copies of the notice of proposed removal and removal decision letter to OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disclosure made before the effective date of a settlement is not likely to violate the confidentiality agreement contained in the subsequent settlement unless there is evidence that the disclosure constituted deceit by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Altman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 87 MSPR 116, 121 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disclosure implicitly authorized by a settlement does not violate a confidentiality clause. In <span class="Italic">Gray v. DOD</span>, 91 Fed. Appx. 137, 140 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), the settlement required the appellant to cancel his EEO complaint. When he did not, the agency disclosed the settlement terms to EEOC. The the agency's disclosure was necessitated by the appellant's failure to comply with the settlement. There was no breach.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a nondisclosure clause was violated, the appellant had a choice between rescinding the settlement and returning to the appeal or living with the settlement, but the Board would not create a remedy where none was provided in the settlement, <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-10-0110-X-1 (NP 7/29/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requests that we order the agency to inform each of its employees that he or she is bound by the settlement agreements not to speak of the appellant's removal and to give only favorable references of him in the future. The terms of the settlement agreements do not explicitly require the agency to take such action; however, they mandate that the agency will provide only favorable references but do not require the agency to follow a particular method to ensure that it does so. We will not read into the agreement terms not specified by the parties. <span class="Italic">E.g., Flores v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). The parties are, of course, free to enter into another settlement agreement that contains these or any other terms they may agree on. But we will neither order them to do so nor mandate that the agency perform an action not specified in the original agreements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One may have to take steps to avoid the disclosure of settlement conditions in a Board opinion. <span class="Italic">Sternberg v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 56 MSPR 520, 526 (1993), declined to redact from the initial compliance decision a discussion of settlement terms involved in a confidential settlement agreement. The Board did not mention the possibility of obtaining an order sealing the record [discussed in Chapter 1 of the Guide under "<a href="0100-2023-08-031.html#sec1-32">Sealing of Record or Files</a>"] ; instead, the Board merely commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the AJ erred by describing the terms of the settlement agreement in his Compliance Recommendation because paragraph 14 of the agreement requires the parties to keep the terms of the agreement confidential,...and he requests the Board to delete this portion of the Recommended decision. However, the Board's regulations require the AJ to make findings and recommendations concerning the matters raised in a petition for enforcement. 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(4), (5). This necessarily requires discussion of the settlement agreement. The appellant is not entitled to obtain the Board's enforcement of a settlement agreement through a decision which does not discuss the terms of the agreement which he has placed in issue. The appellant could not reasonably have believed that the agreement's confidentiality provision would apply to the Board's decision. The Board was not a party to the agreement, and the Board's appeal form put the appellant on notice that the Board's decisions are available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mansfield v. NMB</span>, 103 MSPR 237, 2006 MSPB 227 (2006), set aside a confidential settlement on the Board's own initiative because of a determination that one set of related terms was contrary to law. The decision revealed essentially all of the terms meant by the parties to be confidential, most of those terms having been earlier found lawful by the AJ. The Board's treatment of the settlement showed that confidentiality may not always be protected by the Board. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Parham v. DHS</span>, DA-0432-16-0254-I-1 (NP 7/20/2022) ("<span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Mansfield v. National Mediation Board</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 23 (2006) (recognizing that the Board has the discretion not to accept a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes when it provides the appellant with pay and benefits not authorized by law)").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without addressing whether a confidentiality clause was included in a settlement, the Board declined to find a breach, or a matter for enforcement, based on an assertion that the agency permitted disclosure of appellant's employment records to another agency employee and by disclosing the appellant's employment history to a prospective employer when the appellant apparently did not follow the agreed-upon reference scheme, <span class="Italic">Mozone v. Dept. of Labor</span>, NY-0752-07-0164-C-1 (NP 5/20/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next reasserts that the agency violated his privacy rights. When he raised this argument below, the appellant alleged that he happened to run into an agency employee, D.S., and that individual reportedly indicated that she had viewed the appellant's records because they were maintained in an unsecured area within the office. The agency responded, in part, by providing a sworn declaration from D.S. in which she acknowledged having a brief conversation with the appellant after running into him. However, D.S. denied that she had viewed any records pertaining to the appellant or told him otherwise. The appellant seems to argue that the administrative judge should have conducted a credibility analysis to address this matter. However, the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's privacy argument, finding that the security of his records was not an issue that could be addressed in this enforcement action. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not have the authority to remedy all matters alleged to be unfair or incorrect; rather, the Board's authority is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Accordingly, even if the appellant had proven that the agency violated his privacy by leaving his personnel records unsecured in an agency office, that issue is beyond the scope of the instant enforcement action. <span class="Italic">See Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 467, 474 (1992) (finding that the Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous, and will not hear a party's complaints about matters that were not included in a settlement agreement). The settlement agreement did not require the agency to store the appellant's records in any particular fashion, nor did it limit access of those records to certain agency employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Doe v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2011) (recognizing that, when an agency has contractually agreed to provide an employee with a clean record, the Board recognizes an implied provision that precludes the agency's disclosure of information regarding the rescinded adverse action to third parties). Accordingly, the agency's purported violation of the appellant's privacy cannot be addressed in this enforcement action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reasserts that the agency violated the settlement agreement by giving out his employment history to a prospective employer, Federation of Multi-Cultural Programs, Inc., verbally, when it should have done so in writing. We find that this argument does not provide a basis for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the only evidence the appellant presented to establish that the agency provided a verbal reference check to Federation of Multi-Cultural Programs, Inc., is a form generally stating that the entity <span id="Page_5126"></span>verified the appellant's employment and personal references in July 2008. The appellant has failed to identify any evidence to show that this included verification of his employment at the agency or prove that such verification, if it occurred, was verbal. Moreover, the administrative judge properly concluded that the appellant, himself, was in breach of the settlement agreement because he failed to formally notify the agency in advance of this and other reference checks. While the settlement required the agency to utilize a previously agreed upon written reference, the appellant was required to "notify the Agency prior to any inquiries from non-[agency] employers for employment references." Therefore, even if the agency provided a verbal verification of the appellant's employment to Federation of Multi-Cultural Programs, Inc., as alleged, he is not entitled to any relief. <span class="Italic">See Wofford v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2010) (recognizing the unclean hands doctrine, which "closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the defendant") (quoting <span class="Italic">Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co</span>., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A practical note for practical lawyers: all MSPB appeals are closed out by an initial decision, including settled cases. The initial decision may do no more than state that a settlement is accepted into the record for purposes of enforcement and that the appeal is dismissed with prejudice, or dismissed as settled. The settlement may include a confidentiality or nondisclosure clause, but the decision closing the case out contains the appellant's name, identifies the agency, and bears a docket number. That docket number, for example, 0752 or 0432, tells a reader knowledgeable of the Board's nomenclature for identifying cases that the appeal closed out is an adverse action or a performance-based action. Initial decisions, including those closing out settled cases, are provided by the Board to commercial firms that carry databases of Board decisions. A careful and informed researcher could examine one of those databases through a name search and discover that the appellant, perhaps now an applicant for employment, was involved in Board litigation involving an adverse personnel action. To avoid that type of potential disclosure, one must work with the AJ in advance of issuance of the initial decision (and its transmittal to a database provider) to remove the appellant's name through a John Doe designation of the appellant. AJs may or may not agree to that process. The concern may also extend to preliminary initial decisions, for example, initial decisions dismissing appeals without prejudice to the refiling of an appeal. EEOC avoids the problem by captioning all recent decisions with pseudonyms and referring to individuals by title, e.g., "supervisor," or initials.
