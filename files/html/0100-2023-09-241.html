<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-238"><span class="space">1.</span> Regulatory Structure</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Board regulations governing discovery are at 5 CFR 1201.71-.75 (2022). First, a statement of purpose, 5 CFR 1201.71 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proceedings before the Board will be conducted as expeditiously as possible with due regard to the rights of the parties. Discovery is designed to enable a party to obtain relevant information needed to prepare the party's case. These regulations are intended to provide a simple method of discovery. They will be interpreted and applied so as to avoid delay and to facilitate adjudication of the case. Parties are expected to start and complete discovery with a minimum of Board intervention. Discovery requests and responses thereto are not to be filed in the first instance with the Board. They are only filed with the Board in connection with a motion to compel discovery under 1201.73(c) of this part, with a motion to subpoena discovery under 1201.73(d) of this part, or as substantive evidence to be considered in the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At 5 CFR 1201.72 (2022), the Board explains the process and scope of administrative discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Explanation</span>. Discovery is the process, apart from the hearing, by which a party may obtain relevant information, including the identification of potential witnesses, from another person or a party, that the other person or party has not otherwise provided. Relevant information includes information that appears reasonably calculated to <span id="Page_1224"></span>lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. This information is obtained to assist the parties in preparing and presenting their cases. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may be used as a general guide for discovery practices in proceedings before the Board. Those rules, however, are instructive rather than controlling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Scope</span>. Discovery covers any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of documents or other tangible things, and the identity and location of persons with knowledge of relevant facts. Discovery requests that are directed to nonparties and nonparty Federal agencies and employees are limited to information that appears directly material to the issues involved in the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Methods.</span> Parties may use one or more of the methods provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. These methods include written interrogatories to parties, depositions, requests for production of documents or things for inspection or copying, and requests for admission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Limitations.</span> The judge may limit the frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods permitted by these regulations. Such limitations may be imposed if the judge finds that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The discovery sought is cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The party seeking discovery has had sufficient opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unlike practice before EEOC administrative judges, MSPB AJs have the authority to issue subpoenas as a component of discovery (and hearing) processes. As to subpoenas, refer to 5 USC 1221(d) (authorizing the Board to issue subpoenas if the production requested "is not unduly burdensome and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence"). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-09-276.html#sec2-273">Subpoenas</a>" in this chapter.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board discovery procedures, most recently revised by regulatory changes in 2012 and 2015, are established at 5 CFR 1201.73 (2022), with an additional provision concerning discovery in enforcement proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initiating discovery</span>. A party seeking discovery must start the process by serving a request for discovery on the representative of the party or nonparty, or, if there is no representative, on the party or nonparty themselves. The request for discovery must state the time limit for responding, as prescribed in 1201.73(d) of this part, and must specify the time and place of the taking of the deposition, if applicable. When a party directs a request for discovery to the official or employee of a Federal agency that is a party, the agency must make the officer or employee available on official time to respond to the request and must assist the officer or employee as necessary in providing relevant information that is available to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responses to discovery requests</span>. A party or nonparty must answer a discovery request within the time provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, either by furnishing to the requesting party the information requested or agreeing to make deponents available to testify within a reasonable time, or by stating an objection to the particular request and the reasons for the objection.

<p class="Body-Text">2015 regulatory revisions clarified the use of discovery in enforcement proceedings [discussed in <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a>], at 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(9):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discovery may be undertaken in accordance with the Board's regular discovery procedures (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71 through 1201.75 of this part), except that unless otherwise directed by the judge, initial discovery requests must be served no later than 15 days after the alleged noncomplying party files a response to the petition for enforcement as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other Board regulations, discussed in the sections that follow, address the use of depositions and subpoenas.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 8 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> provides guidance concerning discovery's purpose and process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">GENERAL</span>. Board regulations on discovery are set out at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71-.75. Discovery regulations have changed substantially during the Board's existence; thus, earlier case law in this area may not apply under current regulations. Discovery may progress from voluntary cooperation when the parties informally request information from each <span id="Page_1227"></span>other to required cooperation when the Board orders compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73. Discovery requests to nonparties and nonparty Federal agencies are limited to information that appears "directly material" to the issues involved in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(b). AJs should encourage parties to voluntarily comply with discovery requests, because discovery is intended to be a process that the parties use to obtain information relative to an appeal, and it is expected to be conducted with minimum Board intervention. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.71, .72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE</span>. If after reviewing the regulations, precedent, and this chapter, the AJ is still unsure how to rule on a discovery matter, he or she should consult Rules 26-37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance. Although the rules are not controlling, an AJ is likely to be on solid ground by observing them since they represent conventional thought on acceptable procedures. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a); <span class="Italic">see also Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 274, 285 n.7 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was changed as of December 1, 2015. Instead of the language that evidence "reasonably calculated" to lead to admissible evidence is discoverable, the Rule now contains a proportionality limitation. It now states--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Notes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) state that the primary reason for the change is e-discovery: "The burden or expense of proposed discovery should be determined in a realistic way. This includes the burden or expense of producing electronically stored information. Computer-based methods of searching such information continue to develop, particularly for cases involving large volumes of electronically stored information. Courts and parties should be willing to consider the opportunities for reducing the burden or expense of discovery as reliable means of searching electronically stored information become available."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FORMS OF DISCOVERY</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Document Production</span>. A party may request documents in the possession or control of another. The party or person in possession of the requested documents may either provide copies of the documents or make the documents available for photocopying, subject to the discretion of the AJ to rule on an objection to the method selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interrogatories</span>. Parties may ask each other or a nonparty to answer a series of written questions. (Note that while 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(c) refers only to interrogatories "to parties," &#x00A7; 1201.73(e) refers to interrogatories to both parties and nonparties.) These questions must be answered in writing under oath or affirmation. Absent prior approval by the AJ, interrogatories served upon either a party or a nonparty "may not exceed 25 in number, including all discrete subparts." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e(1). Requests to exceed the interrogatory limitations may be granted at the discretion of the AJ. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e)(3). In considering such requests, the AJ shall consider the factors identified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Note: that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not allow for interrogatories to nonparties. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 33. Although when the regulations were amended in 2008, the Board made explicit its intention to limit the submission of interrogatories to other parties, <span class="Italic">see</span> 73 F.R. 18149 (2008), the regulations as revised in 2012 once again allow for service of interrogatories on nonparties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Depositions</span>. Parties may ask each other or potential witnesses written or oral questions to be answered under oath or affirmation. The questions and answers are recorded (at the expense of the requesting party) before a person authorized to administer oaths and not interested in the outcome of the proceedings, such as a court reporter. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 28 and 30. Opportunity for cross-examination is afforded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.75, depositions may be taken by any method on which the parties agree. Accordingly, AJs should not hold the parties to strict compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if (1) the parties have agreed on the method by which the deposition is taken, and (2) the person providing the information in the deposition is subject to penalties for intentional false statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The record of a deposition may be used to substitute for the hearing testimony of a witness who is otherwise unavailable. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed R. Civ. P. 32. AJs may also admit depositions in the interests of efficiency to save hearing time or travel costs. "Absent prior approval by the judge, parties may not take more than 10 depositions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e)(2). Requests to exceed the deposition limitations may be granted at the discretion of the AJ. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e)(3). In considering such requests, the AJ shall consider the factors identified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Request for Admissions</span>. A request for admissions is a request that the other party admit in writing, the truth of certain matters "relating to (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and (B) the genuineness of any described documents" concerning the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a). The purpose of this procedure is to establish facts so that there is no need to present evidence to prove them at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VOLUNTARY DISCOVERY</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Parties' Responsibility</span>. Voluntary discovery is a policy designed to conserve Board resources by giving the parties control over discovery. The parties should be encouraged to cooperate in exchanging information concerning the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AJ's Responsibility</span>. The AJ should send out the acknowledgement order and hearing notice to the parties as soon as possible so that they can pace their discovery efforts. The AJ should also inquire about discovery during early conferences, and if it becomes necessary, offer informal direction. This enables the AJ to learn the status of voluntary discovery efforts and identify potential problems that might delay the process. To facilitate the process, an AJ may assist in negotiating the reasonableness of the request during the early stages of discovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DISCOVERY REQUESTS</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents</span>. All discovery requests must specify time limits for responding. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(a). A notice of deposition must specify the date, time, and place of the deposition. The parties may agree to reschedule or postpone discovery during the voluntary stage. Deposition witnesses must give their testimony at the designated time and place stated in the request for deposition or in the subpoena unless the parties agree on another time or place. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Service</span>. A party must serve a copy of each discovery request on the representative of the other party or on the party if there is no representative. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PREMATURE FILINGS</span>. The AJ must not accept for filing any requests for discovery, responses to discovery requests, and/or objections unless such information is submitted in support of a motion to compel or opposition to a motion to compel. Instructions to the parties regarding this prohibition are included in the acknowledgment order. Any material gained in discovery that a party wishes to enter into the record must be submitted as an exhibit or in connection with a pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">TIME LIMITS FOR DISCOVERY</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial Discovery Requests</span>. Discovery requests must be initiated within 30 days after the date of issuance of the acknowledgment order (in compliance cases, within 15 days of the filing of the response to the petition for enforcement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responses to Discovery Requests</span>. A party or nonparty must file a response to a discovery request promptly, but not later than 20 days (15 in compliance cases) after the date of service of the discovery request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Supplemental Requests</span>. If the requesting party finds it necessary to make additional requests based on the responses it receives, these supplemental requests must be served within 10 days after the date of service of the prior responses unless otherwise directed by the AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responses to Supplemental Requests</span>. The time limit for responding to a supplemental request for discovery is also 20 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Completion of Discovery</span>. Discovery should be completed within the time designated by the AJ. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(4). If no such period is designated, discovery must be completed no later than the prehearing or close of record conference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ must ensure that due process requirements are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Computation of Time</span>. In computing the number of days allowed for complying with any deadline, 5 days are added to a party's deadline for responding to a document served by mail unless a different deadline is specified by the AJ. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">MOTIONS TO COMPEL</span>. When party fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request (e.g., by objections, lapse of time, repeated delay, nonresponsive answers, etc.), the requesting party may ask for the Board's assistance by filing a motion to compel. Parties must file motions to compel within 10 days of the date of service of objections or the expiration of the time limit for response, when no response has been received. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1228"></span>a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;The motion must be accompanied by a copy of the original discovery request and a copy of the response or, if no response was received, an affidavit or sworn statement to that effect<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(c)(1)(i), (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;The motion must explain the relevance and materiality of the information sought. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(c)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opposition</span>. The recipient of a discovery request may respond to the motion to compel either by complying or by explaining the failure to comply. The recipient or a party has 10 days from the date of service to respond or object to a motion to compel. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(3). Processing problems could arise if the AJ waited for this 10-day period to elapse (plus 5 days to allow for mailing) before ruling on the motion. The AJ has a choice of two courses of action to prevent delays, as explained below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Preventing Delay</span>. Upon receipt of a motion to compel, the AJ should promptly initiate a conference call with the parties to determine the nature of opposition and to attempt to resolve it before ruling on the motion. The AJ should be prepared to grant requests for more time to respond from the opposing party due to the short time frames involved. When the motion is deniable on its face, the AJ should rule on the motion without waiting for a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Formal Action by the AJ</span>. After a motion to compel is filed, the AJ must examine it and the underlying discovery requests to ensure that they meet all regulatory time limits and requirements. An AJ has broad discretion in rejecting motions to compel due to untimely discovery requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Esparza v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 186 (1984). Motions to compel must be ruled on promptly to enable the parties ample time to complete discovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">9.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE'S DISCOVERY AUTHORITY</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;An AJ has authority to order parties, including agency employees, to respond to discovery motions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(4). AJs may have delegated authority to do the following: (1) Issue subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses and production of documentary or other evidence; (2) order the taking of depositions; and (3) order responses to written interrogatories and requests for admissions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;An AJ's broad authorities concerning discovery matters are illustrated by the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 435, 438-42 (1998). In that case, the Board: made clear that an AJ's discovery-related rulings would be reviewed under and abuse of discretion standard; supported the AJ's decision to require the agency to produce documents for his <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection, even when a claim of privilege might allow the agency to withhold the documents from the appellant; held that records need not be subject to mandatory disclosure, as under the Privacy Act, before an AJ may order discovery as to them; affirmed that the parties may not place conditions on documents released by a discovery order; ruled that even if an AJ had erred in disseminating discovery information, that error would not allow a party to refuse to comply with any remaining portion of the order; and upheld AJ's authority to impose sanctions for a party's failure to comply with discover orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">10.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SUSPENDING CASES FOR DISCOVERY</span>. An AJ may suspend a case two times for up to 30 days each. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.28. Among the reasons commonly given for such a suspension is to allow the parties to complete discovery. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 3, section 12 for details.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Responsibility for conducting discovery lies with the parties. Until 1989, the governing statute, 5 USC 1205(b)(2), authorized only an administrative law judge to issue a subpoena, compel answers to interrogatories, or order depositions. Now, following statutory amendment, an AJ has that authority under 5 USC 1204(b)(2), but the order of a AJ (other than to obtain a subpoena) is not necessary if the parties cooperate. The AJ becomes involved in the discovery dispute if a party files a motion seeking to compel or protect against a discovery procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because discovery is conducted between the parties, the AJ is usually unaware of the documents produced, the questions asked and responses given, the admission of facts, and the content of depositions. If a party desires to use information obtained through discovery in its case as part of the Board appeal record, that party must get the information into the record. It does not get there by itself. Aside from motions to compel discovery and use of deposition transcripts for impeachment during hearing, probative discovery materials are entered as exhibits accompanying the prehearing submission. It could occur that during a hearing, a discovery response not earlier submitted as an exhibit becomes useful, and then the parties and AJ can determine if, and how, it will come into the record. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-275.html#sec2-272">Entry of Discovery Material into Record</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Normally, the AJ is not involved with discovery unless her assistance is requested by a party. The Board discourages AJs from injecting themselves into the discovery process, <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 72 MSPR 332, 336-37 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for appeal, the appellant requested that the agency answer numerous questions concerning the many forms that the agency provided to her upon her removal. These questions relate to matters concerning her retirement options, the disposition of her Thrift Savings Plan and retirement accounts, and her insurance options. The appellant also requested the agency to provide the Board with numerous documents relating to her employment generally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge acknowledged the appeal with the Board's standard acknowledgment order on October 11, 1995. Attached to the acknowledgment order was a second Order dated October 11, 1995. In this second Order, despite the fact that most of the appellant's requests concern information that is irrelevant to the appeal, the administrative judge took the extraordinary step of <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> ordering the agency not to comply with the appellant's request. The administrative judge also referred the appellant to the section concerning discovery in her acknowledgment order as the appropriate means of obtaining information from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's order was ill-advised. By ordering the agency not to comply with the appellant's request, the administrative judge prevented the agency from answering even routine, administrative questions about such matters as the appellant's Thrift Savings Plan account, thereby exceeding her authority and improperly injecting herself into matters unrelated to the issues on appeal. Moreover, the administrative judge's order may have prevented the parties from reaching an informal resolution of the appellant's request for information, a process that the Board encourages in the interest of adjudicatory economy. The better course would have been simply to remind the appellant of the Board's discovery procedures, to answer any questions about discovery that the parties may have had, and to remove herself from the discovery process until her participation was necessary to resolve any motions that might arise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discovery rules should be read with care. The discovery procedure is simple enough, if the rules are followed. What may be of some assistance is discussion of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, treated by the Board as guidelines for discovery. A few additional references to Board rules are added in the sections on depositions and requests for admissions. The Federal Circuit considered interrogatories calling for explanation of damages and contention interrogatories in <span class="Italic">MLC Intellectual Property LLC v. Micron Technology</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210826187">10 F.4th 1358</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Board has not yet made regulatory mention of the December 1, 2006, amendments to Federal Rule 26, involving electronic discovery. For a good overview of discovery rulings by the Board, obtain from the Board a copy of Paul Streb's <span class="Italic">Discovery and Subpoenas: A Digest of Selected Statutes, Regulations, Federal Rules, Merit Systems Protection Board and Court Decisions, and Legislative History</span> (August 7, 1989).
