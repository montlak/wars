<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-73"><span class="space">H.</span> SUBSTANTIALLY INNOCENT</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Before addressing the doctrinal evolution of the "substantial innocence" test, we note that it is not the same as the "clearly without merit" or "knew or should have known" standards, and for this reason all standards should be pleaded in a fee petition. The Board emphasized the distinctions, remanding an appeal for further analysis, in <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 119, 122 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>...the court held that "substantial innocence" is an operative <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category in and of itself. Further in <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 MSPR 559 (1986), the Board held that an analysis of whether fees are warranted because the agency's action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded may be appropriate despite the inapplicability of the substantial innocence subcategory. Thus, the discussion of whether fees are warranted because the appellant is substantially innocent does not end the need to discuss the appellant's argument that fees may be warranted under the other subcategories of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category two.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the tests may overlap. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coffman v. OSC &#x0026; DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 18, &#x00B6; 15 (2022) ("However, both the Board and the court have recognized that <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors 2 and 5 are related and may sometimes overlap. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1457 n.5; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 325, 332 n.5 (1987). Indeed, the court in <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> noted that, if an agency ‘possesses no credible evidence prior to the hearing before the Board ([<span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor] 5), the result of the case will <span class="Italic">usually</span> be in favor of the employee ([<span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor] 2).' <span class="Italic">Yorkshire,</span> 746 F.2d at 1457 n.5 (emphasis in original)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">James v. Santella</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/328/f3d/1374/james-v-santella">328 F.3d 1374</a> (Fed. Cir. 2003) (applying the test to OSC disciplinary cases); <span class="Italic">Curtis v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 4, 7 (1987) (substantial innocence standard does not apply to disability retirement cases; all other <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories apply); <span class="Italic">Belcher v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 362, 365 (1988) (substantial innocence standard was inapplicable to retirement cases (citing <span class="Italic">Simmons v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 559, 564-65 (1986))).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The substantial innocence standard of recovery of counsel fees was adopted for the successful defense of an OSC disciplinary case in <span class="Italic">Santella v. Special Counsel</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SANTELLA_FRANK_CB_1215_91_0007_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248436.pdf">86 MSPR 48</a>, 59-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-35 (2000), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 90 MSPR 172 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The&#x22A0;substantially innocent&#x22A0; category may be applied when a motion for attorney fees is filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish entitlement to attorney fees, the petitioners must establish that fees are "warranted in the interest of justice." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1). In <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 MSPR 420, 428-35 (1980), the Board addressed the circumstances under which an attorney fee award would be "warranted in the interest of justice" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g). It listed several examples of situations in which <span id="Page_4601"></span>that criterion could be met, and it included, among those examples, situations in which the employees were "'substantially innocent' of the charges brought by the agenc[ies]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 434-35. In the present case, the petitioners argue that an award is warranted under this "<span class="Italic">Allen</span> category." OSC argues that the "substantially innocent" category should not be applied under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its argument, OSC asserts that the application of the "substantially innocent" category would condition liability for attorney fees on the result of the litigation, rather than on the legitimacy of the prosecution in the first instance. According to OSC, this approach is inappropriate in a case brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 because OSC is a law enforcement agency acting in the interest of the merit system and of the public, because Congress has indicated the importance of vigorous enforcement of the law under this provision, because 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 requires it to file a complaint with the Board if the Special Counsel determines that disciplinary action should be taken, because OSC does not have the control over evidence in its cases that employing agencies have, and because charges such as those made in this case are almost always supported by circumstantial evidence and are therefore difficult to substantiate. OSC also argues that Congress showed its concern regarding the need for vigorous enforcement by OSC by making attorney fee awards "conditional, not automatic" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1); it suggests that a standard similar to that applied under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) be applied in cases such as this; and it suggests that fees be awarded when "OSC abuses its authority by, for example, prosecuting a case in bad faith or without reasonable basis."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the CALJ, we are not persuaded by OSC's reasoning. Again, we return to the fact that Congress used the same language--"warranted in the interest of justice"--in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) that it used in the provisions governing attorney fee awards in appellate jurisdiction cases. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(g), 7701(g). Since well before the enactment of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), our reviewing court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has consistently upheld both the Board's <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories as a whole and its inclusion in those categories of situations in which the employee has been found "substantially innocent" of the charges against him. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Van Fossen v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 749 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (referring to court decisions "mak[ing] it clear that 'substantial innocence' is an operative <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guideline in and of itself"); <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Allen</span> guidelines reasonable and firmly based in statute and legislative history). In the absence of a clearly expressed intent to the contrary, phrases in a new statute that were used in a previous statute on the same or an analogous subject, and that were construed by the courts to have a certain meaning, are presumed to have the same meaning in the new statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 82 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Statutes</span> &#x00A7; 370(b)(1) (1953). Nothing in the statute at issue here or its legislative history indicates that 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) was intended to have a meaning different from the meaning of those other provisions. Under these circumstances, Congress' use of the phrase "warranted in the interest of justice" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) provides strong support for the view that the "substantially innocent" category is applicable to cases arising under that provision just as it is to cases arising under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, while OSC's interests in bringing a disciplinary proceeding under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 differ somewhat from the interests of an employing agency, the nature of charges an employing agency brings against its own employee may be quite similar to the nature of charges OSC may bring. That is, employing agencies, like OSC, may bring actions against their employees that are based on alleged prohibited personnel practices or other violations covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 or &#x00A7; 1216. In fact, OSC has acknowledged elsewhere in its response to the motion at issue here that it is the employing agency, and not OSC, that has primary responsibility for preventing the commission of prohibited personnel practices, and that OSC is simply "given the authority to step in and pursue disciplinary action in those cases where the [employing] agency itself has, for whatever reason, declined to do so." While an employing agency may not be subject to any statutory requirement that it bring disciplinary action against an employee believed to have committed a prohibited personnel practice, there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to make fee awards easier to obtain in cases brought by employing agencies than in cases brought by OSC. Instead, as indicated above, Congress used the same "warranted in the interest of justice" language in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) that it used in authorizing awards in appellate jurisdiction cases. The legislative history of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1201(m)(1) also suggests that Congress intended to provide the same remedy with respect to this matter as it had provided previously to employees disciplined by their own employing agencies, and to make the same standards that previously were applied in the disciplinary cases brought by employing agencies applicable to the new remedy. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 5 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3553 (noting that fee awards were available under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) and (2), that "there is currently no authority for the employee to recover attorneys fees" in a disciplinary action brought by OSC under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215, and that the proposed new provision would "grant[&#8197;] that authority"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) (authorizing Board to award consequential damages to employees subjected to reprisal). The difficulties an employing agency encounters in substantiating charges involving prohibited personnel practices also may be quite similar to those encountered by OSC, and proof of those alleged violations would appear to be as dependent on circumstantial evidence as is proof of OSC's similar allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we are not persuaded that an employing agency's greater control over evidence in its cases warrants the use of a different standard here. Congress has provided OSC with the power to conduct investigations, to issue subpoenas, to order the taking of depositions, and to order responses to written interrogatories. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), (b)(2). To the extent that OSC argues that, due to fears of agency retaliation, it is unrealistic to expect it to receive the same degree of cooperation from agency witnesses as an employing agency would receive, we do not necessarily agree with that contention. In any case, we note that OSC may file a request for a protective order if it deems that action necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.54(d). Perhaps more important, despite any disadvantages OSC may have in obtaining such evidence, Congress does not appear to have suggested, either in the statutory provision at issue here or in its legislative history, that employees would be required to meet more stringent standards in order to receive attorney fee awards in proceedings brought by OSC. As noted above, both the statutory language and the legislative history indicate a congressional intent to apply the same standards applied in cases brought by employing agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although Congress clearly has expressed a strong interest in protecting employees against prohibited personnel practices such as those allegedly committed by the petitioners here, OSC has not explained why that interest does not extend to employing agencies' responsibilities. Yet, we are not aware of any basis for finding that attorney fees should not be awarded to an employee who was found to be substantially innocent of an employing agency's charge that he committed a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the CALJ stated, it is also relevant that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), like OSC, has a function distinct from that of other employing agencies (making retirement-related determinations while at the same time protecting retirement trust fund money) and that the Board nevertheless awards fees in OPM cases under standards that are very similar to those used in adverse action cases. <span class="Italic">See Kent v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 361, 366-69 (1987); <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 MSPR 559, 565 (1986). Although the Board has found the "substantially innocent" category inapplicable in employee-initiated disability retirement appeals, it has done so on the ground that innocence is not a factor in retirement-related appeals. <span class="Italic">Simmons</span>, 31 MSPR at 565. Furthermore, although it has made further modifications in the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories as they apply to OPM retirement cases, it has done so on the ground that it is the employee, rather than OPM, who has the burden of proof in those cases. <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, 33 MSPR at 366. Innocence clearly is a factor in disciplinary cases brought by OSC under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215, just as it is in similar cases brought by employing agencies; and employees do not have the burden of proof in cases brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 any more than they do in disciplinary cases brought by employing agencies. The bases given in <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> and <span class="Italic">Kent</span> for modifying the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories therefore are not relevant here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The stricter standard sought by OSC--a standard similar to that used under the EAJA--would not be appropriate here because, in enacting 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), Congress did not use language similar to that used in the EAJA. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) with 5 USC &#x00A7; 504 (fees are not to be awarded under EAJA if appropriate official "finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust"). In enacting &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), Congress focused solely on enabling employees to receive attorney fee awards warranted in the interest of justice. It did not create a stricter standard for awarding fees. If the Board were to create the stricter standard sought by OSC, there would likely be few, if any, fee awards to prevailing parties, and Congress' intent in enacting this provision would be frustrated.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;OSC also argues that the Board should employ the standard used by federal courts to determine whether a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case is entitled to an attorney fee award<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k) ("In any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee [including expert fees] as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person."). In support of this argument, OSC points out that the Supreme Court has stated that a plaintiff in a Title VII case (including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) will only be liable for fees where the action was "frivolous, unreasonable, or without <span id="Page_4602"></span>foundation." <span class="Italic">See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S. Ct. 694, 54 L. Ed.2d 648 (1978). Again, however, we note the difference in the statutory language Congress used in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) and 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k). In light of the fact that <span class="Italic">Christiansburg</span> was issued in 1978, we must assume that Congress was aware of the courts' application of 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k), and it could have chosen to employ similar language. The fact that it did not detracts from OSC's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with OSC's claim that the use of the "substantially innocent" category in conjunction with section 1204(m) cases would amount to a standard of strict liability that would inhibit its ability to fulfill its mission. In section 7701(g)(1) cases, the Board has consistently stated that it will not automatically award fees under the substantially innocent criterion simply because a charge, or charges, were not sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 33 MSPR 325, 330 (1987). <span class="Italic">See also Wise v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 780 F.2d 997 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (denying fee award although the Board had reversed air traffic controller's removal). There is no reason to believe that the Board cannot also closely analyze attorney fee petitions claiming substantial innocence in cases brought by OSC under section 1204(m)(1). <span class="Italic">Cf. Van Fossen v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 788 F.2d 748 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (the extent of a party's victory, the magnitude of the injustice done the employee and whether the employee was innocent of the more important and greater part of the charges are controlling considerations in determining substantial innocence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, for the reasons stated above, we find that the "substantially innocent" <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category is applicable to cases arising under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The petitioners have shown that they were "substantially innocent" of the charges against them</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC argued below, and reiterates on review, that even if the "substantially innocent" category is applicable here, the petitioners have not shown that they fall within it. In support of this argument, they note that the first recommended decision on the merits of the complaint against the petitioners included a finding that reprisal for protected conduct was a contributing factor in the personnel actions at issue; they asserted below that this finding "remains undisturbed"; and they contended that the petitioners "are not 'substantially innocent' of reprisal when it played a contributing...part in their decision making."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the CALJ that OSC's belief that the contributing factor finding "remains undisturbed" is incorrect. As indicated above, the Board vacated the recommended decision in which that finding was made. <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 65 MSPR at 454. The reason for the absence of any such finding in the Board's final decision was that the Board had concluded in its earlier decision, in effect, that the question of whether reprisal was a contributing factor in the actions at issue was immaterial, and that the relevant inquiry concerned whether reprisal was a "significant factor" in the actions. <span class="Italic">See Santella</span>, 65 MSPR at 456. Moreover, in their exceptions to the second recommended decision, OSC argued that the CALJ had exceeded his authority on remand by making his own findings of fact and credibility determinations, when he should have simply adopted those of the first CALJ. The Board found no merit to that argument, further indicating that no weight should be accorded the first recommended decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the petitioners were substantially innocent turns on the second recommended decision, which the Board adopted in full<span class="Italic">. Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, MSPB Docket No. CB-1215-91-0007-B-1 (Recommended Decision Nov. 13, 1995). <span class="Italic">See Van Fossen</span>, 788 F.2d at 749-50. In that decision, the second CALJ found that OSC proved none of the four charges; in other words, he found that whistleblowing was not a significant factor in any of the four personnel actions the petitioners took. In its final decision, the Board concluded that OSC had not met the required evidentiary showing with respect to any of the charges against the petitioners, i.e., that it had not shown that reprisal was a significant factor in any of the personnel actions at issue in the complaint. <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 77 MSPR at 673. Accordingly, none of the charges were sustained, and the complaint against the petitioners was dismissed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an employee is "substantially innocent" of the charges against him, for attorney fee award purposes, if he "is innocent of the primary or major charges, or of the more important and greater part of the original charges." <span class="Italic">McWilliams v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 MSPR 422, 428-29 (1991). In determining whether this criterion has been met, the Board focuses on the gravity and circumstances of the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">See Van Fossen</span>, 788 F.2d at 750-51. We do not see any basis for finding that unsustained charges can justify a conclusion that an employee was not found to be substantially innocent of the charges. Even if findings with respect to such charges could be regarded as suggesting that the employee's conduct was blameworthy to some extent, the failure to sustain the charges reflects a finding that the required evidentiary showing has not been made, i.e., that the employee is "innocent" of the charges under the standard by which evidence regarding the charges is to be judged. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 525, 528-29 (1987) (the fact that a case was close does not warrant denying attorney fees under the substantial innocence category where the agency failed to prove its charge) (footnote omitted). In this case, as indicated above, all the charges were unsustained. Clearly, therefore, the petitioners were "substantially innocent."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board long maintained that when an employee claimed to be substantially innocent of the charges against him, the AJ should examine the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis on the agency's part. <span class="Italic">Kling v. DOJ</span>, 5 MSPR 410, 413, 5 MSPB 422 (1981). Failure of an agency to prove a charge (falsification of a document) did not demonstrate that fees were warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Jaramillo v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 126, 127 (1984). Substantial innocence sufficient to warrant a fee award was lacking when an agency failed to prove intent to defraud the government, but the appellant admitted falsifying time cards. The demotion was reversed, but fees were denied. <span class="Italic">Coulter v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 388, 389 (1984). But if the appellant was not shown to have been involved in any improper conduct, the employee was substantially innocent and entitled to a fee award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 174, 184-85 (1984) (a consolidated case; the holding was taken from a discussion of the <span class="Italic">Peterson</span> decision). The Board's analysis established the purely innocent employee as the equal to the substantially innocent employee. The formula proved unworkable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "substantial innocence" test proved difficult for the Board to administer. The Board tended to ignore the test when it could, preferring to deny fees on the basis of other tests identified in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>. <span class="Italic">Fekete v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 235, 238 (1984), involving fee petitions filed on behalf of criminal investigators who prevailed against charges of misconduct, was typical. Presumably the appellants were substantially innocent, for the charges against them were not sustained. Rather than address substantial innocence, the Board declared that the employer could not be said to have known that its case would fail. There were statements supporting the charges; disposition of the charges depended on resolution of credibility issues. Reasoning that there was some basis for the agency action and that the agency acted in good faith, the Board denied fees. The implication was that a person could be substantially innocent yet be denied fees because the agency acted in good faith. This was essentially abandonment of the "substantial innocence" test, a result probably reached because of the Board's fear that if those who are substantially innocent are awarded fees, being a prevailing party may in some cases ring up a fee award. To avoid allowing prevailing party status to determine fee entitlement, the Board avoided objective substantial innocence determinations, favoring instead subjective impressions of agency motivation leading to actions against employees.</p>
