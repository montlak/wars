<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-41"><span class="space">6.</span> Penalty Determination</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">After passage of the Reform Act, courts adopted the principle that a reviewing court normally defers to the administrative judgment on the appropriate corrective action. The reviewing court may not defer if the severity of the corrective action appears totally unwarranted in light of the range of permissible punishments specified by statute or regulation, the disciplined party's job level and nature, his record of past performance, the connection between his job and the improper conduct charged, and the strength of the proof that the conduct occurred. <span class="Italic">Rotolo v. MSPB</span>, 636 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Dept. of Army</span> (5th Cir. 1981 NP No. 80-7952). Other courts parrot the language of the Act, stating that they will not set aside an agency action unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 USC 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Otherson v. DOJ</span>, 711 F.2d 267 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Debose v. USDA</span>, 700 F.2d 1262 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Cleland</span> (5th Cir. 1981 NP No. 80-7440). The Court of Claims adopted the "harsh and disproportionate" standard in <span class="Italic">Moten v. USPS</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 796 (1982) (citing <span class="Italic">Brewer v. USPS</span>, 647 F.2d 1093 (Ct. Cl. 1981)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vestal v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210614109">1 F.4th 1049</a>, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 2021), summed up the Federal Circuit's view of its ability to review penalty determinations imposed by agencies and affirmed by MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not disturb an agency-imposed penalty merely because we might have chosen a lesser penalty had we been in charge. <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("Whether this court would have chosen a different penalty is irrelevant."); <span class="Italic">Graybill v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 782 F.2d 1567, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("In reviewing the appropriateness of an agency-imposed penalty, this Court does not sit as a final arbiter of disputes between the government and its employees. Our function is not to conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of agency disciplinary proceedings in order to determine what penalty we might have imposed....[T]he agency need not demonstrate that the particular penalty which it has imposed is the least severe penalty which can be imposed to effect the desired result." (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">Weston v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urb. Dev</span>., 724 F.2d 943, 949 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("In reviewing the appropriateness of an agency-imposed removal, it is not the place of this court to determine what course would have been pursued were we in charge."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("In exercising this limited scope of review, we do not consider how we would have decided the case in the first instance, and may not merely substitute our judgment for that of the board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, "[i]t is well established that the determination of the proper disciplinary action to be taken to promote the efficiency of the service is a matter peculiarly and necessarily within the discretion of the agency." <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also Guise v. Dep't of Just</span>., 330 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harding next contends that the penalty of removal for "a single, isolated, off-duty incident" is "unconscionably beyond the bounds of reasonableness." We regard the penalty as quite harsh in light of Ms. Harding's 24 years of service with the USNA and the absence of any prior disciplinary actions in her record. In view of the extremely limited scope of our review of penalty determinations, however, we uphold the penalty assessed in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The task of selecting a penalty rests primarily with the employing agency.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the penalty of removal was among the permissible penalties set forth in the USNA's table of penalties for unlawful use of illegal drugs on or off duty. Moreover, the conduct in question involved not only the use of drugs, but also driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in a residential Naval facility, conduct that the deciding official considered to have potentially endangered residents in the area. Although the arbitrator concluded that the penalty of removal was "at the outer extreme of the range of penalties," he concluded that it was "within the tolerable bounds of reasonableness." Applying the restrictive standard applicable to our review of the arbitrator's decision, we hold that the penalty is not outrageously disproportionate to the offense or totally unwarranted, and we therefore uphold the penalty selected by the deciding official.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Courts other than the Federal Circuit may provide a different analysis of deference, but deference to agency penalty determinations is still the norm. In <span class="Italic">Parsons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 707 F.2d 1406 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court reviewed the role of the Board in penalty determinations and mitigation. Recognizing that in Board appeals, agencies have to establish that the penalty imposed has been appropriately chosen for the specific misconduct involved, the court decided that the Board, in turn, must review the agency's penalty selection to be satisfied that: on the charges substantiated by the Board, the agency's penalty is within the range allowed by law, regulation, and any applicable table of penalties; and the penalty was based on a consideration of relevant <span id="Page_5209"></span>factors and a clear error of judgment has not occurred. The agency's burden, assuming no specific challenge to the propriety of the penalty during the Board adjudication, is to at least establish that it gave the necessary consideration to relevant factors in deciding that the penalty was appropriate and did not clearly exceed the limits of reasonableness. Although the agency decision notice need not contain information explicitly showing that the agency considered all possible mitigating factors before concluding that a lesser penalty would be inadequate, an agency's selection of a particular penalty must still be demonstrably based on a responsible balancing of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are limits to deference. If the court finds that a penalty seems extreme, it may inject its own analysis of mitigation, reversing and remanding for reconsideration of a penalty. This can occur if it appears that the Board did not give enough consideration to a long and excellent record of performance, and if the agency did not adequately consider the probability that the imposition of a lesser penalty would promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Gleason v.

Cir. 2005), and judicial review of an arbitrator's decision is under the same standard governing appeals of MSPB decisions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f); <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 774 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Thus the arbitrator's action is affirmed unless it is (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed, or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703c.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When taking adverse action against a federal employee, the agency must establish (1) that a preponderance of the evidence supports the charged misconduct, (2) a sufficient nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service, and (3) that the penalty imposed is reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">Malloy v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 578 F.3d 1351, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2009). In reviewing an agency's action, "[a]n arbitrator is bound to apply the same substantive legal standards as would the Merit Systems Protection Board ('MSPB')," <span class="Italic">Martin v.

<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Mayberry argues that agency rule requires progressive discipline and an opportunity to change, and that the penalty of immediate termination, in light of his highly favorable and lengthy record and commendations, is so disproportionate as to be an abuse of discretion. "[T]he discipline imposed by an agency will not be upheld where that discipline is so harsh that it is unconscionably disproportionate to the offense and amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Swentek v. United States</span>, 658 F.2d 791, 796 (Ct. Cl. 1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There must be a reasonable relationship between an employee's wrongdoing and the discipline imposed. In <span class="Italic">Villela v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 727 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1984), this court recognized that while "[t]he choice of penalty is generally left to agency discretion," deference is unwarranted if "the penalty is so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." In <span class="Italic">Webster v. Department of the Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the court observed that a "grossly disproportionate" remedy should not be sustained. In <span class="Italic">Mitchum v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 756 F.2d 82, 84 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court recognized a duty to ensure that "the agency has responsibly balanced the relevant factors in the individual case and selected a penalty within the tolerable limits of reasonableness." In <span class="Italic">Gose v. United States Postal Service</span>, 451 F.3d 831, 836 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the court explained that an abuse of discretion occurs where the decision "represents an unreasonable judgment in weighing relevant factors."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to the record, the arbitrator sustained the termination on the basis of Mr. Mayberry's admission that he physically "repositioned" four slouching, uncooperative students in the current school year. Although the school apparently referred to additional disciplinary actions that it said had occurred over two years, the arbitrator did not mention them. As stated in <span class="Italic">Quinton v. Department of Transportation</span>, 808 F.2d 826, 829 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the court "will scrutinize carefully the appropriateness of the penalty imposed" if "many of the original charges are not sustained below."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The arbitrator held that Mr. Mayberry's admitted repositioning of four unruly students in his first grade classroom warranted discharge, even though this was Mr. Mayberry's first complaint in twenty-seven years. As noted <span class="Italic">supra</span>, many parents, students, and colleagues provided letters and testimony on his behalf, stating that they consider him a wonderful teacher and an asset to the school. The school's policy and the collective bargaining agreement require progressive discipline if rehabilitation is feasible. However, the DoDEA regulations state that, "[u]sing physical force to alter the behavior of a student" may result in removal, even for a first offense. DoDEA regulations reflect the understanding that "[t]here are many disciplinary situations and a wide variety of penalties. In deciding which action to take, careful judgment must be used so that the penalty is not out of proportion to the character of the offense, especially a first offense." What Mr. Mayberry did, physically sitting-up students in their chairs and moving an unruly student sitting on the floor, is indeed a use of physical force, but the nature of the force and the entirety of the circumstances must be considered. It is not disputed that there was no notice to Mr. Mayberry that his actions were unacceptable, and no opportunity for him to cease this behavior. <span class="Italic">See Swentek</span>, 658 F.2d at 796 (discussing reasonableness of the penalty in light of all the circumstances).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We do not doubt that some offenses warrant immediate discharge; however, the arbitrator's examples of "slugging a supervisor" or "selling drugs" are not comparable. On the arbitrator's findings, Mr. Mayberry was fired for physically repositioning several disruptive students, when they would not follow his instructions to sit in their chairs or stop talking.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We do not hold that the school should not have intervened promptly, on learning of behavior that it deemed improper. However, on the facts on which the arbitrator relied, the remedy of termination, without prior notice of disapproval and without opportunity to improve, was not reasonable in view of the weighty record of glowing statements from many parents and students, and a history of commendations for excellence. The termination is reversed. We remand to the agency with instructions to withdraw the termination, and to provide sufficient instruction as to acceptable classroom discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To show a penalty is unreasonable under the theory that a lesser penalty would have sufficed, it is necessary to show that the lesser penalty would have promoted agency efficiency so significantly as to place removal outside the realm of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Franklin v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-632); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chin v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3176) ("[T]his court will not disturb an agency's choice of penalty unless the penalty is grossly disproportionate to the offense."); <span class="Italic">Roy v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 93-3407) ("That a lesser penalty might have been appropriate does not suffice. On appeal we cannot overturn the penalty selected by the agency unless it is 'grossly disproportionate' to the offense."); <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dept. of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (noting a "highly deferential" judicial regard for the agency penalty decision). At a minimum, penalty determinations must be reasoned. The Federal Circuit has determined that a penalty set by an arbitrator, e.g., reinstatement without back pay, is too harsh and on its own mitigated the penalty to a 60-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Lovato v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3152).</p>
