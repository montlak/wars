<p class="Body-Text">Although a retirement decision is presumed to be voluntary, voluntariness is negated if the agency threatens to take an adverse action without an arguable basis of support. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smart v. MSPB</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 595, 598 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006)), determined that a strong showing is required to establish impropriety when the agency is only considering disciplinary action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Dorrall urges that the agency improperly sought to impose a ten-day suspension on him based on an unsubstantiated charge. In light of his excellent work performance and no prior history of disciplinary action in his entire career with the Army, Dorrall contends that his supervisors improperly considered disciplining him for alleged infractions of "refusal to testify, interference or obstruction of an investigation" and "deliberate misrepresentation, exaggeration, concealment, withholding of a material fact, including lying to a supervisor" and that these unsubstantiated charges forced him to retire. This is not a case in which disciplinary action was formally commenced. A particularly strong showing is required to establish impropriety where the agency is only <span class="Italic">considering</span> disciplinary action. Dorrall has provided no evidence showing that consideration of disciplinary action was baseless. Circumstantial evidence supporting the agency decision includes Dorrall's request for leave after the August 3 hearing was set, and his cancellation of his leave request for August 3 shortly after the parties signed a settlement agreement resolving his first EEO complaint. Moreover, as Dorrall acknowledges in his brief, "Cornett drafted an alleged contemporaneous note indicating that Petitioner told him that he did not need the August 3, 2000 leave because he had reached a settlement." Notably, Dorrall failed to submit an affidavit contradicting Cornett's version of the conversation. Although the charges may or may not have been proven had Rittenhouse or Cornett elected to initiate them, at least in so far as the discipline was based on deliberate misrepresentation, the circumstantial evidence here is sufficient so that we conclude that Dorrall did not establish a complete lack of support for <span class="Italic">considering</span> a charge. Accordingly, Dorrall has failed to make a non-frivolous showing that the agency acted improperly based on an unsubstantiated charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Dorrall contends that Rittenhouse, one of his supervisors, retaliated against him by considering suspending him for ten days because he filed an EEO charge against her. As with item "first," since discipline was only considered and not initiated, a heightened showing of improper purpose is required. This showing has not been made here. The evidence that Dorrall provides in support of his retaliation claim includes: (1) Rittenhouse's testimony that she felt as if he had gone behind her back in filing the claim without speaking to her first; (2) Rittenhouse's testimony that if he wanted his job back (after his resignation), then she would have worked with the department to determine where he would work because it would have been a hardship on both of them for him to remain in the division; (3) Mill's testimony that Dorrall should be disciplined in connection with the leave incident and that she had never dealt with anyone so arrogant and uncooperative; and (4) his own testimony that management wanted him out of the agency. However, none of this evidence establishes that Dorrall's supervisors contemplated action <span class="Italic">because of</span> hostility toward Dorrall based on his EEO complaint. Dorrall's own conclusory testimony speculating about the link to the proposed disciplinary action is hardly sufficient to establish an improper motive. Therefore, we conclude that Dorrall has failed to support a non-frivolous allegation that the agency acted improperly against him because of his EEO claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Dorrall contends that management created a hostile work environment that left him with no choice but to retire. He further contends that the proposed ten-day suspension would have negatively affected his career in the Army, led to a financial loss of wages and benefits, and threatened his mental health. To support this allegation, Dorrall points to the events of the August 2 meeting when Rittenhouse questioned him in a raised tone of voice about ordering the most expensive item on the menu for his birthday luncheon, requesting reimbursement on a one <span id="Page_1995"></span>dollar error in a travel voucher, and with respect to his filing a workers' compensation claim, whether there were any witnesses to his accident. However, these events are insufficient to support a non-frivolous allegation. "As this court has explained, the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary." <span class="Italic">Staats,</span> 99 F.3d at 1124 (citations omitted). We conclude that Dorrall has not supported a non-frivolous allegation that he was faced with a hostile work environment that forced him to retire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">San Nicolas v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-09-0948-I-1 (NP 11/24/2010), considered unpersuasive the appellant's allegation that he was forced to retire by an agency's unwarranted allegations of misconduct and the threat of the agency to refer misconduct allegations to its inspector general (with possible further referral to a U.S. Attorney for consideration of criminal charges) if the appellant withdrew from an agreement to retire:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired from the U.S. Postal Service following an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) which concluded that the appellant had engaged in misconduct for which the OIG believed the U.S. Attorney should be notified and disciplinary action should be considered. The appellant filed an initial appeal with the Board asserting that his retirement was involuntary. In her initial decision, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant had failed to meet his burden to prove coercion, and that as a result, the Board lacked jurisdiction over his retirement action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's petition for review does not contain any new evidence, but asserts that his retirement was coerced because: (1) that the agency threatened to charge him falsification even though they allegedly knew they could not prove any intent to deceive; and (2) the agency threatened criminal prosecution....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant is correct that the agency could not prove falsification, his argument still fails because the appellant has not provided any evidence to establish that the agency would have used the word falsification or any derivation of that word. The agency could have framed the charge in any number of ways not involving intent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Benoist v. Department of Defense</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 418, 424-25 (1989) (holding that charging an appellant with a failure to provide accurate information is not the same as charging an appellant with falsification); <span class="Italic">Butler v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (holding that specific intent is not an aspect of a charge of failure to provide accurate information on official documents).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency had a signed admission under oath from the appellant that he knowingly permitted inaccurate time cards, with the result that the Postal Service lost funds. In a signed letter to his supervisor, the appellant admitted that 80 hours of his time was inaccurately recorded and should be credited back to the Postal Service. The agency therefore had legitimate grounds to believe the efficiency of the service had been damaged, and that it would be proper to pursue an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the agency's warning that the U.S. Attorney would likely be notified if the appellant withdrew from the agreement, the Board has held that the fact that an appellant is faced with unpleasant choices, i.e., to face the possibility of criminal charges or to enter into an agreement to leave the service, does not affect the voluntariness of the appellant's ultimate decision to enter into the agreement. <span class="Italic">Souza v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 107, 110 (1992). The OIG concluded that it was appropriate to refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Guam. Mr. Ishizaki admits that he notified the appellant that if the appellant withdrew from their agreement, the OIG would have to be informed, which "could" lead to action by the U.S. Attorney's office. This case is analogous to <span class="Italic">Souza</span>, and leads us to the same conclusion. The retirement was not coerced, and therefore the Board lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To resolve whether an agency knew that the reason for a threatened removal could not be substantiated, the appellant must be permitted to present evidence challenging the merits and the legitimacy of the agency's proposed action. <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 245 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Laguerra v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DC-0752-12-0395-I-1 (NP 5/23/2013) ("If, however, an appellant shows that an agency knew that it would not prevail on a proposed adverse action, the proposed action is coercive and the resulting retirement is involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The Board has held that an appellant must do more than merely rebut the agency's reasons for the threatened action. <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 245, 251 (1988)."); <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-0752-12-0069-I-1 (NP 9/27/2012) ("Further, even though the appellant appears to assert that the agency coerced him into retiring by proposing a 5-day suspension, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant has made no attempt to show that the agency knew that the allegations against him could not be substantiated."); <span class="Italic">cf. Halterman v. USDA</span>, DC-0752-17-0081-I-1 (NP 1/26/2023) ("The fact that the appellant has a defense--that may or may not be successful--against the agency's allegations of misconduct is insuffi cient to establish that the agency knew or should have known that its allegations could not be substantiated. <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 245, 251 (1988) (explaining that, to show that the agency knew or should have known that its action could not be substantiated, the appellant must do more than merely rebut the agency's reasons for the action)....The appellant has not shown that the agency knew that there was no factual basis for its charges, and, assuming the charges were sustained, removal would be within the bounds of reasonableness for an employee with such an extensive disciplinary record.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decisions are not consistent on the threshold level of pleading to secure a hearing on an allegedly coerced retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 44 MSPR 537, 541 (1990) ("[T]he record reflects that the appellant was free to choose his course of action, understood the options, and had ample time to make a reasoned and informed decision to retire. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coving ton v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 941-42 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Wells v. Department of the Navy</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 293, 294 (1980).... The appellant must do more than merely rebut the agency's reasons for the removal action to show coercion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136. Thus, in the absence of a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency sought his retirement, exerted pressure on him to retire or misinformed or deceived him, there is no basis for a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1989).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether the agency had an arguable basis for the proposal that led the appellant to an arguably involuntary retirement is not to be summarily determined by the AJ--even when the agency enjoys the advantageous position of the evidentiary standards established under Chapter 43. <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 245, 251-52 (1988)<span class="Italic">,</span> noted, as to an AJ 's efforts to truncate the evidentiary examination in a challenge to a retirement allegedly compelled by the unwarranted threat of a performance-based action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the appellant's contentions to the contrary in the instant ease, the facts that he did not want to retire and that he was faced with the unpleasant alternative choices of either retiring or opposing the Chapter 43 separation action do not rebut the presumed voluntariness of his ultimate choice of retirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136; <span class="Italic">Christie,</span> 518 F.2d at 587-88; <span class="Italic">Musone v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 31 MSPR 85, 89 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 818 F.2d 876 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Myslik,</span> 2 MSPR at 71. However, if the appellant can show that the agency knew that the reasons for the proposed Chapter 43 action could not be substantiated, the proposed action would be purely coercive and would render his resulting retirement involuntary, his appeal within the Board's jurisdiction, and entitle him to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">E.g., Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136; <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 34 MSPR 225 note (1987). In this connection, we note that to make this showing the appellant must do more than merely rebut the agency reasons for the separation action. <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the agency lacked a reasonable basis for proposing his separation for alleged unacceptable performance and that the agency must have been aware of that fact. At the hearing, the administrative judge permitted the appellant to testify concerning only one specification of the agency's charges of unacceptable performance. The administrative judge then sustained the agency's objection to further testimony concerning the merits of the agency's separation action or of the appellant's performance appraisal. Thereafter, the administrative judge found that there was an arguable basis for the agency's proposed Chapter 43 action and that the appellant did not show that the agency knew or should have known that its proposed action could not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the administrative judge erred by precluding the appellant from presenting evidence challenging the merits and legitimacy of the agency's proposed Chapter 43 action in an attempt to show that his retirement was the product of agency duress in proposing his separation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 26 MSPR 244, 246 (1985) (an employee may show that his retirement due to a proposed reassignment was involuntary if he demonstrates that the reassignment was not based on a legitimate management reason and was intended to coerce his retirement or was an arbitrary and capricious adverse action). The administrative judge failed to permit the appellant to testify and to examine his immediate supervisor, who testified on the issue of Board jurisdiction. This was error. The supervisor was the rating official for the appellant's performance appraisal and the proposing official in the separation action. The appellant should have been afforded the opportunity to examine the supervisor concerning not only the alleged lack of merit, but also the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the appellant's performance rating and of the proposed Chapter 43 action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's denial of this inquiry improperly deprived the appellant of the opportunity to rebut the agency's asserted basis for the proposed separation action in support of his ultimate burden to demonstrate that the agency knew or should have known when it proposed that action that it could not prevail, and that his resulting retirement was thus involuntary and appealable to the Board. The Board therefore finds that the appellant must be afforded the opportunity to submit evidence, including testimony, in support of his allegation that the agency's proposed separation action constituted an improper <span id="Page_1996"></span>coercive action resulting in his involuntary retirement. <span class="Italic">See Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d 1133 at 1136, and <span class="Italic">Rayfield,</span> 26 MSPR at 247.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 107 MSPR 466, 470-71 &#x00B6; 13, 2007 MSPB 304 (2007) (allegations, among others, that the agency threatened removal without adequate cause were sufficient to take the appeal from a retirement to a hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Locke v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 283, 287-88 (1994), the appellant was entitled to proceed with both discovery and a hearing on his claim that the agency forced his retirement through unwarranted accusations of misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacks jurisdiction over a challenge to a voluntary separation from the federal service. <span class="Italic">West v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 MSPR 551, 561 (1990). Although an employee's decision to resign or to retire is presumed to have been voluntarily made, <span class="Italic">id</span>., the employee can rebut this presumption by showing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his resignation or retirement was "obtained by agency misrepresentation or deception," <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In addition, although a resignation or retirement is not considered involuntary merely because an employee chose to resign or to retire in the face of an agency's threat to remove him for cause, an agency must nonetheless have had "reasonable grounds for threatening to take an adverse action." <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). If an employee can demonstrate that "the agency knew that the reason for [a] threatened removal could not be substantiated, the threatened action by the agency is purely coercive." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that, contrary to Provencio's statements, the agency did not possess evidence from reliable sources on November 18, 1992, showing that he had engaged in misconduct serious enough to warrant his removal. His allegations are nonfrivolous because, if he proves them, he will have made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that his retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Cf. Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1135-36 (an employee's resignation, tendered in response to her supervisor's statement that her excessive absences were sufficient reason "for disciplinary action up to removal," was deemed involuntary because the agency's "threat of an adverse action could not be substantiated").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prevail on a claim of involuntary retirement based on an agency's misrepresentation, the employee must have reasonably relied on the agency's statements<span class="Italic">. Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1575. The administrative judge appears to have concluded that it was unreasonable for the appellant to have taken any action based on his November 18, 1992 conversation with Provencio, since at that time the allegations against him "had not been confirmed or discredited." The relevant inquiry, though, is whether it was reasonable for the appellant to choose early retirement while he still had the chance to do so, rather than face the possibility of having to defend against a removal action based on what an agency official claimed was "reliable" evidence of misconduct. The appellant was not required to wait until the agency brought a removal action against him in order to preserve a claim of involuntary retirement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1135-36.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sufficient evidence existed to negate a claim that the agency knew or should have known that a demotion could not be substantiated in <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. MSPB</span>, 646 Fed. Appx. 980, 983 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Ms. Nguyen contends that her retirement was coerced because the agency knew or should have known that her demotion action could not be substantiated. In <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, we found that if an "employee can show that the agency knew that the reason for the threatened removal" cannot "be substantiated, the threatened action by the agency is purely coercive" and thus facially voluntary acts resulting from the threatened removal may be involuntary. 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Ms. Nguyen did not make this argument before the Board, and therefore it is waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 4 n.3 ("Although the appellant alleges she has engaged in no wrongdoing, she has not contended that the agency knew or should have known that its demotion action could not be substantiated or that the agency lacked an arguable basis for the proposed action."); <span class="Italic">Elmore v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 421 F.3d 1339, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In any event, Ms. Nguyen has not sufficiently alleged even on review that the reduction in grade could not be substantiated. The notice of a proposed reduction in grade cited two specific incidents where Ms. Nguyen allegedly sought to have her son transferred rather than being fired. These allegations were supported by statements from the two directors involved. Ms. Nguyen has not sufficiently alleged that the agency knew, or should have known, that there was no "viable basis" to support her reduction in grade. If Ms. Nguyen concluded the agency's position was unsupported, her remedy was to appeal the reduction in grade to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not readily credit claims that an agency forced a retirement through a potential adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Denson v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-14-0671-I-1 (NP 4/3/2015) ("To the extent that she believed that she would be subject to future disciplinary action as a result of the PIP, there is no evidence that such an action was planned, and an employee's anticipation of an adverse action does not constitute coercion or duress on the part of an agency.... We find that the appellant's argument regarding the agency's official directive letter does not nonfrivolously allege intolerable working conditions because the letter contemplates future actions, such as being charged with AWOL and subject to disciplinary action, which she could have contested if and when they occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15.
