<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-80"><span id="Page_2952"></span><span class="space">b.</span> Conversion of Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion an agency may initiate action under Chapter 43, e.g., with a PIP and a Chapter 43 proposal to remove or demote, think the better of it, and convert the case to Chapter 75. The agency may seek a conversion of the action before the Board hearing. The evolution of the approach is traced below, and the outer limits of conversion discretion are unclear. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-290.html#sec8-288">Performance</a>," for Chapter 75 performance-based actions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 592, 603 (1984), the agency lost its Chapter 43 case for lack of a proper performance standard. The Board rejected the contention that the action should be considered under Chapter 75:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Section] 7512(d) of Chapter 75 precludes the application of Chapter 75 to any action brought pursuant to an OPM-approved performance appraisal system. Even in the absence of statutory preclusion, allowing conversion to Chapter 75 would be unfair in general to the appellant involved. Because the proof and defenses are different for Chapter 43 and Chapter 75 actions, it would be tantamount to permitting the agency to change charges after failing to prove its initial ones. Therefore, it would deprive the appellant of the right to respond to the specific charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Allowing conversion to Chapter 75 would also be improper under the circumstances of this case. As stated above, the establishment of valid performance standards is an important substantive right of an employee under Chapter 43. There is no comparable provision requiring the establishment of valid performance standards for the long-term measurement of performance under Chapter 75....&#8197;Moreover, if the agency had established a valid performance standard under Chapter 43, appellant might have met the standard and no action would have been brought. To allow the agency to proceed with a Chapter 75 action is to subject appellant to an adverse action, where, but for the agency's failings, there might have been no action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we hold that an action for "unacceptable performance" brought under &#x00A7; 4303, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, under an OPM-approved performance appraisal plan, cannot be converted to a Chapter 75 action after the Board determines that the agency has established a performance standard that violates 5 USC &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Callaway</span> was decided on PFR after the agency lost its Chapter 43 case on the basis of an invalid standard. The agency did not initiate the case under both Chapters 43 and 75, and it does not appear that the agency tried to convert the action to Chapter 43 during the hearing. Also, <span class="Italic">Callaway</span> was decided when the subsequently overruled decision of <span class="Italic">Gende v. DOJ,</span> 23 MSPR 604 (1984), made Chapter 43 the exclusive remedy for performance-based actions. <span class="Italic">Gende</span> was overruled in <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Later decisions determined that if the appeal has proceeded through the completion of the Board hearing under Chapter 43, the agency may not try to reinvigorate its case by requesting that it be considered under Chapter 75. Although the court left open the question of whether, having lost the Chapter 43 case, the agency could bring a whole separate case under Chapter 75, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 770 F.2d 1048 (Fed. Cir. 1985), refused to remand a case that failed under Chapter 43 for redetermination under Chapter 75, noting that the government was seeking to change the nature of the proceeding after the fact. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shorey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 77 MSPR 239, 244 (1998) (agency may not process an action under Chapter 43 and then change the theory of the case to Chapter 75 after the hearing, upon determining that it did not comply with all Chapter 43 requirements); <span class="Italic">Freeman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 19 MSPR 489, 491 (1984) (among other factors, the agency did not raise pursuit of the action under Chapter 75 at any time during the proceedings before the regional office). [Refer to decisions discussed in Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-034.html#sec11-35">Double Jeopardy</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit seemed to confirm the notion of election of "remedies" when it qualified <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> by determining that if an action is taken against an employee under Chapter 43 and adjudicated through the Board hearing on that basis, the Board errs by deciding the case after the hearing under Chapter 75. Said the court in <span class="Italic">Hanratty v. FAA</span>, 780 F.2d 33, 35 (Fed. Cir. 1985), resulting in a remand ordering reconsideration through a properly conducted Chapter 75 proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may not simply substitute Chapter 75 for Chapter 43 or vice versa after the parties have presented their evidence. Whether doing so would favor the petitioner or the agency cannot be controlling, after-the-fact switches being inherently unfair and governing considerations under the two chapters being distinct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...The employee's defense necessarily differs in proceedings under Chapter 75 from that in proceedings under Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">James v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 124, 127 (1985), involving a case that was unsuccessful under Chapter 43 for failure of proof of unsuccessful performance during a PIP, determined that the removal could not be sustained under a Chapter 75 approach due to performance deficiencies that led to the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we also reject the agency's contention that since it might not have been required to place appellant on a PIP, it should not be precluded from doing now what it could have done initially, notwithstanding appellant's satisfactory performance during the improvement period, We find that when an agency elects to proceed under Chapter 43, it is bound by the Chapter 43 requirements. <span class="Italic">See generally Home v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 684 F.2d 155 (1982), <span class="Italic">citing SEC v. Chenery,</span> 322 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the Federal Circuit's 1985 <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span> the court declined to permit reconsideration of a case under Chapter 75 standards after the appeal was concluded before the Board under Chapter 43. The Board adopted the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> result in <span class="Italic">Kopp v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 624, 628 (1987), barring reconsideration of an action under Chapter 75 when it was unsuccessfully prosecuted before the Board under Chapter 43:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Having lost on the issue of its Chapter 43 compliance, the agency is now attempting to rely upon another statute in order to obtain a favorable decision. The time for making an argument that the action had been taken under Chapter 75, however, has long passed. An agency cannot, when the case is before the Board, change its performance-based action from a Chapter 43 action to a Chapter 75 action. <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Department of the Army,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 592 (1984). The Federal Circuit has recently held that, notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Lovshin,</span> the Board's denial of such a requested change is proper. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 770 F.2d 1048, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Nor can the Board, on its own, initiative, substitute Chapter 75 for Chapter 43 as the basis for the agency action. <span class="Italic">Hanratty v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 780 F.2d 33, 35 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Therefore, the finding of the administrative judge that the agency was taken under Chapter 43 is correct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concluding that a Chapter 43 action may not be converted during the hearing to a Chapter 75 action, <span class="Italic">Coltrane v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 6, 9-10 (1986), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency effected the instant reduction in grade action under the procedures of Chapter 43. At the hearing, the agency first attempted to argue in the alternative that the performance-based action could also be sustained as an adverse action under Chapter 75 procedures. The administrative judge, however, declined to permit the agency to show alternatively that its Chapter 43 action should be sustained under Chapter 75 procedures....&#8197;Subsequent to our final decision on the merits in this case, the court determined in <span class="Italic">Lovshin, supra,</span> that Chapter 75 may be used to remove or demote an employee for performance-based reasons as long as the agency meets the burdens of that Chapter. Thus, the agency could have elected initially to process its action against appellant under Chapter 75 procedures. The court and the Board, however, have determined that if an agency action effected under Chapter 43 is found to be defective, the action may not then be converted before the Board to a Chapter 75 action. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 770 F.2d 1048, 1054-55 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Department of the Army,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 592, 602-03 (1984). Thus, the administrative judge did not err in declining to consider this Chapter 43 case in the alternative under Chapter 75 procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Marine Corps</span>, 37 MSPR 359, 362-63 (1988), followed. Mr. Ortiz was removed based on charges of unsatisfactory performance under Chapter 43, absences, insubordination, and threatening a supervisor. The AJ found that the performance charge failed because the appellant was not provided an opportunity period. Removal was mitigated to suspension. During the prehearing conference, the AJ denied the agency the opportunity to show that the performance charge was sustainable under Chapter 75. Noting that the Federal Circuit overruled the Board's 1984 <span class="Italic">Gende</span> decision by the court's 1985 <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> decision, the Board resolved in <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> that a prehearing conversion from Chapter 43 to Chapter 75 is permissible because it "does not deprive the appellant of due process because he has the opportunity to either <span id="Page_2953"></span>respond by presenting evidence and argument on the Chapter 75 issues in question, or to request a continuance to prepare such a response":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Board and the Federal Circuit have held that conversions made after the close of the record are improper. In <span class="Italic">Kopp v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 33 MSPR 624, 628 (1987), the Board held that an agency could not first assert that a performance-based action taken under Chapter 43 should also be considered under Chapter 75 after a petition for review had been filed. Citing <span class="Italic">Callaway,</span> the Board stated that having lost on the issue of Chapter 43 compliance, the agency could not belatedly try to rely upon another statute in order to obtain a favorable decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hanratty v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 780 F.2d 33, 35 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal Circuit also found that after-the-fact switches are inherently unfair, and concluded that the Board may not unilaterally convert a Chapter 43 action to a Chapter 75 action after a hearing had been held and the record had been closed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1054-55 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (court denied the agency's after-the-fact request for consideration of performance-based action under Chapter 75 via remand to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case, however, is distinguishable from these cases because the agency here requested that the charge be considered under Chapter 75 prior to the hearing. Thus, the present case does not present a situation where the agency has lost on the issue and is belatedly trying to prove its charges on another legal basis. Further, allowing the agency to request consideration under Chapter 75 prior to the hearing does not deprive the appellant of due process because he has the opportunity to either respond by presenting evidence and argument on the Chapter 75 issues in question, or to request a continuance to prepare such a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Hanratty</span> and <span class="Italic">Kochanny v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,</span> 694 F.2d 698 (Fed. Cir. 1982), support allowing prehearing conversions. In <span class="Italic">Hanratty,</span> the court noted that the case had been consistently treated as arising under Chapter 43 until the administrative judge converted the case to Chapter 75 after the hearing concluded. 780 F.2d at 34-35. Rather than directing the Board to reconsider the case under Chapter 43, however, the court relied on <span class="Italic">Kochanny</span> and held that the agency should be given the opportunity to show that the procedures and action it took conformed to the requirements of Chapter 75, and that the appellant be given a chance to present any defenses he might have in a properly conducted Chapter 75 proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 35-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kochanny</span>, the court found that there was no basis for concluding that an agency must be held to an irrevocable election between Chapters 43 and 75, and that an appellant's loss of Chapter 43 defenses does not amount to a denial of due process. 694 F.2d at 702. The court held that the determinative consideration is whether, from beginning to end, the agency afforded the appellant all of his rights under the chapter on which the removal action was sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also found that the Board's allowing the agency to convert to Chapter 75 did not violate the appellant's procedural rights because, rather than allowing the agency to reinstitute proceedings or alter the basic grounds underlying its action against the appellant, the agency was only given the opportunity to show that the procedures and action it had used conformed to the requirements of Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">There was the comment in <span class="Italic">Kopp v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 624, 628 (1987): "An agency cannot, when the case is before the Board, change its performance-based action from a Chapter 43 action to a Chapter 75 action. <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Department of the Army,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 592 (1984)." <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">Kopp</span> at 362 n.3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that <span class="Italic">Kopp</span> supports his conclusion that the agency could not convert from Chapter 43 to Chapter 75 prior to the hearing. The facts in <span class="Italic">Kopp</span>, however, distinguish it from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Kopp</span>, the agency first raised the conversion issue after the record was closed and a petition for review had been filed. 33 M.S.P.R. at 626-27. In the present case, the agency sought pre-hearing conversion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Andrade v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 1 MSPR 709, 711 (1980) ("Notice to the employees of the proposed action under Chapter 43 adequately met the notification requirements of Chapter 75. Initial invocation...of the incorrect chapter of the U.S. Code has not been shown...to have been harmful error.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board blessed prehearing conversions of cases from Chapter 43 to Chapter 75, and also blessed an implied mitigation analysis required under Chapter 75 but not required under Chapter 43, in <span class="Italic">Miller v. GSA,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BORNINKHOF_SF075209008_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253363.pdf">SF-0752-12-0189-I-1</a> (NP 8/29/2013), over the dissent of Vice Chairman Wagner, who offered the better analysis. The majority and dissenting opinions are provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 14, 2011, the agency placed the appellant on a 60-day performance improvement plan (PIP). Thereafter, based on his unacceptable performance during the PIP, the agency removed the appellant from his competitive service position as an Appraiser, GS-13, effective December 12, 2011, for "unsatisfactory performance." While the agency effected the appellant's removal under chapter 43, the administrative judge later properly granted the agency's request to convert the removal to an action taken under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 359, 361-63 (1988) (if a hearing has not yet occurred, an agency may convert an unsustainable chapter 43 action to a chapter 75 action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant contends that the penalty of removal was beyond the bounds of reasonableness, arguing that "his lengthy Federal Service and his ability to be rehabilitated should have been considered as mitigating factors to reduce the penalty" to demotion or suspension. Although we agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official did not explicitly conduct a chapter 75-style penalty analysis in this case, we do not agree with his suggestion that the deciding official failed to consider the relevant penalty factors, including the ones that the appellant mentions on petition for review.[4] In his decision letter, the deciding official acknowledged the appellant's lengthy federal service, his difficult personal circumstances, and his assertions that he could be a productive employee in the future. The deciding official considered these matters and explained why he nevertheless believed that removal, rather than demotion, was the appropriate penalty. The penalty explanation in the decision letter is consistent with the deciding official's testimony. He explained that the appellant had adequate opportunity to improve his performance yet utterly failed his PIP, that the appellant took no personal accountability for his performance deficiencies, and the appellant did not demonstrate the qualities needed for successful performance in either of the positions that he requested in lieu of removal. With respect to other performance-based actions that he had decided in the past, the deciding official testified that he imposed lesser penalties only when the employees had not failed their PIPs so completely and, unlike the appellant, took accountability for their actions. For these reasons, we find that the deciding official considered all the relevant penalty factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The administrative judge correctly noted that a chapter 75 penalty analysis is not usually necessary in a chapter 43 action because the Board lacks the authority to review an agency's penalty determination under chapter 43. Nevertheless, an agency has penalty options under chapter 43 as well. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(a). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that, even in a chapter 43 action, a deciding official will have reasons for selecting one penalty over another. The agency has proven this to be the case here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the dissent that the conversion of this appeal from chapter 43 to chapter 75 violated the appellant's due process rights. Specifically, we disagree that the agency failed to provide the appellant with its reasons for the adverse action. The proposal notice stated in detail the specific reasons for the removal, i.e., the appellant's performance deficiencies. The appellant responded to the notice both orally and in writing. The deciding official considered the appellant's responses and conducted a thoughtful penalty analysis, as reflected in both his decision letter and his hearing testimony. There is no indication that the deciding official's penalty determination was based on any sort of aggravating factors that the appellant could not reasonably have known would figure into the decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (the deciding official considered instances of misconduct not mentioned in the notice of proposed removal); <span class="Italic">Pickett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 439 (2011) (the deciding official considered information about an arrest and rumors about a domestic incident, neither of which were mentioned in the notice of proposed removal). Rather, the penalty determination was based solely on the appellant's performance failure and his refusal to take responsibility for it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent cites a number of cases that stand for the general proposition that an agency must notify an employee at the predecisional stage of the reasons for its action. We agree with this proposition, but, for the reasons explained above, we find that the appellant in this case did not lack any such notice. The dissent also explains that the Board must review an agency action based solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and may not substitute what it considers a more adequate or proper basis. Once again, we agree, but we find that this did not occur in this case. The Board has reviewed the agency's action based on a charge of inadequate performance--the same charge that the agency brought in its notice of proposed removal. We disagree that reviewing under chapter 75 an action that an agency took under its chapter 43 authority constitutes the substitution of a different ground for the same action. Rather, the Board is merely substituting a different standard of appellate review for the one that the agency contemplated when it first took the action, a standard which is in fact higher for the agency to meet. The Board and the Federal Circuit have both endorsed this approach, <span class="Italic">e.g., Kochanny v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, &#x0026; Firearms</span>, 694 F.2d 698 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 359, and we find no reason to depart from the binding precedent of our reviewing court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner dissented in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority affirms the administrative judge's finding that the agency was permitted to convert the basis of its removal action from one taken for performance under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 into a conduct-based action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 after the appellant filed his appeal to the Board. I respectfully dissent for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proposed the appellant's removal "for unacceptable performance" in three critical elements of his performance appraisal. The agency noted that the appellant had been placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP) to provide him with a formal, structured opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance in his critical elements over a period of not less than 60 days. The agency asserted that the appellant's performance in the three critical elements remained at Level 1 (unacceptable) and that the appellant consistently missed assigned deadlines, submitted deficient work products, and disregarded the requirement to maintain documentation and place documents on the shared M drive. The proposal notice did not indicate how the agency evaluated any of the factors required to be considered under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty of removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a written response to the proposal arguing that the supporting documentation was inaccurate and incomplete. The appellant explained in detail why each of the agency's findings of unacceptable performance was incorrect, but did not argue that there was no nexus between the unacceptable performance and the efficiency <span id="Page_2954"></span>of the service. Although he asserted that removal "[was] too severe of a decision" and asked for consideration of an option less than removal, the appellant did not otherwise challenge the penalty of removal or identify mitigating factors except for his length of service and unspecified medical conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official sustained the proposed removal upon finding that the appellant failed to raise his performance to an acceptable level during the performance improvement period. Specifically, he found that the appellant failed to perform acceptably in the critical elements of his position as set forth in the proposal notice. He rejected the appellant's contention that the appraisal review was vague or subjective. He further found that (1) the appellant consistently missed his production deadlines and failed to conform to the PIP requirements; (2) the PIP was long enough to afford him an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance; and (3) a reassignment would require the ability to initiate and perform a variety of complex duties without close supervision. However, the deciding official did not otherwise address the reasonableness of the penalty of removal. A Standard Form 50 indicated that the authority for the action was "Reg 432.101."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the administrative judge <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> issued an order noting that the PIP notice issued to the appellant was defective insofar as it did not inform him of the "Level 2" standard at which he could avoid removal, but instead erroneously informed him of the "Level 3" standard for "acceptable performance" and that "[f]ailure to achieve an acceptable performance level may result in your removal...." Indicating that it appeared that the agency's removal action could therefore not be sustained under chapter 43, the administrative judge directed the agency to show why the removal should not be reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded by asserting that its PIP <span class="Italic">did</span> provide the appellant with the correct notice of what he needed to achieve to avoid removal. Alternatively, citing <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 359 (1988), the agency requested that the case be converted to a chapter 75 appeal. The appellant asserted that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> and that the agency should be required to initiate a new removal action under chapter 75 if the chapter 43 action was reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the PIP notice recited "Level 3" performance requirements for each critical element and did not reference "Level 2" performance requirements. He further held that a reasonable person reading the PIP would conclude that acceptable performance meant Level 3 performance and that the word "acceptable" would not put a reasonable person on notice that he was only required to meet the Level 2 standards. Thus, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to specifically inform the appellant of the degree to which his performance would have to improve to avoid removal. The administrative judge further granted the agency's request for conversion of the appeal to chapter 75 because it was "timely in light of <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>," and because, under <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1985), agencies have the option of using chapter 75 to effect actions that are entirely or partially based on performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing, the administrative judge affirmed the removal action, finding that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant's performance was unacceptable with respect to all but one of the tasks set forth in the PIP and all of the applicable critical elements. He further found that the agency established a nexus between the sustained charge and the efficiency of the service. While acknowledging that the agency's decision letter was silent on the question of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the administrative judge concluded that the Board's role was to ensure that the penalty imposed was within the parameters of reasonableness. In this regard, he relied on the hearing testimony of the deciding official regarding (1) the impact of the appellant's deficiencies on the agency's mission; (2) the extent to which the appellant was on notice of what he was expected to accomplish during the PIP; (3) the fact that there were no other suitable positions in which the appellant could be placed; the appellant's lack of remorse; and (4) his belief that those factors outweighed the appellant's length of service. The administrative judge concluded that removal was within the bounds of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the agency improperly circumvented chapter 43. The agency has responded in opposition to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>, the Board held that "allowing the agency to request consideration under chapter 75 prior to the hearing does not deprive the appellant of due process because he has the opportunity to either respond by presenting evidence and argument on the chapter 75 issues in question, or to request a continuance to prepare such a response." 37 M.S.P.R. at 363. However, subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 680-81 (1991), the Board had occasion to apply <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), the seminal Supreme Court decision addressing minimal due process requirements when an agency removes an employee. In <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, the Board held that an adverse action taken without affording an appellant <span class="Italic">pre-deprivation</span> notice of the reasons for the action, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and a meaningful opportunity to respond, must be reversed because such action violates the constitutional right to due process as recognized in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>. Although <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> did not involve an agency's conversion of a chapter 43 action into a chapter 75 case, its holding with regard to a federal employee's constitutionally protected due process rights fundamentally undermines--if not implicitly overrules--<span class="Italic">Ortiz'</span> imprimatur of the <span class="Italic">post-deprivation</span> notice and opportunity to respond that necessarily occurs with a post appeal conversion of a chapter 43 performance-based action into a chapter 75 disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The original authority for converting performance-based actions under chapter 43 into adverse actions under chapter 75 is the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 208, 210-11 (1979), which declared invalid an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation permitting agencies to effect removals and demotions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 before establishing a performance appraisal system required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 247-48. In <span class="Italic">Wells</span>, the Board ordered agencies that did not have an approved performance appraisal system to cease taking all unsatisfactory performance actions under chapter 43 but observed that an agency may alternatively choose to pursue disciplinary action under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 249-50. The Board subsequently issued orders remanding a number of appeals for a new agency election on whether to proceed under chapter 75, finding that notice to the employees of the proposed action under chapter 43 adequately met the notification requirements of chapter 75 and that "[i]nitial invocation by the agency of the incorrect chapter of the U.S. Code has not been shown...to have been harmful error, since there has been no showing that application of chapter 75 would likely have affected the original agency decision." <span class="Italic">In re Andrade</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 709, 710-11 (1980). However, neither <span class="Italic">Wells</span> nor <span class="Italic">In re Andrade</span>, both of which were issued before <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, addressed the constitutional due process issues identified in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>. Rather, they analyzed the issue solely as one of harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 829, 843, the Federal Circuit also set forth the general principle that an agency may invoke either chapter 43 or chapter 75 as authority for removing an employee for performance-based reasons. However, <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> did not involve a conversion of a chapter 43 action into a chapter 75 action in an appeal already pending before the Board. Nor do the two Federal Circuit cases upon which the Board relied in <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> require that we find that such a practice comports with the minimal due process requirements recognized in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>. In <span class="Italic">Kochanny v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms</span>, 694 F.2d 698, 699-700 (Fed. Cir. 1982), the court generally adopted the Board's harmful error analysis in <span class="Italic">Wells</span>, but that decision predates <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> and does not address the constitutional due process implications of a post-appeal conversion of a chapter 43 to a chapter 75 action. Furthermore, in rejecting the appellant's argument that the Board violated his procedural rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, the court in <span class="Italic">Kochanny</span> explained that the Board's remand order "did not authorize the agency to reinstitute proceedings or to alter the basic grounds for its action against petitioner. Rather, the agency was given the opportunity to show that the procedures and action <span class="Italic">which had been taken</span> conformed to the requirements of chapter 75." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 702 (emphasis in original). Thus, the court in <span class="Italic">Kochanny</span> did not necessarily find that an unsatisfactory performance action taken under chapter 43 would necessarily meet the procedural requirements of chapter 75. Instead, it found that an agency should have the opportunity to show that the pre-deprivation procedures followed complied with chapter 75. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hanratty v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 780 F.2d 33, 34-35 (Fed. Cir. 1985), while finding that the Board may not unilaterally convert a chapter 43 case into a chapter 75 case after the hearing and close of record, the court followed <span class="Italic">Kochanny</span> and remedied the Board's error by allowing the agency an opportunity to show that the action was consistent with chapter 75 requirements. Although the decision was issued 9 months after <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the court did not take into account any of the constitutional due process concerns raised in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and later addressed in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>. Accordingly, neither <span class="Italic">Kochanny</span> nor <span class="Italic">Hanratty</span> precludes the application of later Board and court decisions addressing whether an appellant was afforded the minimum due process required by <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The post-appeal conversion at issue here contravenes <span class="Italic">Stephen's</span> due process dictates because the agency did not provide the appellant with <span class="Italic">prior</span> notice of its reasons for imposing a disciplinary action under chapter 75, in particular, an explanation of its consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors justifying the penalty of removal. <span class="Italic">See Ingram v. Department of Defense</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 149, &#x00B6; 7 (2012) (due process requires an agency to provide an employee with notice of the reasons for the adverse action); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Interior</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 5 (2009) (a party must know of the claims with which she is being charged so that she may adequately prepare and present a defense before the agency); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 304 (aggravating factors on which the agency intends to rely for imposition of an enhanced penalty, such as a prior disciplinary record, <span id="Page_2955"></span>should be included in the advance notice of charges so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those alleged factors before the agency's deciding official, and the decision notice should explain what weight was given to those factors in reaching the agency's final decision); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b) (a proposal notice "must state the specific reason(s) for the proposed action"). As the administrative judge noted below, the Board's lack of authority to mitigate an action taken under chapter 43 renders the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors irrelevant to a chapter 43 case. ID at 24-25 (citing <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 769 F.2d 1558, 1566-67 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). Indeed, the administrative judge specifically found "no indication" that the deciding official considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors "<span class="Italic">per se</span>" in reaching his decision. By permitting this post-appeal conversion, the Board engages in a legal fiction regarding the penalty by reviewing the case as if the deciding official simply misapplied the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and accepting his hearing testimony regarding <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors that he did not actually consider when taking the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority nevertheless concludes that the deciding official appropriately considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in mitigation and aggravation. However, the record shows that the deciding official did not perform the type of penalty analysis required under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> before making his decision to remove the appellant. The decision letter only briefly summarizes the appellant's pleas for mitigation in his oral reply and merely states that the deciding official considered them. There is no basis upon which to find that, at the time that he approved the appellant's removal, the deciding official undertook a complete evaluation of the evidence regarding whether the proposed removal promoted the efficiency of the service and whether the penalty was reasonable under the circumstances as required under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. Even his <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> testimony at the hearing does not demonstrate that he undertook the type of weighing and balancing of the mitigation and aggravating factors required to support a penalty under chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority further finds that the conversion of the appeal from a chapter 43 to a chapter 75 adverse action did not violate the appellant's due process rights because the proposal notice stated the performance-based reasons for the removal and because there is no indication that the deciding official's penalty determination was based on an aggravating factor that the appellant could not have reasonably known would figure into the decision. I disagree. In fact, this case highlights the prejudice arising from such post-appeal conversions. Specifically, the deciding official testified at the hearing that he found as a matter in aggravation that the appellant did not accept responsibility or express remorse for his substandard performance. However, because defenses to a chapter 43 action typically involve challenges to the agency's performance standards and its assessment of the employee's performance, an employee responding to a proposed chapter 43 action would not likely be aware that failure to express remorse for the allegedly poor performance--which would be tantamount to a concession that the agency's characterization of his performance was accurate--would weigh against him. To view the absence of such a concession as an aggravating factor after conversion makes plain the unfairness of this procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, I would find that the appellant was effectively deprived at the proposal stage of a meaningful opportunity to reply to the agency's reasons for removing him. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 501, 504 (1991) (an agency's use of one charge as a pretext for another would constitute a denial of minimum constitutional due process because an appellant would not have been afforded prior notice and an opportunity to respond to the real reason for the agency's action); <span class="Italic">cf. Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding no opportunity to make a meaningful response to the notice of proposed suspension when the limited information provided caused the employee to have to guess at the reasons for his security clearance suspension).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I would further find that the post-appeal conversion at issue here is contrary to the long-standing principle that the Board reviews an agency's decision solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">See Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also O'Keefe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 318 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">cf. Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997) (finding that the administrative judge incorrectly characterized an "improper conduct" charge as an allegation of making a threat under the criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). That principle is derived from the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp</span>., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947), which set forth the "simple but fundamental rule of administrative law...that a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency. If those grounds are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis." <span class="Italic">See Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 684 F.2d 155, 157 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (the rationale set forth in <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> applies when the reviewing body is an administrative tribunal like the Board); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Department of Education</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 61, 70-71 (1989) (applying <span class="Italic">Horne</span>). In <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, the court held that the Board "should not be in the business of affirming administrative decisions based upon how an agency might have acted if it had followed proper procedures" but should instead evaluate agency discretion as it has been exercised. <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, 684 F.2d at 157-58. The court found that the Board improperly upheld an agency action based on the agency's contention that a proper reduction in force <span class="Italic">could have</span> achieved the same result as was achieved in the case, i.e., the reduction in grade of two employees because the agency deemed them to be political employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 156-58. Here, upon finding that the agency's defective PIP notice rendered the appellant's removal unsustainable, the administrative judge should have reversed the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the initial decision because it improperly analyzed the appellant's removal as a chapter 75 disciplinary action. I would thereafter address the chapter 43 grounds upon which the agency actually removed the appellant. Contrary to the finding of the administrative judge, I would find that the PIP notice was not defective. Although it informed the appellant that his performance was currently at Level 1 (unacceptable) of five levels and set forth the criteria to achieve a Level 3 rating, it also clearly informed him that he would be provided with supervisory guidance and assistance during the PIP in order to reach "<span class="Italic">an</span> acceptable" level, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 17-18, 24 (emphasis added), which corresponds with the appropriate Level 2 rating, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 25-28 (Level 2 of the appellant's performance plan contained the same requirements as Level 3, except for the introductory words, "[w]ith supervisory advice or assistance"). Moreover, the PIP notice provided the appellant with the specific tasks that he needed to accomplish during the opportunity period. Thus, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis v. Office of Government Ethics</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-7 2006), in which the agency incorrectly informed the appellant that her performance needed to reach at least a fully successful level in certain critical elements to avoid removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the administrative judge's finding that the agency proved the underlying unacceptable performance by the higher preponderant evidence standard may be sufficient to meet part of its burden under the lesser substantial evidence standard of chapter 43, there are other elements to a chapter 43 case that the parties have not had an opportunity to address and were not adjudicated by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Manning v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) (to establish the elements of a performance-based removal action under chapter 43, the agency must prove by substantial evidence that (1) it has a performance appraisal system approved by OPM; (2) it communicated the performance standards and critical elements of the employee's position to him; (3) the employee failed to meet one or more critical elements of his position; and (4) it gave him a reasonable opportunity to improve his performance to an acceptable level). Therefore, I would vacate the initial decision and remand the appeal for adjudication under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a practical note, although the agency cannot obtain automatic reconsideration under Chapter 75 of a case that it loses under Chapter 43, the agency may try again, starting from scratch; it is also possible for the agency to initiate an action under both procedures. As a practical matter, if an agency can obtain reconsideration of a Chapter 43 case under Chapter 75 after the fact of the agency's removal decision, the employee is shortchanged of proper mitigation first evaluated by agency proposing and deciding officials--leaving the employee to the tender mercy of an AJ who is unfamiliar with the workplace environment and personalities leading to the performance case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. FAA</span>, 40 MSPR 355, 363-64 (1989) (when an agency confused an employee by making the proposal appear to stem from Chapter 43 rather than Chapter 75, and the employee claimed that mitigation would have been raised had the case been brought as a misconduct rather than a performance action, the Board determined whether the employee could successfully have claimed that a mitigation defense would have been successful in reducing or avoiding the penalty).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">During the assessment of Chapter 43 cases that agencies seek to have evaluated under Chapter 75, the determination of how a case is classified will be realistically made. Even if an agency uses an occasional reference to "efficiency of the service," with its Chapter 75 overtones, that does not convert an action clearly taken under Chapter 43 to an action under Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1403). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-291.html#sec8-289">Performance as Basis for Adverse Action</a>," concerning charges against poor performers under Chapter 75.]</p>
