<p class="Body-Text">Decisions abound analyzing evidence under the "clear and convincing" standard. The decisions are, unremarkably, factually intensive in their description of the often complex circumstances of a reprisal case. Reader patience is advised. There is no grand unifying theme.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of whistleblowing of reprisal is the predicate to analysis of the agency's evidence supporting the challenged action, <span class="Italic">Muller v. Dept. of Interior,</span> SF-0752-13-0151-I-2 (NP 2/13/2015) (an adverse action appeal):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, because the appellant failed to show that he made any protected disclosure, we need not address his final argument, alleging clear retaliatory animus in the PRB process due to his whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See also Clark v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 19 n.10 (2014) (an appellant must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor to a personnel action; otherwise the Board may not proceed to whether the agency meets its burden of showing that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the disclosure).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Skinner v. VA,</span> <a href="http://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-1312.OPINION.7-7-2020_1614863.pdf">819 Fed. Appx., 904</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("The burden rested with Skinner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she made a protected disclosure as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor to an adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">See <span id="Page_3985"></span>Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1034. Unless and until Skinner met her burden, the agency had no obligation to prove anything. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Lentz v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/LENTZ_CHASE_M_SF_1221_15_0688_W_1_FINAL_ORDER_1938136.pdf">SF-1221-15-0688-W-1</a>, n.4 (NP 6/30/2022) ("Nevertheless, we need not determine whether the appellant proved that his alleged involuntary resignation constituted a personnel action because, even assuming that the appellant met that burden, and as set forth more fully below, he has not shown that his disclosures were protected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6; 7 (2011) (holding that the Board may resolve the merits issues in an IRA appeal in any order it deems most efficient); <span class="Italic">but see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2) (permitting a finding on whether the agency met its clear and convincing evidence burden only after a finding has been made that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action).").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends on review that the administrative judge erred in concluding, in the alternative, that the agency established its affirmative defense by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the appellant in the absence of any protected activity. Because none of the appellant's alleged disclosures were both exhausted and protected under the WPA, we do not address these contentions. <span class="Italic">Kahn v.

<p class="Body-Text">Assuming proof of a protected disclosure and a demonstration that the disclosure contributed to the challenged action under appeal, 5 CFR 1209.4(e) (2022) defines the agency 's burden of establishing "clear and convincing" in support of its defense as that "measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established. It is a higher standard than 'preponderance of the evidence' as defined in 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)]." The Board's jurisdiction over an IRA case is made out through a written record demonstrating nonfrivolous allegations of protected disclosures, a report of those disclosures to OSC, and a nonfrivolous assertion that the disclosures contributed to the agency's decision to take the retaliatory personnel action. The merits of the agency's defense, that is, the clear and convincing evidence that the personnel action would have been taken in the absence of whistleblowing, goes to the merits of the case, not to the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daniels v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the remand initial decision, the administrative judge found, without elaboration, that even if the appellant established jurisdiction over her IRA appeal, the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosure. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when the personnel action at issue is not disciplinary in nature, the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor does not apply straightforwardly and it is appropriate to consider the broader question of whether the agency had legitimate reasons for its action. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 4, &#x00B6; 23. In this case, evidence regarding whether the agency had legitimate reasons for reassigning the appellant to a different geographic location is lacking. The agency's counsel stated in various pleadings that the appellant's <span class="Italic">qui tam</span> lawsuit created a "potential conflict of interest," which required her reassignment to a different duty station in order to limit her interaction with the Government contractor who was named in her lawsuit. Statements by a party's representative are not evidence, and there is no indication in the record that the agency's counsel had firsthand knowledge of the reassignment decision. <span class="Italic">See Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995). The agency did not submit a declaration or sworn statement from any individual with firsthand knowledge of the appellant's reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even crediting the agency's assertion that the appellant's <span class="Italic">qui tam</span> lawsuit created a "potential conflict of interest," it has not explained the appellant's job duties at her original duty station; how a conflict of interest arose, or could have arisen, due to the appellant's lawsuit; the nature of the conflict of interest; whether there were other job duties that the appellant could have performed without a reassignment; why the agency selected a duty station in Philadelphia, 25 miles away from Ridley Park, for the reassignment; and whether the appellant ceased working on matters involving the contractor after her reassignment. The agency has wholly failed to justify its reassignment decision, and therefore, this factor weighs in favor of the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 2022 MSPB 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 23-26 (finding that the evidentiary record did not support the agency's explanation for its decision not to select the appellant for a vacant position, and thus <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 1 weighed against the agency). The agency <span id="Page_3986"></span>has not put forth any evidence as to the second or third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors. Although the agency does not have an affirmative burden to produce evidence concerning each and every <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the Board has held than an agency's failure to present evidence of similarly situated employees cannot weigh in its favor. <span class="Italic">Soto v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 6, &#x00B6; 18. In viewing the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors as a whole, the agency has failed to put forth evidence to meet its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard for analyzing whether the agency has proven by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken a personnel action absent an appellant's whistleblowing is the same in an IRA appeal and in an affirmative defense to an otherwise appealable action. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323; <span class="Italic">Grubb v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">"Clear and convincing evidence" is a high burden of proof for the Government to bear. It is intended as such for two reasons.

Second, this heightened burden of proof required of the agency also recognizes that when it comes to proving the basis for an agency's decision, the agency controls most of the cards--the drafting of the documents supporting the decision, the testimony of witnesses who participated in the decision, and the records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board agreed that Mr. Smith was a whistleblower and that his protected disclosures contributed to the agency's decision to remove him. The Board nevertheless affirmed the agency's decision. Without addressing evidence relevant to the agency's motive to retaliate or its treatment of other similarly situated non-whistleblowers--legal error in itself--the Board ruled that because the agency had introduced strong evidence of misconduct, removal was justified. In doing so, the Board conflated two distinct inquiries: whether the agency's penalty was reasonable and whether the agency would have imposed that same penalty <span class="Italic">absent</span> Mr. Smith's protected whistleblowing. This was error....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statute prohibits an agency from penalizing its employees for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). An employee who believes he has been subjected to illegal retaliation must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he made a protected disclosure that contributed to the agency's action against him. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2012). "If the employee establishes this <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for whistleblowing, the burden of persuasion shifts to the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken 'the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1364 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)). If the agency does not show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the whistleblowing, the agency's penalty cannot be affirmed. <span class="Italic">See Siler v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 908 F.3d 1291, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2018). In determining whether the agency has carried its burden, we have instructed the Board to consider three nonexclusive factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; [2] the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and [3] any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Carr v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board's discussion of the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors is all of two sentences:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I further find based on the strength of the agency's evidence that it proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action (removal) absent any disclosure. Indeed, I find that the defiantly disrespectful misconduct described...alone would have justified his removal, especially in light of his previous suspension for similar misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the first sentence states the correct legal standard, the Board did not provide any analysis of the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors. Moreover, the second sentence applies an incorrect standard, averring that Mr. Smith's misconduct alone justified the agency's action. Contrary to the Board's statement, the merits of a whistleblower defense do not turn on the strength of the agency's evidence alone or on whether the misconduct justified removal. Those points speak to whether the agency met its burden to prove that misconduct occurred, discipline is warranted, and the chosen penalty is reasonable, factors the agency must show by preponderant evidence in every appeal from a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 114 F.3d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Hale v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 772 F.2d 882, 885 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where whistleblowing is at issue, however, the proper inquiry is not whether the agency action is justified; it is whether the agency would have acted in the same way absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 842 F.3d 1252, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The issue [in a whistleblower reprisal case] is whether substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that the Government showed independent causation by clear and convincing evidence."). "[t]he merits cannot be the determinative factor that there was no reprisal. <span class="Italic">A meritorious adverse action must be set aside where there is reprisal</span>." <span class="Italic">Siler</span>, 908 F.3d at 1298-99 (quoting <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Nies, J., concurring)). Thus, the Board's independent decision to sustain the disrespectful conduct charge--however strong the underlying evidence--did not eliminate Mr. Smith's reprisal defense. And it does not excuse the Board from analyzing the entire record and determining whether the agency clearly and convincingly proved that it would have removed Mr. Smith even absent his whistleblowing, not merely that it could have justifiably done so. On remand, the Board must ensure that the agency is held to its "high burden of proof." <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1367 (quoting 135 Cong. Rec. H747-48 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (explanatory statement on Senate Amendment to S. 20)).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our examination of the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors, however, does not provide adequate context for understanding the agency's decision to continue the suspension beyond its receipt of the FFD report. The court has held that <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors are "nonexclusive," <span class="Italic">Smith v. General Services Administration</span>, 930 F.3d 1359, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2019), and, therefore, we have considered the totality of the circumstances in this matter....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2143.Opinion.5-6-2019.pdf">923 F.3d 1004</a>, 1018-20 (Fed. Cir. 2019), applied <span class="Italic">Carr</span> to a whistleblowing defense that was resolved against an employee who was removed for failing properly to manage a VA patient scheduling system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To evaluate whether the VA would have taken the same action in the absence of Mr. Robinson's protected disclosure, we look at the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Carr v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The VA need not produce evidence with regard to each of these factors, nor must each factor weigh in favor of the agency for the VA to carry its burden. <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Instead, we consider the record as a whole and balance the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the VA clearly and independent of his protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 842 F.3d 1252, 1263 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("<span class="Italic">Miller DOJ</span>"); <span class="Italic">see also Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374 ("Evidence only clearly and convincingly supports a conclusion when it does so in the aggregate considering all the pertinent evidence in the record, and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the Board found that the VA had strong evidence to support removal. We have already concluded that substantial evidence supports a finding that Mr. Robinson was negligent in performing his duties as Associate Director and that he failed to ensure that Phoenix VA transmitted accurate information to VISN 18. Therefore, the evidence and the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor strongly support the VA's decision to remove Mr. Robinson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, a motive to retaliate, the AJ concluded that Deputy Secretary Gibson--the Deciding Official--"did not have retaliatory motive" because Mr. Robinson's statements "targeted Shulkin, not Gibson." It appears the AJ failed to consider whether Mr. Gibson had any motive to retaliate against Mr. Robinson for statements implicating the perceived ineptitude and deceit of the VA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have explained that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">those responsible for the agency's performance overall may well be motivated to retaliate even if they are not directly implicated by the disclosures, and even if they do not know the whistleblower personally, as the criticism reflects on them in their capacities as managers and employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Miller DOJ</span>, 842 F.3d at 1261-62 (quoting <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370). <span id="Page_3988"></span>While Mr. Gibson may not have had a personal motive to retaliate against Mr. Robinson for contradicting Under Secretary Shulkin, the AJ did not expressly discuss whether Mr. Gibson had a professional retaliatory motive. Mr. Robinson's statements to the Senate Committee implicated the capabilities, performance, and veracity of VA managers and employees, and implied that the VA deceived the Senate Committee. These statements occurred months before Robinson's second notice of removal. Yet the AJ appeared to dismiss wholesale Gibson's motives to retaliate. Thus, it is not clear that the evidence supports the VA for this <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, in light of Mr. Gibson's credited testimony, the Board's conclusion that he lacked motive to retaliate is not unreasonable. In discussing Mr. Gibson's retaliatory motive (or lack thereof), the AJ incorporated by reference discussion of Mr. Robinson's due process defense. There, the AJ concluded that "Gibson was not biased." J.A. 52; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. ("I find that [Gibson] considered the record as a whole and kept an open mind."). The AJ based his conclusion on an assessment of Mr. Gibson's credibility and demeanor, relying on Gibson's testimony to conclude that Gibson (1) acknowledged that disciplinary matters affect the VA in addition to those disciplined; (2) spent a lot of time assessing the evidence against Mr. Robinson; and (3) was misquoted in the <span class="Italic">New York Times</span> article where he allegedly stated removal of Phoenix VA personnel will "help VA 'move past' the wait-time scandal that has consumed the agency for nearly two years." The AJ also gave weight to the fact that Mr. Gibson did not sustain Charge 3, the whistleblower retaliation charge. Given the AJ's reliance on Mr. Gibson's testimony, the AJ did not unreasonably conclude that Mr. Gibson had no retaliatory motive, either professionally or personally. The second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor therefore slightly favors the VA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Robinson contends that the VA failed to provide any evidence that it treated him the same as similarly situated individuals, and that those individuals did not make protected disclosures. The Board found that there was "mixed evidence" as to whether the VA doled out analogous discipline to similarly situated individuals. For example, the VA removed Mr. Robinson's direct supervisor, Ms. Helman, the Director of Phoenix VA; Dr. Deering, Chief of Staff; and Mr. Robinson's direct subordinate, Mr. Curry, Chief of HAS. Helman and Curry were similarly situated individuals, having supervisory positions at Phoenix VA and responsible for overseeing scheduling issues. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326-27 ("For an employee to be considered similarly situated to an individual who is disciplined, it must be shown that the conduct and the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the comparison employee are similar to those of the disciplined individual."). The AJ weighed the removal of Helman, Deering, and Curry against Robinson's assertion that individuals at other VA centers were not removed despite their scheduling improprieties. Based on the entirety of the evidence, the AJ concluded that this factor "neither helps nor hurts the agency's case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the AJ did not affirmatively conclude that Helman, Deering, and Curry were similarly situated. Nor did he conclude that these individuals had not made protected disclosures. Similarly, the AJ did not affirmatively state that VA personnel at other agency centers suffering from scheduling mishaps were similarly situated. Instead, the AJ presumed that all individuals considered under this factor--Helman, Deering, Curry, and VA personnel identified by Mr. Robinson--were "non-whistleblowers." J.A. 48 (stating "and which I assume, without deciding, involved non-whistleblowers."). Likewise, it appears that the AJ assumed everyone identified in relation to this factor was treated similarly to Mr. Robinson. This mixed record causes the last <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor to be neutral. Accordingly, it was not unreasonable for the AJ to count it as neutral.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the evidence in the aggregate, including the strength of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor one, the Board's conclusion that the VA met its clear and convincing burden was supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In a contract case referencing some civilian employment decisions, the Federal Circuit offered definition of the "clear and convincing" standard, <span class="Italic">Am-Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United States</span>, 281 F.3d 1234, 1239-40 (Fed. Cir. 2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts generally recognize three standards of proof: preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing, and beyond a reasonable doubt. <span class="Italic">See Price v. Symsek,</span> 988 F.2d 1187, 1191 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Of the three, we believe that clear and convincing most appropriately describes the burden of proof applicable to the presumption of the governments good faith. This is so because, for one, the presumption of good faith, as used here, applies only in the situation where a government official allegedly engaged in fraud or in some other quasi-criminal wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See Addington</span> <span class="Italic">v. Texas,</span> 441 U.S. 418, 423-24, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed.2d 323 (1979) (discussing the three burdens of proof outlined above and the situations in which they ordinarily apply). In addition, we believe the clear and convincing standard most closely approximates the language traditionally used to describe the burden for negating the good faith presumption; namely, the "well-nigh, irrefragable" proof standard. Specifically, we have described clear and convincing burden as such:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A requirement of proof by clear and convincing evidence imposes a heavier burden upon a litigant than that imposed by requiring proof by preponderant evidence but a somewhat lighter burden than that imposed by requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Clear and convincing evidence has been described as evidence which produces in the mind of the trier of fact an abiding conviction that the truth of a factual contention is <span class="Italic">"highly probable."</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Price,</span> 988 F.2d at 1191 (internal citations omitted) (determining the quantum of proof required to establish priority in an interference proceeding with an issued patent) (emphasis added). "Well-nigh irrefragable" proof similarly refers to evidence that "cannot be refuted or disproved; incontrovertible, incontestable, indisputable, irrefutable, undeniable (said of a statement, argument, etc., or the person who advances it.)" Oxford English Dictionary 93 (2d ed. 1991) (defining "irrefragable"). As with the clear and convincing standard, the requirement of "well-nigh irrefragable"' proof also sets a high hurdle for a challenger seeking to prove that a government official acted in bad faith:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the cases where the court has considered allegations of bad faith, the necessary "irrefragable proof' has been equated with evidence of some specific intent to injure the plaintiff. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. United States,</span> the court compared bad faith to actions which are "motivated alone by malice." In <span class="Italic">Knotts,</span> the court found bad faith in a civilian pay suit only in view of a proven "conspiracy...to get rid of plaintiff." Similarly, the court in <span class="Italic">Struck Constr. Co. v. United States,</span> found bad faith when confronted by a course of Governmental conduct which was "designedly oppressive." But in <span class="Italic">Librach,</span> the court found no bad faith because the officials involved were not "actuated by animus toward the plaintiff."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kalvar</span>, 543 F.2d at 1302 (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Sanders v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Serv.,</span> 801 F.2d 1328, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (stating that "there is a <span class="Italic">strong presumption</span> in the law that administrative actions are correct and taken in good faith") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Caldwell &#x0026; Santmyer, Inc. v. Glickman</span>, 55 F.3d 1578, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (reiterating the principle that "[a] contractor can overcome [the presumption that the government acts in good faith] only if it shows through 'well nigh irrefragable proof that the government had a specific intent to injure it") (quoting <span class="Italic">Torncello v. United States</span>, 231 Ct. Cl. 20, 681 F.2d 756, 770 (1982)); <span class="Italic">Torncello</span>, 681 F.2d at 770 (stating "the government...is assumed always to act in good faith, subject only to an <span class="Italic">extremely difficult</span> showing by the plaintiff to the contrary.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Librach</span>, 147 Ct. Cl. at 612 (stating that "clear evidence to the contrary" is necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of the government).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this well-established precedent, it logically follows that showing a government official acted in bad faith is intended to be very difficult, and that something stronger than a "preponderance of evidence" is necessary to overcome the presumption that he acted in good faith, i.e., properly. This is especially so when, as in this case, years have passed between the occurrence of the underlying facts and the allegation of bad faith.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has met its burden, the Board will consider all of the relevant factors, including the following: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6; 36 (2011).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency has not presented strong evidence in support of its reasons for cancelling the telework agreement. Those reasons are supported by Ayers's testimony, but there is little contemporaneous documentation to support Ayers's conclusion other than the narrative she provided to the appellant when she made her decision. In addition, the record shows that the appellant grieved the decision to cancel her telework agreement. She prevailed in her grievance, and the agency reversed the cancellation within 4 months. The appellant's successful grievance is by no means dispositive of the question of whether the agency has met the clear and convincing evidence test, but it is evidence that tends to undercut the strength of the agency's reasons for cancelling the agreement in the first place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed previously, to meet the clear and convincing standard, the evidence must produce a "firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d). Although the agency has presented evidence in support of its burden of proof, upon considering all of the pertinent evidence of record, we are not left with the firm belief that the agency would have cancelled the appellant's telework agreement in any event. We are simply not persuaded that the agency's evidence rises to the clear and convincing level. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1367 (discussing legislative history showing that Congress intended the clear and convincing evidence standard to be a heavy burden to meet).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before Ayers, the appellant's supervisor was Greg Thompson, who rated the appellant "Excellent" for rating year 2006 despite some concern about the appellant's communication skills. The appellant received a $1,900 cash award in April 2007 for her work on a conference that took place in early 2007. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the 2007 rating was consistent with a pattern of prior "Successful" ratings, while there is evidence that the 2007 rating was somewhat inconsistent with the agency's perception of the appellant's performance in the recent past.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that this is a close case. However, after considering all of the pertinent evidence of record, we find that the agency's evidence is insufficient to meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing <span id="Page_3990"></span>evidence that it would have given the appellant the same rating absent any whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1367.</p>

Furthermore, the agency's limited evidence--that was directed solely to whether the appellant suffered a personnel action--consisted of general statements that did not satisfactorily provide a nonretaliatory explanation for the personnel actions (and failed to even address one of them).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Forshey v. Gober</span>, 226 F.3d 1299, 1304-05 (Fed. Cir. 2000), abstractly distinguished preponderant and clear and convincing evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A standard of proof serves to "instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions." <span class="Italic">In re Winship,</span> 397 U.S. 358, 370, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed.2d 368 (1970).

Kramer,</span> 455 U.S. 745, 755, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed.2d 599 (1982). Over time, three general standards have emerged: proof by a preponderance of the evidence, proof by clear and convincing evidence, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's discussion in <span class="Italic">Addington v. Texas,</span> 441 U.S. 418, 423-25, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed.2d 323 (1979), provides a helpful summary of the standards of proof and their rationales. In civil suits, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been employed, allocating the risk of error almost evenly between parties in a situation with which society is only minimally concerned. At the other end is the reasonable doubt standard, typically reserved for criminal cases. It provides the toughest standard for rebuttal of the presumption that an individual is innocent until proven guilty, reflecting the grave concern for errors that could send an innocent individual to prison. As the Court noted, "[I]n the administration of criminal justice, our society imposes almost the entire risk of error upon itself." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 423-24, 99 S. Ct. 1804.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The clear and convincing evidence standard has been used in civil suits where "particularly important individual interests" are at stake, under circumstances where the interests are substantially more important than the "mere loss of money," or where there are accusations of "quasicriminal wrongdoing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under these conditions, societal interest dictates that one side should be afforded protection from the risk of error that exceeds the limits of a preponderance standard but falls short of the exacting standard in criminal cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Markland v.

However, the appellant's reliance upon <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> is misplaced. The <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are those factors that may be relevant while considering an agency's chosen penalty in a chapter 75 appeal, when the agency has the burden of proving that its penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). In the instant IRA appeal, the agency is not required to prove that its chosen penalty is reasonable; it is required to prove that it would have taken the same personnel action notwithstanding the appellant's protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 569, 576 (1992) (recognizing that, in an IRA appeal, the Board can either grant or deny a request for corrective action, and the appropriateness of the penalty imposed by the agency is not at issue).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The evidentiary analysis of what constitutes an employer's clear and convincing evidence refuting a reprisal allegation in an IRA case may include the employer's treatment of other employees who engaged in similar misconduct, <span class="Italic">King v. VA</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. 192, 193 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming, solely for purposes of this appeal, that King made a protected disclosure and that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action, the agency can sustain the discipline if it can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the protected disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2). We conclude that the Board's finding that the agency would have taken its action regardless of the protected alleged activity was supported by clear and convincing substantial evidence. As found by the Board, the evidence of disrespectful conduct was both "strong" and "undisputed" and the agency had imposed far more serious discipline on "similarly situated individuals," whom the Board found were not whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are no comparators, that factor is of no significance in the reprisal analysis. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-1221-13-0295-W-1 (NP 8/18/2014) ("<span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three is the comparable treatment of non-whistleblowers. The record does not contain evidence that non-whistleblowers had engaged in similar conduct but had not had their appointments terminated. Thus, the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is not a relevant consideration in this case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Sachdeva v. VA,</span> PH-1221-09-0265-W-1 (NP 4/4/2011), although the appellant was detailed out of a position after she made a protected disclosure, the agency's practice--determined by the Board to be clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action without regard to the appellant's status as a whistleblower--was to detail all individuals out of their positions during an internal investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Chief of Staff was the management official responsible for detailing the appellant out of her position, and he notified her on August 1, 2008, that the action was effective that day. The appellant had copied him on the e-mail she sent to her subordinate on July 31, 2008. The Chief of Staff knew of the appellant's disclosure and detailed her out of her position the following day, which is well within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. Therefore, under the knowledge/timing test, the appellant has proven the contributing factor element.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, even though the appellant showed by preponderant evidence that she engaged in whistleblowing that was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to detail her, the Board will not order corrective action if the agency shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action even absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Wadhwa</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 14. In determining whether an agency has made that showing, the Board considers the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action, the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision, and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers, but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Clear and convincing evidence is "that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d). The administrative judge found that the agency made the required showing, but, in so doing, he did not consider the factors set forth above. Therefore, we do so now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties are in agreement that a breach of protocol occurred. The agency presented evidence that, following the directed fact-finding and based upon it, the Medical Center Director decided that it was appropriate to convene an ABI. He further testified that standard practice was to temporarily detail those involved in the subject matter of an ABI, in order to ensure that any improper practices not continue. Other agency witnesses, including the Assistant Chief of Staff, the Chief of Staff, and the Quality Manager, corroborated the Director's testimony with regard to that practice. The Director testified that, as the head of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, the appellant was deemed to have the necessary involvement in the breach of protocol. In his view, as the Chief Investigator of this particular protocol, she knew or should have known that there was a problem. The Research Compliance Officer confirmed that the Chief Investigator bears sole responsibility for her protocol. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency had strong evidence in support of its action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency denied that there was any motive to retaliate against the <span id="Page_3991"></span>appellant on the part of its officials. The agency does not challenge the appellant's assertion that, prior to this incident, she had not been disciplined, and that her most recent previous performance rating was Outstanding. The appellant testified that it was her view that the Chief Medical Technologist, who was her subordinate and the phlebotomist's second-level supervisor, had too much authority in the laboratory as a non-physician. The appellant further testified that she had complained about this situation to management, surmising that "that's probably why they want[] to get rid of me." She also expressed her belief that she was being "scapegoated." Beyond such speculation, however, the record contains no evidence that the agency had any motive to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as noted, there was substantial testimony that the agency's practice is to detail out of their positions individuals who are involved in the subject matter of an ABI. The Medical Center Director testified that, during his tenure, he had convened approximately six ABIs and detailed those individuals involved. There was no evidence that any of the six were whistleblowers. Therefore, the agency has established that it takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above, we find that the agency has met its burden of producing in our minds a "firm belief" that it would have detailed the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosure. Therefore, the appellant is not entitled to corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duggan v. DOD</span>, 484 Fed. Appx. 533, 538-39 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), provides another example of clear and convincing evidence in a whistleblower reprisal case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, with regard to Case A, the AJ determined that the spreadsheet faxed by Mr. Duggan was a protected disclosure under the WPA and was a contributing factor that led to his two-day suspension. However, applying the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors, the AJ determined that the agency had shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action despite the disclosure. The AJ found that other DCAA employees had been disciplined for making disparaging remarks about contractors absent whistleblower allegations, that the agency presented significant other evidence unrelated to whistle blowing activity in support of its personnel action, and that the main concern the agency had with regard to the fax was not with its contents but "the negligent fashion by which [the fax was sent], and the disparaging and unprofessional nature of the comments on it." The AJ also found that "[a]t the hearing, [Mr. Duggan] admitted to making the disparaging comments that were the basis for his discipline...but similarly contended that they were justified because they were factual." In short, substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that "[b]ased on the strong evidence the agency presented in support of its reasons for taking the action, as well [as] the fact that appellant has not shown evidence that the deciding official...had any retaliatory motive, I am left with the firm conviction that, even in the absence of [Mr. Duggan's] disclosures, the agency would have issued [him] the suspension under all the circumstances."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the AJ found that the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have lowered the Appellant's promotion appraisal for the period in question and, separately, would have reassigned him absent Mr. Duggan's disclosures. The AJ relied on the testimony of the Regional Audit Manager with regard to Mr. Duggan's promotion appraisal who testified that "he was aware of the misconduct underlying [Mr. Duggan's] suspension, and that he factored that misconduct into his promotion appraisal score...[and that]he was not aware of appellant's alleged disclosures." He also testified that "misconduct such as making disparaging remarks about colleagues and contractors is considered in assessing a promotion appraisal because it is indicative of whether or not the employee can foster good relations amongst colleagues and function as part of a team." With regard to Mr. Duggan's reassignment, the AJ relied on testimony that Mr. Duggan was reassigned not due to his disclosures but because he refused to sign the required auditor independence statement. The record contains substantial evidence to support the AJ's finding that the personnel actions taken by the agency would have been taken absent Mr. Duggan's disclosures.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken a personnel action in the absence of protected disclosures, the Board has considered the strength of the agency's evidence in support of the action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved with the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Interior,</span> 74 MSPR 666, 672-73 (1997).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues extensively on review that the evidence does not support a finding that she violated any of the ethics regulations cited by the OIG. However, in an IRA appeal, the relevant inquiry is not whether the appellant committed any actual misconduct, but whether the agency had strong evidence to support its personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 12.

An agency may direct an employee's reassignment, without a reduction in pay or grade, in a manner consistent with its rules and regulations and any applicable collective bargaining agreement, as long as the reassignment is based on legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick v. Department of State,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 11 (2002) ("[t]he Board's general review of a directed reassignment action is to assure that it is used for legitimate reasons and therefore its focus is on the legitimacy of the reasons for the reassignment"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102(a) (an agency has the authority to reassign a career employee). Mr. Hartman's testimony and the August 20, 2007 reassignment letter show that Mr. Hartman's decision was influenced less by the OIG's findings of ethical violations than it was by the practical effects that the appellant's conduct as described by the OIG had on her ability to perform her duties as Montana Division Administrator.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Deciding official Hoffman testified that charges two, three, and five considered together ("aggregated") would warrant removal and that he would not have removed the appellant if all 3 charges were not sustained. Given that the Federal Circuit has found the conduct alleged in charge two to be protected whistleblowing activity, the undisputed record plainly establishes that the agency would not have removed the appellant in the absence of her protected whistleblowing disclosures. Moreover, for all of the reasons discussed above, especially when Hoffman's testimony is considered with the significant taint on Hoffman's removal decision because of Murphy, the weakness of the charges and timing of the removal action, as well as Murphy's and Hoffman's strong motives to retaliate for the appellant's protected whistleblowing activity, we find that the agency failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken any action against the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosures.</p>

Under the circumstances, and notwithstanding the agency's disagreement as to how those instances should be viewed, we agree with the administrative judge's assessment that, although the appellant was not an ideal employee, he was not left with the firm conviction that the agency would have terminated her absent her whistleblowing.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">..."Clear and convincing evidence</span> is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d). As explained by one of the sponsors of the Whistleblower Protection Act, "clear and convincing evidence" is an intentionally high standard of proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"Clear and convincing evidence" is a high standard of proof for the Government to carry. It is intended as such for two reasons. First, this standard of proof comes into play only if the employee has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the action against him or her--in other words, that the agency action was tainted. Second, this heightened burden of proof on the agency recognizes that when it comes to proving the basis for an agency's decision, the agency controls most of the cards--the drafting of the documents supporting the decision, the testimony of witnesses who participated in the decision, and the records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases. In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that the agency bears a heavy burden to justify its actions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contended that it was common practice for agency employees to keep personal firearms (including handguns) in their vehicles parked at the agency's parking lots, and that this was common knowledge. He also contended that, prior to the events of August 25 and September 6, 2000, the agency had never notified employees that such conduct was improper. He further contended that, when confronted by Lanting and Martin on September 6, he asked them to look at the firearms in other employees' vehicles in the parking lot, but that they refused to do so. Finally, the appellant contended that no other employees were disciplined for this conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the agency in fact punished the appellant alone for conduct that it knew or should have known was common practice among agency employees, it is hard to see how it could establish in a clear and convincing fashion that it would have so acted in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosure. In his prehearing submission, the appellant listed five witnesses who could offer testimony on this issue. The AJ approved only one of these witnesses (Samuel Cook), excluding the others "for lack of relevancy." The appellant described the expected testimony of the excluded four witnesses as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Cliff Zee</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">He can testify that employees carried weapons in their private vehicles, that they did so was common knowledge, and that managers walked by those vehicles daily for years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Jeff Bailes</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">He can testify that...employees carried weapons in their vehicles parked at the locks. That he was familiar with the employees who worked there. That over the years this was done openly and was common knowledge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Floyd Mahaffey</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">He can testify that employees at Jonesville Lock and Dam carried weapons in their private vehicles over the years, especially, <span id="Page_3993"></span>during hunting season when they would hunt before and after work.... That any prohibition against employees carrying weapons was never brought up in training nor at work and it was common knowledge that employees did so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Glen Hinton</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Hinton was employed by the Agency as a Lock Operator/Maintenance worker. He worked at all five locks and dams under the Monroe Field Office. He can testify that [the appellant], and a majority of the employees under Monroe were avid hunters. That at every lock and dam he and the employees hunted before and after work. That they carried their weapons in their private vehicles, in gun racks and rifle cases. That when he worked at the Monroe Office he and other employees parked directly in front of the Monroe Office where Robert Martin and the other manager's [sic] offices were. That the managers walked by these vehicles with the weapons visible in gun racks, a number of times each day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether other employees engaged in similar conduct and were not punished is relevant to the dispositive issue in this case--whether the agency proved that it would have taken the same personnel actions in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323. The expected testimony of each of the four excluded witnesses was directly relevant to this issue. We observe in this regard that agency managers were on specific notice of the appellant's allegations as to other employees' conduct at the time they effected the two personnel actions. An agency cannot avoid the issue of disparate treatment by refusing to investigate an employee's allegations. To have proceeded with the suspension and lowered performance appraisal without investigating whether the appellant's allegations of disparate treatment were true would tend to indicate that the stated reasons for these personnel actions were a pretext for retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Cf. Russell v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (1997) (the Board will consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not essential to the appellant's claim of disparate treatment, proof that responsible agency officials had actual knowledge, prior to proposing the suspension and preparing his annual performance appraisal, that employees routinely kept firearms in their personal vehicles in the agency's parking lots, would provide even stronger evidence that the personnel actions were retaliatory in nature. We note in this regard that establishing that it was common knowledge that employees kept firearms in their vehicles, and that such conduct was obvious to the casual observer, could support an inference that the agency officials proposing and taking the personnel actions against the appellant had such knowledge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above reasons, we conclude that the exclusion of these four witnesses was an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that, in March 2000, Martin called him into his office and in a "very angry and hostile manner expressed his resentment for having to answer these matters to Colonel Crear." The appellant testified that Martin was "red faced" and "one hundred percent out of control" during this meeting. If true, this would constitute evidence of a strong motive on Martin's part to retaliate against the appellant for his protected disclosure to Col. Crear, as it was Martin who proposed the appellant's 14-day suspension and inserted negative comments in his annual performance appraisal. Yet the initial decision failed even to mention this meeting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an AJ's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision, <span class="Italic">Marques v.

The existence and nature of the alleged March 2000 meeting between the appellant and Martin was too important to the existence and strength of a motive to retaliate not to be addressed in the initial decision. In the remand initial decision, the AJ must summarize the pertinent evidence, state which version he believes, and explain in detail why he found the chosen version more credible. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge made detailed findings on the clear and convincing evidence issue and found that the agency failed to meet its burden. She found that several facts undermined the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its actions. Among other things, the administrative judge found that the proposing official never reviewed the evidentiary package supporting the proposed demotion; the proposing official failed to order a customary case analysis for the matter; the individual advising the proposing official rejected a case analysis by the servicing personnel office that recommended a 30-day suspension without even discussing it with the proposing official; the deciding official lacked understanding of the evidence supporting the demotion action; and the appellant remained responsible for leading and providing advice and policy in the position to which he was demoted even though the agency's proffered reason for the demotion was to take such responsibilities away from him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found evidence to show that the agency treated non-whistleblowers less harshly than it treated the appellant, comparing the agency's treatment of the CFO upon whom the appellant blew the whistle with its treatment of the appellant himself. The administrative judge found that the agency failed to investigate the CFO's misconduct even after it learned of it, whereas the agency immediately moved the appellant out of his position and instituted an investigation when it learned of his misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.See</span> <span class="Italic">Shibuya v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 402, 407-12 (1993), applying the clear and convincing evidentiary rebuttal test, involved a reassignment followed by a removal from the new position because of the appellant's inability to perform the new job. The Board's analysis, although extensive as to the facts, was imprecise in legal analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to reassign him. The evidence of record shows that the appellant filed a written complaint questioning the procedures through which his immediate supervisor (Mr. Bautista) had been appointed. The hearing record shows that the deciding official "probably" knew about the complaint and "might have" known that the appellant had filed it. A management director (Mr. Kirby) who had advised the deciding official on the reassignment stated that he knew about the complaint and who had filed it. Further, although he did not know that the appellant had filed a complaint, the appellant's second-line supervisor (Lt. Kernen) admitted that the appellant had frequently complained to him about Mr. Bautista's appointment and had threatened "to tell somebody that there was a violation." It appears that Lt. Kernen also advised the deciding official on the reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a thorough review of this background, the administrative judge concluded that enough circumstantial evidence had been produced to show that the deciding official knew of the appellant's whistleblowing activity. The agency has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant met his burden here on the contributing factor issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McClellan v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 MSPR 139, 145-47 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that it had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action against the appellant absent his protected disclosure. The appellant conceded that he had initially requested reassignment but stated that, several days before it was to have become effective, he had asked the agency to cancel the reassignment. With some conflict over specific dates, agency officials confirmed this account. <span id="Page_3994"></span>The reassignment was part of a "swap," in which the appellant was transferred from the Supply Department to work as a Budget Analyst, and a Budget Analyst (Ms. Dahl) was transferred from the Budget and Accounting Office to work in the Supply Department. The agency's reason for effecting the reassignment over the appellant's objections was concern for Ms. Dahl, whose medical problems had grown worse in the Budget Office as a result of stress, and who was expected by the agency to have less difficulty in the Supply Department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency had failed to carry its burden here by clear and convincing evidence. He found that the agency's explanation was not "entirely persuasive," stating that the agency had not shown that Ms. Dahl's medical problems required immediate action and that she was not "actually given an easier job with fewer budgetary duties." He further concluded that "in realistic terms" the appellant was not "well-qualified" to work as a Budget Analyst. Finally, he remarked that "the appellant's whistleblowing had created a difficult situation in the Supply Department" and that Lt. Kernen as well as two other agency officials had an "obvious motive" in completing the reassignment against the appellant's wishes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree that the agency failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the appellant absent his whistleblowing activity, we disagree with the analysis used by the administrative judge to reach that conclusion. The administrative judge stated that there was no evidence indicating retaliatory intent on the part of any agency official and that a showing of such intent was not a necessary part of his analysis of the issue. The latter assertion is incorrect. If there were truly <span class="Italic">no</span> evidence (either direct or inferred) of retaliatory intent in the record, it would have been correct for the administrative judge to have accepted as sufficient any reasonable explanation offered by the agency to show that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosure. However, it appears that the administrative judge perceived certain shortcomings in the agency's explanations and inferred the existence of retaliatory intent from the circumstances surrounding the action. We agree that such intent can be inferred here, but not for the reasons given by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge essentially gave four reasons for his finding that the agency had failed to meet its burden of proof. First, he found that the agency's contention that it had denied the appellant's request to cancel the reassignment because of its concern for Ms. Dahl was unconvincing because she was not on a performance improvement plan at the time and there was no evidence that her problems (performance or medical) required immediate action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is clear, however, that Ms. Dahl was having significant performance problems prior to her reassignment. Marilyn Huff, Janet Covington, and Susan Muller testified that Ms. Dahl suffered from epilepsy and that she had difficulties meeting deadlines and coping with the pressures of her job at the Budget Office. Mr. Kirby, Ms. Covington, and Ms. Muller also testified that, prior to the reassignment, they were concerned about Ms. Dahl's performance problems and had considered either taking a performance action against her or placing her in a less stressful environment. Thus, when the appellant requested reassignment, Mr. Kirby and Ms. Muller concluded that a job "swap" with Ms. Dahl would be an effective way of addressing both Ms. Dahl's performance problems and the appellant's dissatisfaction in the Supply Department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second reason relied upon by the administrative judge was that while the agency's stated reason for the "swap" was to find an "easier" job for Ms. Dahl, she was reassigned from the position of Budget Analyst, GS-09, in the Budget Office, to the position of Budget Analyst, GS-09, in the Supply Department. The administrative judge thus concluded that Ms. Dahl was not actually given "an easier job with fewer budgetary duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's reasoning misapprehends the agency's explanation for the "swap." One purpose was to find a different, less stressful, job for Ms. Dahl that she could perform satisfactorily. It was not to find her an "easier job with fewer budgetary duties." In addition, the administrative judge's conclusion necessarily rests upon the flawed premise that all positions with the same occupational title must, and always do, have exactly the same duties, responsibilities, and pressures (time deadlines, etc.) in exactly the same proportions. The record clearly shows that, although Ms. Dahl's job title remained unchanged, the work environment at the Supply Department was considerably less stressful than at the Budget Office. Thus, while she had been unable to perform in the high pressure environment of her former position, her performance in her new position was "outstanding." Moreover, the appellant's problems with depression, which rendered him unable to perform in the Budget Office, apparently developed in response to conditions there that were more stressful than at the Supply Department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third reason relied upon by the administrative judge was his unilateral conclusion that the appellant was not well-qualified for a Budget Analyst position. The administrative judge found that the appellant had spent no more than 20% of his time on budget matters in his former position and that the appellant was not computer literate. Although the administrative judge did not rely on or otherwise reference the classification standards for the Budget Analyst position, he nonetheless concluded that computer literacy was a "practical requirement for a Budget Analyst."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Dolores Williams, Personnel Management Specialist, stated that she determined that the appellant met the qualifications requirements for the Budget Analyst position based on her review of the qualification standards and a review of the appellant's position description for his previous position. In addition, Ms. Suzanne Flaiban, Supervisory Personnel Management Specialist, testified that she had had 10 years experience in her field and was familiar with the qualifications requirements for the position of Budget Analyst. She asserted that appellant was qualified for the position because, in his Housing Manager position, his performance standards had a critical element concerning budget work, his position description set forth budget responsibilities, and he had been responsible for preparing and executing the budget. The appellant submitted no evidence to challenge the agency's assessment that he met the basic qualifications for the position of Budget Analyst. The administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant was not "well-qualified" for the Budget Analyst position was obviously not based upon a comparison of the appellant's qualifications to the government's qualification standards. Thus, we cannot rely upon it as a basis for concluding that the agency did not meet its burden of proof in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fourth reason relied upon by the administrative judge was his conclusion that "appellant's whistleblowing had created a difficult situation in the Supply Department. That being the case, Lt. Kernen had an obvious motive in completing the reassignment." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, we note that the administrative judge failed to cite any evidence to support his conclusion. Lt. Kernen testified that he had not been informed that the appellant had actually filed a complaint. He also averred that the investigation of appellant's disclosure would not have reflected adversely upon him, for the decisions complained about had all been made by his predecessors. Thus, his fitness report would not have been affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lt. Kernen did testify that he felt that the appellant was not a "team player" and that he thought that the appellant's conflict with Mr. Bautista (appellant's first-line supervisor and the employee whose hiring had been the subject of appellant's complaint) contributed to this. Lt. Kernen explained that, when he asked the appellant a budget question, the appellant was not helpful or supportive and that this lack of cooperation hindered his efforts to understand complex budget matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lt. Kernen's testimony thus disclosed that there was some conflict in the Supply Department. Yet, there is no evidence that this conflict was caused by the appellant's disclosure; rather, it seems clear from a review of the entire record that it was caused by the appellant's lingering resentment over the fact that Bautista was hired for the job the appellant wanted and by appellant's uncooperative attitude. Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the appellant did not even try to refute Lt. Kernen's testimony describing the appellant's lack of helpfulness and cooperation on budget matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the agency did not show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the appellant in the absence of his protected disclosure. Mr. Kirby, Ms. Covington, and Ms. Muller testified that they denied the appellant's August 9, 1991 request to cancel the reassignment because Ms. Dahl had already been informed of the "swap" and the paperwork had already been processed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's explanation could, under other circumstances, perhaps be sufficient to explain its action. However, in view of Ms. Covington's testimony about the events of August 8, 1991, we find it insufficient to meet the agency's burden in this case. She testified that she had heard that the appellant was hesitant about accepting the reassignment. Thus, she called him on August 8, and "I said that I needed an answer--'yes or no?'" This conversation occurred <span class="Italic">after</span> she had talked to Ms. Dahl. Her testimony must be construed to mean that the agency was willing to cancel the reassignment at the appellant's request on August 8, 1991. The agency offered no satisfactory explanation of why it could not act in the same way 24 hours later. The agency clearly had not taken any irrevocable actions in the interim, nor even any that could be classified as constituting administrative disruption. Accordingly, we find that the agency has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the appellant in the absence of his protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 663 n.14 (1990), citing 135 Cong. Rec. S2780 (March 16, 1989) (an agency bears a heavy burden to justify an action against an employee once it has been shown that whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a challenge to a performance appraisal, "unbiased [supervisory] comments alone are insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the agency would have given the appellant the same rating absent his protected disclosures." <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 666, 675 (1997). Under <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the agency is expected to provide precise explanations of performance <span id="Page_3995"></span>deficiencies and procedural irregularities in the rating process if it is to counter successfully an appellant's laudatory evaluation of his own performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 628, 641 (1996) ("[W]e note that lack of evidence of animus toward the appellant because of his disclosures is irrelevant in this case. It is not up to the appellant (or the Special Counsel) to prove animus. Rather it is the agency's responsibility to prove by clear and convincing evidence that its actions were justified.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board analysis of the motives of agency officials may include consideration of the intensity of adverse publicity resulting from disclosures and reactions of officials to disclosures by others that are similar to the disclosures made by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 89 MSPR 529, 540-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-27 (2001) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 166 (2002)), remanded for further consideration by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the three high-level management officials whom the appellant had accused of retaliation--i.e., the District Director, the Deputy District Director, and the Special Assistant to the Deputy Director--did not have "any significant, personal stake in the information disclosed by the appellant" and that they had "little motive to retaliate...." His conclusion that the agency would have taken the same personnel actions against the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosures was based in part on this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, however, the appellant's protected disclosures concerned the functioning of one of the agency's programs, i.e., the CUSA program. Moreover, the Los Angeles <span class="Italic">Times</span> article mentioned previously appeared on the front page of that newspaper, and it is undisputed that an article on the same subject--an article that included a picture of the appellant--appeared in a Spanish-language newspaper. We also note that, during the months immediately after the appellant made her disclosures to the news media, Congress held a series of hearings addressing a contested election that was alleged to have been influenced by voting improprieties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 144 Cong. Rec. H72 (daily ed. Jan. 28, 1998). The alleged improprieties that were the subject of those hearings included those covered by the appellant's disclosures, i.e., the alleged registration of persons who were not United States citizens. We note further that the agency does not appear to have contested the truth of the appellant's disclosures regarding the CUSA program, and that the administrative judge found there was evidence corroborating the disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the District Director issued a memorandum to all district employees on September 24, 1996--less than 4 months before the publication of the Los Angeles <span class="Italic">Times</span> article mentioned above--that appears to have been prompted by the publication that day of another <span class="Italic">Times</span> article critical of the CUSA program. In that article, the District Director described the article that had just been published as one "about the integrity of the Citizenship USA process in this District," and he stated, "I feel that it is unfortunate that an employee of this District considers it necessary to impugn the good work that we have all done by providing inaccurate and inappropriate information to the general public through the media." He stated further that he thought "it most unfortunate that such information contained in the Los Angeles Times' article casts dispersions [sic] upon the employees of this District...." While the appellant does not claim to have been the source of the information in the September 24 <span class="Italic">Times</span> article, the statements quoted above support the appellant's claim of retaliatory animus by indicating that the District Director responded in a negative and disapproving manner to disclosures similar to those the appellant later made.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board shows some proclivity to sustain discipline that can be justified independently of concerns of agency officials about protected disclosures that they find irritating. The Board's analysis as to the measure of justification necessary to meet the clear and convincing evidence test boils down to its determination that, first, there were nonretaliatory reasons for the discipline and, second, that the penalty was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. VA</span>, 84 MSPR 78, 89 &#x00B6; 25 (1999), noted of the motivation of agency managers, balanced against misconduct charged against the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record leads us to conclude that the officials who participated in this action were motivated to remove the appellant because they had compelling reasons to believe that, as a supervisor, he had committed serious misconduct deserving of removal and that it was their obligation to protect patients and employees from possible future incidents of this type. Thus, we conclude that, to the extent any part of the agency's action against the appellant was motivated by reprisal for any whistleblowing activity, such motivation was slight, at best.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence shows that there are no other physicians, let alone supervising physicians such as the appellant, who committed the kind of misconduct involved here. Thus, there is no evidence showing that the agency treated the appellant any differently than it treats similarly situated employees who are not whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency had strong evidence before it when it took the removal action; it had, at most, a slight motivation to retaliate against the appellant because of his purported whistleblowing; and there is nothing to show that the appellant was treated differently than similarly situated nonwhistleblowers. Weighing these factors, we find that the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant on the reasons asserted in Dr. Headley's decision letter, absent the purported disclosures<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rutberg v. Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Administration</span>, 78 MSPR 130, 147 (1998); <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 698; <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 MSPR 347, 351-52 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 96 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 119, 130 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 F.3d 1238 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table)<span class="Italic">. See generally Lachance v. White</span>, No. 98-3249, slip op. at 5 (Fed. Cir. May 14, 1999) ("The WPA is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct."). We therefore reverse the administrative judge's contrary finding and deny the appellant's request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another analysis is provided by <span class="Italic">Charest v. FEMA</span>, 54 MSPR 436, 437-43 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 11, 1990, the agency issued a letter of reprimand to the appellant, a GS-12 Operations Specialist with the Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS) unit in Maynard, Massachusetts. In the letter, which was dated March 9, 1990, Norman W. Winterowd, the appellant's second-line supervisor, reprimanded the appellant for his conduct on February 13, 1990. Specifically, Mr. Winterowd stated that the appellant ignored his request to move some furniture, and when asked why he had not moved the furniture, sprang from his chair and began swearing. The appellant filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the Board, asserting that the reprimand was issued in reprisal for protected whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge with the Board's Boston Regional Office granted the appellant's request for corrective action and reversed the letter of reprimand. The administrative judge found that during the week of February 7 through 13, 1990, the appellant reported security violations that allegedly occurred during a facility tour to Earl Henry, Chief, MERS, and the appellant's fourth-line supervisor. On March 26, 1990, the appellant complained to the agency's Office of Inspector General (IG) about the alleged security violations and asserted that William White, Chief, MERS Detachment, had violated leave procedures during the 1990 Christmas holidays. The administrative judge found that the agency stipulated that the appellant's reports of perceived security and leave violations constituted protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that his disclosures were a contributing factor to the issuance of the letter of reprimand. She cited Mr. Winterowd's testimony that shortly after the incident resulting in the reprimand, he attended a meeting with Mr. White. After Mr. White was called out of the meeting and informed about the appellant's report to Mr. Henry, Mr. White became upset and informed Mr. Winterowd that he wanted the appellant fired. She also noted that although Mr. Winterowd testified that he drafted the letter of reprimand on the Thursday following February 13, 1990, the letter was not issued to the appellant until April 11, 1990, the date the IG began its investigation into the allegations of leave and security violations. The administrative judge noted that Mr. Winterowd admitted that he possibly could have known of the IG's visit a few days before it took place and that the leave violations impugned his management practices. She found suspect his assertion that he did not know the source of the disclosures about leave violations because he had discussed leave policy with the appellant on February 5, 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that based on the timing of events, Mr. Winterowd's concern with the leave violations, and Mr. White's concern with the security violations, the appellant had shown by preponderant evidence that his disclosures were a contributing factor to the issuance of the letter of reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge then found that the agency failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that retaliation was not a factor in its decision to issue the letter of reprimand. In this regard, she found that the agency had not proven that the appellant failed to obey an order as stated in the letter of reprimand. She found that Mr. Winterowd admitted that he did not give the appellant a direct order to move furniture, the other employee who was present simply left the room without moving any furniture and apparently received no discipline for his actions, and Mr. Winterowd testified that the appellant helped him move the furniture after his outburst. She found that these facts coupled with the timing of the disclosures and the discipline impugned the agency's allegation that the letter of reprimand was not issued in retaliation. In addition, she noted Mr. Winterowd's admission that the appellant's outburst was out of character and the lack of evidence that the appellant had a prior disciplinary record, finding that the agency had failed to show that the reprimand would have been issued absent the protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the facts of this case, we agree with the agency that the administrative judge erred in finding that corrective action was warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who brings an IRA must show by preponderant evidence that retaliation was a contributing factor in the action taken against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDaid v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 46 MSPR <span id="Page_3996"></span>416, 420 (1990); <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 659 (1990). We find that the appellant has not sustained his burden of showing that his disclosure concerning alleged security violations during the tour was a contributing factor to the issuance of the reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the administrative judge erred in making her finding because the evidence shows that Mr. Winterowd decided to issue the letter of reprimand before his meeting with Mr. White, and thus before he knew of the appellant's protected disclosure to Mr. Henry. In this regard, it argues that the administrative judge erred in describing the timing of events of February 13, 1990. Specifically, it contends that the administrative judge misstated Mr. Winterowd's testimony concerning the timing of events by finding that he testified that shortly after the incident, which occurred around 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on February 13, 1990, he attended a meeting with Mr. White. It asserts that Mr. Winterowd testified that the incident occurred earlier, and that before his meeting with Mr. White, he went to his office to determine what disciplinary action was appropriate for the abusive language used by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Winterowd's February 13, 1990, memorandum for the record supports the agency's assertion that he had formed the intent to issue the letter of reprimand before the meeting. Although there is no time notation on the memorandum, it addresses only the incident, without mentioning any meeting, and concludes, "I fully intend to write a letter of reprimand to Bob Charest concerning his conduct this morning [after I cool down]." The conclusion that Mr. Winterowd decided to issue the letter of reprimand before his meeting with Mr. White is also buttressed by his preparation of a separate memorandum for record, also dated February 13, 1990, which discusses the meeting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that this memorandum shows that Mr. Winterowd knew of the appellant's protected disclosure before he actually wrote the final draft of the letter of reprimand, which bears a date of March 9, 1990. Moreover, Mr. Winterowd admitted that he did not begin drafting the reprimand until a couple of days after the February 13, 1990, incident. However, the Board has held that persisting in discipline decided upon before learning of protected disclosures does not, by itself, transform the discipline into a prohibited personnel practice. There is nothing in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) that requires a supervisor to change a decision once he learns that the employee has engaged in whistleblowing<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 MSPR 595, 605 (1991). Thus, we cannot find that Mr. Winterowd's subsequent steps to implement a decision he made before learning of the appellant's protected disclosures establish that the protected disclosures were a contributing factor to the appellant's reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the record indicates that Mr. Winterowd had knowledge before the incident on February 13, 1990, that the appellant was contemplating a protected disclosure. In a memorandum for record dated February 12, 1990, Mr. Winterowd stated that he had been informed that the appellant was concerned about the building tours and had been talking about "letting Earl Henry know." However, the record does not show that Mr. Winterowd had any motive for retaliating for these disclosures. He testified that security was not in his "domain" and that he had already discussed tour security with Mr. Henry, the person to whom the appellant allegedly made the disclosure. Moreover, he also testified that when he was directed to inquire about whether the appellant had made such a disclosure, both Mr. Henry and the appellant denied that the appellant had done so. Evidently, it was not until October 1991, that Mr. Winterowd learned that he had made a disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find no reason for discrediting Mr. Winterowd's explanation that the delay between his decision to reprimand the appellant and its actual issuance resulted from the need to have the agency's Offices of Employee Relations and Legal Counsel review the letter of reprimand. The administrative judge stated that if the review of the reprimand letter did not have to be done as one was not done for an earlier letter of warning the appellant received, the reprimand would most likely have been issued close to the warning on February 13, 1990. She also noted the rather long delay and found the timing of the reprimand's issuance significant since it was given on the day the IG's inspector came. However, she did not specifically state that she did not believe that the reprimand was sent for review. Thus, we find no reason for discrediting Mr. Winterowd's testimony on this point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if the appellant shows that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the action taken against him, the Board will not order corrective action if the agency shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDaid</span>, 46 MSPR at 421....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant swore at Mr. Winterowd during the incident on February 13, 1990....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long recognized that disrespectful conduct and abusive language are proper bases for imposing discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hubble v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 MSPB 553, 6 MSPR 659, 661 (1981). Here, Mr. Winterowd testified that he consulted the agency's table of penalties and found that the least action he could take was a reprimand. The record supports a finding that a reprimand was the lightest discipline set forth in the agency's table of penalties for a first offense of abusive language. Because the record shows that the agency had a non-retaliatory reason for disciplining the appellant and that the letter of reprimand was a reasonable penalty, we find that the agency has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action even absent the appellant's protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rychen v. Department of the Army</span>, 51 MSPR 179, 183-85 (1991); <span class="Italic">McDaid</span>, 46 MSPR at 423-24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the appellant had engaged in protected activity does not prevent the agency from imposing discipline where appropriate and reasonable to the offense. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1988) (expressing Congress' concern for "allowing agencies to appropriately sanction employees where whistleblowing was not a material factor in the personnel action"). Thus, we conclude that the additional fact that the appellant's coworker was not disciplined for his failure to follow an order, which was unaccompanied by the abusive language the appellant displayed, does not defeat the agency's proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board can retreat from the notion that a well-founded basis for removal automatically negates a reprisal charge. In <span class="Italic">Braga v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 392, 399(1992), the appellant was removed for substandard performance, but the appellant alleged that the removal was motivated by his complaints about improper directives concerning his work--directives that presented a threat to public safety. The Board remanded for further analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...That the agency proved, by substantial evidence, that the appellant's performance was unacceptable during the improvement period is insufficient by itself to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action in the absence of his disclosures.[6] An analysis of this issue must take into consideration that, "when it comes to proving the basis for an agency's decision, the agency controls most of the cards--the drafting of the documents supporting the decision, the testimony of witnesses who participated in the decision, and the records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases." 135 Cong. Rec. H747 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. Sikorski). In evaluating whether the agency met its heightened burden of proof, the administrative judge should therefore have considered the strength of the agency's evidence that the appellant's performance was unacceptable, as well as the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who participated in the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This is not to say that, where an appellant proves by preponderant evidence that a whistleblowing disclosure was a contributing <span id="Page_3997"></span>factor in a personnel action taken against him, an administrative judge must readjudicate the merits of that personnel action under the clear and convincing standard of proof. The statute rather requires that the agency "demonstrate[] by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of [the whistleblowing] disclosure." 5 USC 1221(e)(2).</p>

The administrative judge, relying solely on his earlier finding that the appellant was not performing at an acceptable level of competence at the end of the waiting period, held that the agency had met its burden of showing that it would have withheld the appellant's within-grade increase in the absence of his whistleblowing. This holding was erroneous, and we therefore VACATE it. The fact that "the agency proved, by substantial evidence, that the appellant's performance was unacceptable during [the period upon which a performance-based action was based] is insufficient by itself to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action in the absence of his disclosures." <span class="Italic">Braga v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 392, 399 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 6 F.3d 787 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table) (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the agency showed, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have withheld the appellant's within-grade increase in the absence of his whistleblowing, the administrative judge should have considered the following factors: The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its decision to withhold the appellant's within-grade increase, <span class="Italic">see Braga</span>, 54 MSPR at 399; "the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of agency officials" who were involved in the decision, <span class="Italic">id</span>.; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated, <span class="Italic">cf. McDaid v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 421 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith</span>, in turn, was followed in <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 241 (1995) (the removal of an OIG agent: "Thus, because the record shows that the agency had a non-retaliatory reason for disciplining the appellant and that removal was a reasonable penalty here, even in light of the fact that some of the agency's charges have not been sustained, we find that the agency has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action even absent the appellant's protected disclosures."). Again the Board intoned in <span class="Italic">Caddell v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 347, 351-52 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 96 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1996), declining to find reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the agency showed, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing, the Board considers the following factors: The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision, and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 66 (1994); <span class="Italic">Braga v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 392, 399 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 6 F.3d 787 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). We find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the agency met its burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant was reassigned because he was a manager who was perceived as being deeply involved in the interpersonal problems in the district, and agency officials believed that allowing him to remain would be seen as a victory for one faction over the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as the administrative judge correctly found, the agency officials who were involved in the decision to reassign the appellant had no motive to retaliate against him, and the appellant's disclosures were not directed at those individuals. The agency was in the process of trying to effect Cox's resignation based on his apparent wrongdoing, and took a "supportive position" by informing the appellant that he should provide such information to the inspector general. Mead had even cautioned Cox regarding engaging in conduct that either constituted or had the appearance of constituting retaliation against the appellant. Mead testified that his letter to Cox was intended to inform Cox that "we were not going to tolerate [Cox] violating any of [the appellant's] rights and we were not going to violate any of [the appellant's] rights on [Cox's] behalf."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency reassigned three other employees, including Dumaine, from the Tampa office who were not whistleblowers, but who were otherwise similarly situated to the appellant in that they were perceived to have had contributed to the divisiveness in the office. The record contains evidence that the agency had made reassignments in other district offices when there were management problems similar to those in the Tampa office, and there is no indication that the individuals who were reassigned in those districts were whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet, if the issue is the propriety of a proposed removal, the agency's clear and convincing evidence is not established by a charge that was not encompassed by the proposal, <span class="Italic">Scoggins v. Dept. of Army</span>, 123 MSPR 592, 614 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 45-46, 2016 MSPB 32 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues on review that it showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have proposed the appellant's removal absent his protected disclosures because his removal from the Unescorted Access Program (UAP) alone warranted his removal. The agency contends that the requirements for removing the appellant based on a charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment were clearly met in this case because his position description states that a UAP is required to maintain his position, and he admitted that he lost his UAP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, however, did not charge the appellant with failure to maintain a condition of employment. It is well established that the Board will not sustain an agency action on the basis of a charge that could have been brought but was not. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 8 (2011). Consequently, the appellant's alleged failure to maintain a condition of employment does not provide a basis for disturbing the administrative judge's findings concerning the strength of the evidence in support of the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Clear and convincing evidence was presented to support the removal of an employee who became disruptive in the workplace, <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Dept. of Army</span>, 89 MSPR 589, 636 &#x00B6; 90 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find that the nature of the charges provided strong support for the agency's decision to select removal as the appropriate penalty in this case. The facts upon which the agency's charges and specifications were based suggested that the appellant's relationship with her supervisors was adversarial and that her attitude toward the workplace had deteriorated to the point where she had become disrespectful, intentionally disruptive, physically abusive, and discourteous, even to those co-workers who had no connection to any of the allegedly retaliatory personnel actions the agency imposed on the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Caddell,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 351 (in assessing the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its reassignment of an agency manager, the Board considered the fact that the manager was deeply involved in the interpersonal problems in the district). In addition, neither the agency nor the appellant identified another agency employee who committed the type of misconduct involved in this case. Thus, there is no evidence showing that the agency treated the appellant any differently than it treats similarly situated employees who are not whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 78 &#x00B6; 26 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 242 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Greve v. DHHS</span>, DE-1221-15-0329-W-1 (NP 2/10/2016), considered but did not credit the appellant's assertion that the speech leading to her discipline was constitutionally protected, that is, that the protected nature of the speech detracted from the clear and convincing evidence that the agency maintained supported discipline based on that speech:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant's constitutional arguments might be construed as contesting the strength of the evidence in support of the agency's action, we find they are without merit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency did not violate the appellant's rights under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has clarified that Government employees retain their First Amendment right, as citizens, to comment on matters of public interest; the task in a particular case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the employees in commenting on matters of public concern and the interest of the Government, as employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968). The threshold question in applying this balancing test is whether the affected employee's speech may be "fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern," i.e., whether it addresses items of "political, social, or other concern to the community," as opposed to internal agency grievances. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Small Business Administration</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 137, 145 (1989). Here, the verbal conduct for which the appellant was suspended did not amount to speech on a matter of public concern, and her First Amendment interest therefore gives way to the Government's legitimate interest in the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Curry v. Department of the Navy,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. 327, 331 (1982) (observing that employee speech that lacks a public dimension and is seen as subversive to good order, efficiency, or discipline in the workplace, is more likely to be held unprotected than speech that is more public in character)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, CH-1221-11-0328-W-1 (NP 1/22/2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 581 Fed. Appx. 855 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP)), determined that misconduct overcame potential reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant and her supervisor had an antagonistic working relationship, for which both of them bore significant responsibility. Several of the appellant's colleagues reported that she consistently bad-mouthed her supervisor, sometimes using foul language, and that she sought to intimidate them. Although the administrative judge found that the appellant's supervisor exhibited an obvious bias against the appellant, and therefore discounted some of the agency's evidence as a result, she found that the strength of the remaining documentary evidence, as well as her assessment of the credibility of the testimony before her, indicated that the agency would have removed the appellant despite her whistleblowing disclosures. The appellant provides no reason on review to upset this determination. <span id="Page_3998"></span>Moreover, the record does not reflect that the tension in the appellant's relationship with her supervisors was a result of her allegedly protected disclosures or that the appellant's unprofessional behavior might never have occurred but for the agency's actions in allegedly creating a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Cf., Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 31 (2013)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The strength of an agency's evidence in support of its adverse action was dispositive of a reprisal claim, <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 98, 115-16 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether the agency has established, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken its personnel action even absent the appellant's protected disclosures, the Board will consider the following criteria: (1) The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar action against employees who are not whistleblowers, but who are otherwise similarly situated<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 363, 370 (1997); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 666, 672-73 (1997); <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, 66 MSPR at 351; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 66 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brewer</span> and <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, the Board applied only the first two criteria in its "clear and convincing" analysis. In <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, it found that the agency failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have given the appellant unsatisfactory performance ratings, even absent his whistleblowing, because (1) the appellant's supervisor could not identify any specific aspects of the appellant's performance that caused him to rate him as he did, and (2) the rating officials were the subjects of the appellant's protected disclosures<span class="Italic">. See Brewer</span>, 76 MSPR at 370-71. In <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, the Board found that the agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the appellant, even absent his protected disclosures, where the evidence established that (1) the appellant was deeply involved in the interpersonal problems of a factionalized office; and (2) his disclosures were not directed at the officials who reassigned him<span class="Italic">. See Caddell</span>, 66 MSPR at 351-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Degraaff v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 73 MSPR 224 (1997), the Board resolved the appellant's individual right of action (IRA) claim, which the administrative judge incorrectly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, solely on the basis of the first criterion, i.e., the strength of the agency's evidence supporting its action. There, the Board found that, even if the appellant were to meet the "contributing factor" standard, the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action, even absent the appellant's whistleblowing, where the evidence established that the appellant left his assigned workplace without informing his supervisor, and did not return to work until more than ten days later. <span class="Italic">See Degraaff,</span> 73 MSPR at 230.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the dispositive factor in this case is the strength of the agency's evidence supporting its removal action. The agency proved the following charges: (1) Undermining the credibility of the safety program; (2) engaging in threatening and retaliatory behavior; (3) failing to carry out assigned work; (4) insubordinate defiance of authority; and (5) performing unauthorized activities while purportedly incapacitated for duty. There is no question but that the sustained misconduct was serious. Further, we have reviewed the record evidence supporting these charges, and we agree with the administrative judge's assessment that the evidence supporting the sustained charges, and consequently, its personnel action, was overwhelming.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our review of the record has not disclosed any evidence that the agency imposes the penalty of removal on similarly-situated employees who are not whistleblowers but who engage in equally serious misconduct. Nevertheless, the lack of such evidence is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brewer,</span> 76 MSPR at 370-71; <span class="Italic">Degraaff,</span> 73 MSPR at 230; <span class="Italic">Caddell,</span> 66 MSPR at 351-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we conclude that the evidence of retaliatory motive in this case is insufficient to outweigh the evidence supporting the agency's removal action. Accordingly, we further conclude, on the basis of the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action, that the agency has established, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action, even absent the appellant's protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Degraaff,</span> 73 MSPR at 230.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Various factors, including the strength of the agency's reasons for taking action against the appellant, ascertained by the Board to have been perceived as a whistleblower, served to avoid a finding of whistleblower reprisal, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCARTHY_ROBERT_JOHN_DA_1221_09_0725_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_628714.pdf">116 MSPR 594</a>, 613-26 &#x00B6; 31-33, 37-67, 2011 MSPB 74 (2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, 497 Fed. Appx. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, however, we find that full and fair consideration of the appellant's claims requires adjudication of both the merits of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as well as the agency's affirmative defense. The Board has stated that, in determining whether the agency would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of a protected disclosure, it considers, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision. <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 29; <span class="Italic">see Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Because direct evidence of a deciding official's retaliatory motive is rare, appellants are entitled to rely on circumstantial evidence giving rise to an inference of impermissible intent. <span class="Italic">Fellhoelter,</span> 568 F.3d at 971; <span class="Italic">see Webster v. Department of the Army,</span> 911 F.2d 679, 689-90 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">see also Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001). As our reviewing court recognized in <span class="Italic">Fellhoelter,</span> in some cases, "evidence of retaliatory motive [may also be] relevant to the [appellant's] <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; for example, evidence of an employee's assertions of misconduct by a supervisor can be relevant to whether the employee has made a protected disclosure and also whether the supervisor has a strong motivation to retaliate." 568 F.3d at 971<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed below, in this case, the circumstantial evidence bearing on retaliatory motive includes the substance of the appellant's allegedly protected activity as well as the extent to which the deciding official was aware of it. Thus, resolution of both the merits of the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency's affirmative defense is required. We can make these determinations at this level, however, because the appellant has established jurisdiction over his whistleblower claim, a hearing has been conducted, and the evidence of record is complete. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-26 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant established by preponderant evidence that he was perceived as a whistleblower and that he made a protected disclosure</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One who is perceived as a whistleblower is entitled to the protection of the WPA, even if he has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 11 n.3 (2007); <span class="Italic">Juffer v. U.S. Information Agency,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 12 (1998). Commissioner Ruth testified that he was responsible for hiring the appellant in January 2009, and that he decided to hire the appellant knowing that the appellant had previously filed whistleblower disclosures regarding his previous employer, the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, as stated above, in his July 28, 2009, email to Commissioner Ruth, the appellant "assert[ed his] rights as a protected whistleblower" on the grounds that he had "report[ed] allegations of fraud, waste and abuse...to the State Department [OIG], the FBI, and/or other appropriate entities." Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant was perceived as a whistleblower.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also disclosed that the agency purportedly issued a bid solicitation for levee construction under the Recovery Act based on design specifications prepared by a design firm with which the agency had no contractual relationship. He contended that "[I]n the event of flaws in the design, especially latent flaws," the agency would be exposed to liability but would have "limited if any third party recourse." We find that in making this disclosure, the appellant, at a minimum, disclosed a matter that he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, which was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i). In particular, the appellant has shown that this disclosure exposed a potential violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 C.F.R., part 46, relating to quality assurance in government contracting. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 508 F.3d 674, 676-78 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding section 2302(b)(8)(b) may be satisfied by a disclosure of a violation of the FAR); <span class="Italic">Schnell,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 20. We find that the appellant was in a position to reasonably believe his disclosure because, as part of his duties as a Supervisory Attorney for the agency, he analyzed the issue and expressed his concerns. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kalil v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 77, &#x00B6; 16 (2004) (considering the appellant's status as an attorney in determining whether he had made a nonfrivolous allegation that he reasonably believed his disclosure). In making this determination, however, we do not find that the appellant actually established a regulatory violation, but only that he met his burden of establishing that the matter disclosed was one which a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced such a violation. <span class="Italic">See Schnell,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 839 F.3d 97, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">see also Weber v. Department of the Army,</span> 9 F.3d 97, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("In general, the WPA does not give the Board the right to review the substance of whistleblowing claims."). Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In appropriate cases, the Board should consider, with respect to each purported disclosure, whether the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that he made a disclosure that he reasonably believed evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). This is particularly appropriate in cases in which the substance of the appellant's disclosures is also relevant to the deciding official's motive to retaliate for having made them. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chambers,</span> <span id="Page_3999"></span>116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 58-69. In view of our determination that the appellant established that he was perceived as a whistleblower and that he established that he made a protected disclosure, it is not necessary to do so here with respect to his remaining disclosures. As discussed below, although the appellant advised Commissioner Ruth in his email of July 28, 2009 of the fact that he had made purported disclosures, there is no evidence in the record that Ruth knew the details contained within the appellant's written disclosures themselves prior to the time that he terminated the appellant on July 31. Therefore, in this case, the substance of the disclosures themselves has no bearing on our determination regarding whether the appellant was terminated in reprisal for whistleblowing activity. Rather, under these circumstances, the relevant consideration for the Board is whether the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that his perceived status as a whistleblower, including the agency's knowledge of the fact that he made purported disclosures, was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to terminate the appellant, and, if so, whether the agency met its burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the appellant's perceived status. <span class="Italic">See Juffer,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 18. Thus, under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that an exhaustive analysis of each of the appellant's remaining disclosures is not necessary to the Board's adjudication of the merits of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To obtain corrective action, the appellant must meet his initial burden of establishing by preponderant evidence that his whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action in dispute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Rubendall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 11 (2006). Whistleblowing is a contributing factor if it affects an agency's decision to threaten, propose, take, or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(c). To prove that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action, the appellant need only demonstrate that <span class="Italic">the fact of,</span> not necessarily the content of, the protected disclosure was one of the factors that tended to affect the personnel action in any way. <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see Marano v. Department of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a 1994 amendment to the WPA, Congress established a knowledge/timing test that allows an employee to demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action "knew of the disclosure," and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see Perkins v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 250, &#x00B6; 13 (2005). Although the knowledge/timing test is not the only way for an appellant to satisfy the contributing factor standard, it is "one of the many possible ways" to satisfy the standard. <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 12. Once the knowledge/timing test has been met, the appellant has shown that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue, even if after a complete analysis of all of the evidence a reasonable fact finder could not conclude that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the appellant "assert[ed his] rights as a whistleblower" in his July 28, 2009 email to the Commissioner on the grounds that he had "report[ed] allegations of fraud, waste and abuse...to the State Department [OIG], the FBI, and/or other appropriate entities." Although there is no evidence in the record that Commissioner Ruth knew the details contained within the appellant's written disclosures, the fact that the appellant told him that he had made the disclosures is sufficient to establish the "knowledge" element of the knowledge/timing test. <span class="Italic">Marano,</span> 2 F.3d at 1143; <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">see also Mausser,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 44-45 (even though the appellant never revealed purported disclosures to any authority, the contributing factor test would be satisfied if the deciding official was aware that the appellant had threatened to make the disclosures and thus perceived him as a whistleblower). Furthermore, the length of time between the appellant's disclosure and the agency's decision to terminate him--3 days--is sufficiently proximate that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the termination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 13 (an interval of less than 6 months between the disclosure and the personnel action was sufficient to satisfy the knowledge/timing test); <span class="Italic">but see Costello v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 182 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (a 2-year gap between the disclosures and the allegedly retaliatory action was too long an interval to justify an inference of cause and effect between the two).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, the appellant has satisfied the knowledge/timing test and, thus, has established that the fact of his disclosure, and, consequently, his perceived whistleblower status, was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action. As a result, the burden of proof shifts to the agency to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Juffer,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 18. Any contrary evidence regarding a contributing factor may be considered in the context of the agency's clear and convincing evidence. <span class="Italic">Wadhwa v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 13 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant established that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the contested personnel action, the Board will order corrective action unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), (2); <span class="Italic">see Schneider v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 18 (2005). Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established; it is a higher standard than preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d) (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323; <span class="Italic">Azbill,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 17. The Board does not view these factors as discrete elements, each of which the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence. Rather, the Board will weigh the factors together to determine whether the evidence is clear and convincing as a whole. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Transportation,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 11 (2010); <span class="Italic">see Yunus v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we find, based on the knowledge/timing test, that appellant's protected whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in his termination, we agree with the administrative judge's determination in the appellant's termination appeal that the agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the appellant absent his protected activity. Here, the administrative judge's findings on the charges are based either on undisputed facts or, in significant part, on his assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. The appellant has not presented sound reasons for us to revisit those credibility determinations or the resultant findings. In this regard, we note that the Board "is not free simply to disagree with an administrative judge's assessment of credibility." <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy,</span> 38 F.3d 563, 566 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Rather, it must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations where, as here, they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">accord Walker v. Department of the Army,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 13 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">When applying the first Carr</span> factor, the Board will consider the weight of the evidence that was before the agency when it acted. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 12. Here, the administrative judge, based on a detailed discussion of the evidence and a thorough and persuasively reasoned analysis, was satisfied that the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing established that Commissioner Ruth terminated the appellant because "he was frustrated with the appellant's incorrect legal advice and his contentious, divisive memoranda," and that "although the appellant's whistleblowing disclosures coincided, either by chance or by design, with the end of the degenerating relationship between himself and Ruth, they did not cause the deterioration." We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, the administrative judge credited Commissioner Ruth's testimony that he hired the appellant in January 2009, but that within about 3 months of hiring the appellant, he became concerned about the quality of the appellant's legal advice. Ruth testified that he first became concerned in or around April 2009 when he reviewed exchanges of emails between the appellant and other executive staff members that Ruth deemed to be inappropriate and unprofessional. He further testified that in May 2009, in response to a question about the agency's monitoring of computers, the appellant wrote a memorandum urging that the agency's information technology (IT) staff be reorganized so that they would report directly to the Commissioner. Ruth testified that he found the recommendation to be "strange" and unreasonable, that he approached the State Department OIG to ask for guidance on whether the current IT organizational structure required a change, and that OIG told him that the appellant's advice was incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4000"></span>Ruth further testified that in May 2009, the appellant prepared and issued a memorandum giving the opinion that Ruth's appointment to the position of Commissioner was unconstitutional and invalid. Ruth said that he sought legal advice from the State Department, and that, in the State Department's opinion, the appellant was again wrong. <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth also testified that in June 2009, the appellant issued a memorandum that addressed the organizational structure under the agency's Chief Administrative Officer, Diana Forti. Ruth characterized the memorandum as attacking Forti personally, asserting that she was a "mid-level administrator who does not possess these core competencies." Ruth testified that this memorandum was inappropriate, in part, because it was disseminated to all of the agency's executive staff without first providing Ruth an opportunity to review it. He stated that senior staff reacted with "a lot of resentment" because the memorandum raised questions about their competence, and that the memorandum contained the same information that the appellant had presented about the IT organization, which had been found to be incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth further testified that the appellant issued a second memorandum in June 2009 which addressed matters for which the Commissioner had made no request, and that this memorandum, too, was sent to all of the executive staff simultaneously, without providing Ruth the opportunity to review or approve its contents. Ruth asserted that he was concerned about the memorandum because it accused the agency of "gross mismanagement" by failing to adopt the organizational recommendations of the OIG. Ruth stated that he was frustrated with the appellant because the memorandum recommended dramatic organizational changes in apparent ignorance of the fact that the agency's organizational structure had already been modified to comply with the OIG's recommendation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth further testified that he was disturbed by an additional memorandum issued by the appellant on July 14, 2009, concerning the appellant's review of proposed revisions to the agency's internal audit program. Ruth stated that the appellant's memorandum again harshly criticized another agency employee personally, labeling him as incompetent and unethical, and recommended organizational changes that stripped that employee of virtually all his responsibilities and reassigned them either to the appellant himself or to other managers. Ruth testified that the appellant's memorandum was "upsetting" because it was again issued without providing Ruth the opportunity to review it and that it went beyond simply commenting on the proposed revisions and presented extreme recommendations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth explained that the appellant's June 2009 memoranda undermined one of his central objectives, to create a cohesive staff that could work together effectively to advance the agency's mission, because the memoranda were divisive and generated discord among the executive staff. He also stated that the memoranda resulted in a grievance complaining of the appellant's "bullying" behavior as "intimidating and a clear demonstration of his abuse of power as the agency's legal advisor."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth further testified that, during the staff meeting on Monday, July 27, 2009, during which the appellant asserted that he was being excluded from the meetings of the Recovery Act oversight committee, Ruth made the firm decision that he would terminate the appellant--that "enough was enough," he was done with the appellant's contentiousness and attacks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also contains ample evidence that Ruth's concerns about the appellant's job performance predated the appellant's July 28, 2009 email claiming protected whistleblower status, thus indicating that the agency's stated concerns about the appellant were not mere pretext. <span class="Italic">See Phillips,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 20. For example, Brandt testified that, in mid-May 2009, during Ruth's visit to Washington D.C., Ruth showed her the appellant's memorandum questioning the legality of Ruth's appointment and expressed concerns to her about the appellant's work performance. Brandt also testified that in late June 2009, she again talked to Ruth about two other memoranda written by the appellant, and that Ruth told her that the appellant was not a good fit for the agency, that he was not "a team player," that he regretted hiring the appellant, and that Ruth was considering terminating him<span class="Italic">.</span> She testified that Ruth showed her the SF-50 for the appellant's appointment and asked whether he could terminate the appellant "without cause" or on the basis of the June 2009 memoranda. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Brandt stated that Ruth asked her if there was someone in the State Department's legal offices that could provide employment law advice. Brandt indicated that the same day she met with Ruth in June 2009, she talked to the State Department's Deputy Director for Employment Law, Richard Visek, and asked him if he could assist Ruth. Brandt said that Visek agreed to provide help and she provided the contact information to Ruth.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth testified that he actually began drafting the appellant's termination letter on July 18, 2009, ten days prior to the date upon which the appellant notified him that he had made allegedly protected disclosures. As the administrative judge recognized, the agency's computer meta-data corroborates Ruth's testimony,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth further testified that on July 20, 2009, he spoke with Human Resources Director Kevin Petz about the damaging effects of the appellant's behavior on Ruth's efforts to unify the agency's managers, and told Petz that he needed information about how to terminate the appellant. Although Petz testified that he did not remember the exact date of his conversation with Ruth, he stated that it might have occurred on July 20 or 21, 2009. Petz testified that Ruth entered his office and told him that he was thinking about terminating the appellant, and that during this conversation, Ruth stated that he wanted information about the procedures for terminating the appellant and what rights the appellant had. Petz also testified that he offered to obtain this information. Thus, Petz's hearing testimony corroborates Ruth's testimony in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth testified that it was not until he traveled to Washington D.C. on July 29, 2009, that he was actually able to talk to Visek and a State Department personnel specialist. Ruth testified that he did not remember exactly when he received the appellant's July 28th email claiming to have made disclosures of fraud, waste and abuse, but he assumed it was in his possession when he got to Washington D.C. Ruth stated that Visek advised him that he could terminate the appellant with a letter and that the appellant could not appeal the termination because he had less than 1 year of service. Ruth stated that he was advised to simply present the appellant with a written notice of the termination and to not discuss the action. Ruth testified that the first draft of the termination letter was considerably longer than the notice he actually delivered to the appellant on July 31, 2009, but that Ruth had revised it after the State Department attorneys advised him to make it "short and to the point."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Ruth and Brandt testified that, while Ruth was in Washington D.C., Ruth had a meeting with the OIG because of the appellant's July 28th email claiming that he had filed, or would soon file, allegations of fraud, waste and abuse. Ruth explained that he wanted the OIG to know that he intended to proceed with the termination action. Ruth and Brandt testified that, at the time of the meeting, Ruth had not seen the appellant's memorandum of disclosures, nor did he have any indication what they were. Brandt also testified that the IG stated that his office had not received any disclosures from the appellant but that they would follow up with any disclosures filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ruth and Petz's testimony establishes that upon his return to El Paso, Ruth called Petz to set up a time to meet with the appellant. Both Ruth and Petz described the meeting on July 31, 2009, with the appellant as very brief, and that Ruth stated that he simply announced to the appellant that he had a letter notifying him that he was being terminated and that it was not negotiable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusions that "Ruth's dissatisfaction with the appellant was corroborated by Brandt, with whom he confided, and from whom he sought referrals for government employment law advice because he could not get advice from his own lawyer, whom he sought to fire. Ruth's endeavor to get advice on how to remove the appellant began in May 2009 and continued at every opportunity until the termination notice was delivered." There is nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) that required Ruth to change his decision once he learned that the appellant had made his disclosures. <span class="Italic">See O'Shea v. Department of Transportation,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 512, 515 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues extensively about the quality of his work and the basis for his belief in the truthfulness of the allegations set forth in his disclosures. However, in an IRA appeal, the relevant inquiry is not whether the appellant committed any actual misconduct, but whether the agency had strong evidence to support its personnel action. <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Yunus,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant also argues that "[n]ot coincidentally, each of the four [memoranda] in question deals with a significant aspect of fraud, waste or abuse included in [his] July 28 protected disclosures." As our reviewing court has recognized, however, "[t]he WPA is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct." <span class="Italic">LaChance,</span> 174 F.3d at 1381. Thus, the fact that the appellant's disclosures concerned the matters addressed in his legal memoranda did not foreclose Ruth from considering the memoranda in determining to terminate the appellant. The evidence as a whole supports a finding that the appellant's conduct was problematic under the circumstances. For all these reasons, we find that the agency had a strong basis for directing the appellant's termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Motive to Retaliate</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When applying the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the Board will consider any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency official who ordered the action, as well as any motive to retaliate on the part of other agency officials who influenced the decision. <span class="Italic">See Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1326; <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 30 (2008). In this case, the relevant agency officials are Commissioner Ruth, who issued the termination letter, as well as Brandt and Petz, whom the Commissioner consulted about the termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, Commissioner Ruth testified that before he hired <span id="Page_4001"></span>the appellant, he was aware that the appellant had worked for the Department of the Interior and that the appellant had previously filed whistleblower disclosures regarding the Department of the Interior. Ruth testified that he decided to hire the appellant knowing of his history as a whistleblower. We agree with the administrative judge that, under these circumstances, "the mere act of making disclosures, regardless of their substance, does not appear to be a motive for Ruth to retaliate." In addition, there is no evidence that Commissioner Ruth or Brandt was aware of the particulars of the disclosures at the time the appellant was terminated. Indeed, in his July 28, 2009 memorandum to the State Department's OIG setting forth his disclosures, the appellant expressly stated that that "these disclosures should not be referred to the Commissioner." Thus, the substance of the disclosures themselves could not have constituted a motive for Ruth to retaliate. Therefore, we find that, to the extent that the appellant's July 28, 2009 email to the Commissioner created a retaliatory motive for Commissioner Ruth, that motive was slight. Furthermore, to the extent that Commissioner Ruth consulted Brandt or Petz concerning the appellant's termination, as discussed above, those consultations occurred prior to the time the appellant made his disclosures. Thus, to the extent that Brandt or Petz could be deemed agency officials who influenced the decision, neither Brandt not Petz had a motive to retaliate against the appellant because of his disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering all of the evidence, although there was some motive on the part of Commissioner Ruth to retaliate against the appellant, in light of Ruth's lack of awareness of the particulars of the disclosures themselves, we find that his motive to retaliate was not strong. Accordingly, we find that the evidence of such motive does not outweigh the strength of the evidence in support of the agency's termination decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the record contains no evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. We agree with the administrative judge that Riera, who the appellant identified as a comparator employee, was not similarly situated. Accordingly, we find that the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is not a significant factor for the Board's analysis in the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weighing the three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors against one another, we find that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the appellant notwithstanding any protected disclosures. The primary decision-maker lacked a strong retaliatory motive, and the agency had a strong basis to terminate the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, notwithstanding the administrative judge's failure to make findings on first two prongs of the WPA analysis, he correctly found that the agency would have terminated the appellant notwithstanding his protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined that the Board properly assessed that evidence was sufficiently clear and convincing to rebut any inference of whistleblower reprisal in the termination of an attorney, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, 497 Fed. Appx. 4, 11-14 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McCarthy also contends that the record before us does not contain substantial evidence to support the Board's conclusion that the Commission proved by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. McCarthy would have been removed even in the absence of his protected disclosures. A "protected disclosure" is a disclosure which "an employee...reasonably believes evidences (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(a). To establish a protected disclosure under the WPA, an employee must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he disclosed information that he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Here, the parties do not dispute that Mr. McCarthy made what would qualify as protected disclosures. Moreover, the Commission does not contest the Board's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> determination that Mr. McCarthy's disclosures were a contributing factor in the Commission's decision to terminate his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee establishes as a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> matter that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the burden shifts to the agency to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action even in the absence of the protected disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">See Kewley v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 153 F.3d 1357, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In assessing whether an agency has met its burden, the Board looks at three factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers, but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Social Sec. Admin.,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Here, the Board determined that the Commission established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated Mr. McCarthy's position in the absence of his disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McCarthy attacks the evidence and the Board's reasoning with respect to all three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors. As to the strength of the Commission's evidence in support of its action, Mr. McCarthy contends that the Board erroneously deferred to the administrative judge's credibility determination. Specifically, Mr. McCarthy asserts that the testimony of both Mr. Riera and Mr. Petz undermines Commissioner Ruth's credibility by proving that the final decision to terminate Mr. McCarthy's employment was made <span class="Italic">after</span> his whistleblowing. According to Mr. McCarthy, an allegedly backdated memorandum purporting to justify his removal further undermines Commissioner Ruth's credibility. Additionally, Mr. McCarthy argues that the Commission has since embraced his reorganization opinions, thereby indicating that the tone and content of his opinions were not the true reasons he was fired. Mr. McCarthy also contends that because the content of his memoranda ultimately became the content of his whistleblowing disclosures, the Commission could not fire him for his memoranda.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we note that "[t]he WPA is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct." <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Mr. McCarthy's claim does not turn on the fact that the content of his protected disclosures overlapped with the content of his earlier memoranda. Moreover, we agree with the Board that "the question here is not ultimately whether the Commission or Mr. McCarthy was correct regarding their legal and policy difference," but whether the Commission had sufficiently strong evidence to support its personnel action. <span class="Italic">McCarthy,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. at 624 n.15. We conclude that it did. As previously discussed, the administrative judge credited Commissioner Ruth's testimony that, after considering the issue for some time before, it was Mr. McCarthy's behavior during the July 27, 2009 staff meeting that ultimately fixed his decision to terminate Mr. McCarthy. The administrative judge also credited Commissioner Ruth's testimony that, even before the disclosures, he "became concerned about the quality of [Mr. McCarthy's] legal advice," which he described as "strange" and "unreasonable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 630.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has "held that 'an evaluation of witness credibility is within the discretion of the Board and that, in general, such evaluations are "virtually unreviewable" on appeal."' <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> 618 F.3d at 1313 (citing<span class="Italic"> King v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 133 F.3d 1450, 1453 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Clark v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 997 F.2d 1466, 1473 (Fed. Cir. 1993))). We have further clarified that this credibility determination must be "based on observations of the demeanor of a testifying witness such that the administrative judge's findings were explicitly or implicitly based on such observation of demeanor." <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In this case, the administrative judge noted that Commissioner Ruth "testified in a straight-forward manner, without equivocation, about his reaction to appellant's behavior" and specifically based his credibility determination on Mr. McCarthy's demeanor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, a credibility determination may be upset if it is "inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed evidence or physical fact." <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 160 F.3d 722, 725-26 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Here, the evidence supports the Board's decision to defer to the administrative judge's credibility determination. Indeed, computer meta-data confirms that Commissioner Ruth began drafting the termination notice on July 18, 2009. Ms. Brandt, who testified that Commissioner Ruth discussed terminating Mr. McCarthy's employment as early as June 2009, further corroborated Commissioner Ruth's testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McCarthy's reliance on Mr. Riera's testimony to undermine Commissioner Ruth's credibility is misplaced. Regarding the decision to terminate Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Riera testified that on July 31, 2009, Commissioner Ruth stated that "I thought long and hard last night, and this is what I have to do, and I don't want to discuss it." But this testimony does not necessarily contradict Commissioner Ruth's testimony that he made the decision to remove Mr. McCarthy at the July 27, 2009 meeting. And in any event, the administrative judge resolved any inconsistency when he determined that Commissioner Ruth was a credible witness. Similarly, Mr. Petz's testimony that Commissioner Ruth had no intention of firing Mr. McCarthy as of July 24, 2009 is not inconsistent with Commissioner Ruth's testimony that he made his decision on July 27, 2009. It is true that Mr. Petz sent a personal email to Mr. McCarthy stating that he was surprised that Commissioner Ruth had fired him. This "surprise," however, is contradicted by Mr. Petz's own testimony that on or around July 20, 2009, he and Mr. Riera had been concerned about Commissioner Ruth's intentions of firing Mr. McCarthy and that he had counseled Mr. McCarthy to develop a better relationship with Commissioner Ruth. And as the Commission explained at oral argument, the allegedly backdated memorandum is not backdated at all. Instead, Commissioner Ruth created the memorandum at issue on August 2, 2009 as a record of a meeting that allegedly took place between Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Ruth on July 23, 2009--hence, the July 23, 2009 date noted in the memorandum. The Commission never asserted that the memorandum was actually created on July 23, 2009. At bottom, substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that the Commission had a strong basis for terminating Mr. McCarthy's employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4002"></span>Mr. McCarthy also contends that the Board's conclusions with respect to the second and third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors are not supported by substantial evidence. With respect to the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, Mr. McCarthy argues that the Board was wrong to conclude that his protected disclosures created only a slight motive to retaliate. As discussed above, the Board found that there was no evidence that Commissioner Ruth actually read Mr. McCarthy's disclosures before the Commission terminated Mr. McCarthy. But according to Mr. McCarthy, Commissioner Ruth must have known the general content of Mr. McCarthy's disclosures, especially in light of Mr. McCarthy's previous memoranda and his email informing Commissioner Ruth of the disclosures. With respect to the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the Board found no evidence that the Commission takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. Mr. McCarthy, however, contends that the Board should have weighed this factor more heavily against the Commission. Mr. McCarthy specifically argues that the Board failed to consider that two Commission employees, Mr. Graf and Ms. Forti, were similarly situated--yet they were not fired despite their allegedly divisive conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding Mr. McCarthy's contentions with respect to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors two and three, we agree with the Board that the ultimate inquiry is whether the Commission has carried its burden of providing clear and convincing evidence that the same action would have been taken absent the alleged whistleblowing. In <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor,</span> we explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Carr</span> does not impose an affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence with respect to each and every one of the three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors to weigh them each individually in the agency's favor. The factors are merely appropriate and pertinent considerations for determining whether the agency carries its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the same action would have been taken absent the whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">680 F.3d 1353, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Commission provided strong evidence in support of its personnel action. In particular, Commissioner Ruth testified that, after months of dissatisfaction, he made the ultimate decision to terminate Mr. McCarthy before the alleged whistleblowing occurred. Based on Commissioner Ruth's demeanor and extensive corroborating evidence, the administrative judge found this testimony credible. We see no reason to disturb that credibility determination on appeal. While in many cases an analysis of all three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors may be necessary to demonstrate what an agency would have done absent whistleblowing, in this case, the Commission has definitively established that it was actively working to remove Mr. McCarthy prior to his disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's ultimate determination that the Commission proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated Mr. McCarthy even in the absence of his disclosures.</p>

EPA</span>, 108 MSPR 296, 306-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-20, 2008 MSPB 51 (2008), analyzed the evidence in support of a suspension and concluded it was sufficiently clear and convincing to overcome the appellant's allegation of whistleblowing reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing the merits of an IRA appeal, the Board must examine whether the appellant established by preponderant evidence that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and that such whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action; if so, the Board must order corrective action unless the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(e), 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Powers,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">see Spencer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 327 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Army,</span> 997 F.2d 1466, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by statute as recognized in Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The Board may resolve these merits issues in any order it deems most efficient. <span class="Italic">See Rusin,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 20 n.9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find it most efficient to bypass the issue of whether the appellant established by preponderant evidence that he engaged in whistleblowing activity and that such activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue, and to proceed to the issue of whether the agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action--the 4-day suspension--absent the purported whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hood v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 12 (2004). Clear and convincing evidence "is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d) (noting that it is a higher standard than preponderant evidence). In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has provided clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent the appellant's disclosures. The agency has presented strong evidence in support of its decision to suspend the appellant based on the charges made against him. Specifically, the agency supported its charges by submitting copies of the e-mails that served as the basis for some of the specifications raised by the agency, as well as contemporaneous accounts of the incidents by the involved parties, including the appellant. The appellant has not contested the charges on appeal, conceding that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, while conversing with another co-worker, he referred to Gloria Owens as being a "bitch. In light of those factors, the agency's decision to suspend the appellant for 4 days was well-supported by the evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wilson v. Department of Justice,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 303, 310 (1995) (finding that disrespectful conduct manifested by the use of obscene, abusive language is unacceptable and not conducive to a stable working atmosphere, that an agency is entitled to expect employees to comport themselves in accordance with accepted standards, and that the Board has upheld the penalty of removal for such misconduct); <span class="Italic">see also Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1326 (noting that the WPA is not meant to protect employees from their own misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There also is no indication that any official that may have been involved in the decision to suspend the appellant had any motive to retaliate against him because of his disclosures. Among the appellant's purported disclosures at issue here, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> those disclosures pertaining to alleged agency violations of laws, rules, or regulations, we note that the disclosures address the actions of agency heads and other top-level agency managers, both within and outside of the appellant's agency, and only tangentially address the actions of the officials that were involved in the appellant's disciplinary action. We discern no indication from the record, apart from the appellant's speculation, of the existence of any motive to retaliate against the appellant on the part of the agency officials who were involved in his suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant has not identified any non-whistleblowers who were similarly situated but more favorably treated. Indeed, although the appellant repeatedly asserted in his purported disclosures that management misdeeds in recent years had caused many of his fellow college-degreed accountants to leave the agency, voluntarily or otherwise, he did not allege that the purported exodus was related to protected whistleblowing activity by those co-workers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the strength of the evidence in support of the appellant's 4-day suspension, the lack of evidence of a motive to retaliate, and the absence of any similarly situated non-whistleblowers, we find that the agency has established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have imposed a 4-day suspension absent the appellant's purported whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See Powers,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 28; <span class="Italic">Yunus,</span> 242 F.3d at 1372-73.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Board finding of clear and convincing evidence that an employee would have been removed by RIF despite whistleblowing was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Engler v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3234):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the RIF mandate was made to counter a reduction in workload at the Norfolk Navy Shipyard. When deciding which positions to eliminate, Engler's superiors sought to keep more engineers, as opposed to engineering technicians, because they performed most of the work in the department and because lower-grade nuclear engineers could perform tasks assigned to both their position and higher-grade technicians. As a result of their more limited use, all fourteen employees <span id="Page_4003"></span>in Engler's position were eliminated. The board held, and we agree, that there was clear and convincing evidence that the Navy would have separated Engler absent his disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A decision by the Board not to credit a whistleblowing reprisal defense in another RIF case was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3042). In <span class="Italic">Gray</span> the evidence was clear and convincing that the appellant would have been separated by RIF even if there was an element of reprisal. The RIF was nationwide. Evidence of a decreased need for appellant's expertise was shown. Another employee who engaged in work and disclosures comparable to appellant was not subjected to a RIF; a comparable employee was subjected to a RIF who did not engage in protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams-Moore v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3101) ("[E]liminating the Baylor Plan for an entire staff of almost thirty people strongly suggests that the action was not a reprisal against one individual.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that an appellant's position would not have been upgraded but for whistleblowing when the agency showed that the position was the subject of a classification audit and the employee's claim for upgrading was reviewed and declined by an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 83 MSPR 16, 22 &#x00B6; 11 &#x0026; n.2 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board can restrict the evidence it considers from an appellant who tries to rebut an agency's clear and convincing evidence. In <span class="Italic">SSA v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313, 337-38 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Carr v. SSA</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Board ruled that when the employee (an ALJ) was charged with a variety of offenses, evidence would be taken as to the conduct of another ALJ only if that judge "was alleged to have engaged in all of the misconduct that the respondent was charged with." The Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Carr</span> was essentially the same as that applied, under the law then extant, to a disparate penalty mitigation defense in an ordinary adverse action, severely restricting the employee in her efforts to prove the disparity defense by severely limiting the universe of comparable employees. If the Board is to properly implement a statutory allocation of proof in a whistleblowing case, it should examine the severity rather than the identity of charged conduct among employees holding similar positions. [Refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-081.html#sec7-80">Same Work Unit; Evolving Case Law: Earlier Decisions of <span class="Italic">Woebcke; Lewis</span></a>," for evolving case law broadening the universe of comparators when disparate treatment defenses are considered in adverse action appeals; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-215.html#sec13-207">Comparator Employees</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For an example of the analysis applied to find reprisal when the charges against an individual engaged in protected activity are very weak, refer to <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 385 (1993) (applying IRA burdens of proof). <span class="Italic">See Miller v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20161202112">842 F.3d 1252</a> (Fed. Cir. 2016) (overruling the Board, the court determined that the agency failed to rebut through clear and convincing evidence a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation for a protected disclosure). <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 119, 128-130 (1994), involved the termination of a probationer for a series of deficiencies. The Board termination of Lewis was justified because "[w]eighing the strong evidence showing that the agency would have taken the personnel action in any event against the slight motive...to retaliate, we find that the agency has proven by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the appellant during his probationary period absent his disclosure...." The Board concluded that the agency could justifiably scrutinize the appellant's work during probation and that its role "is not to adjudicate the merits of the incidents at issue." <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> can be compared with <span class="Italic">Parikh v. VA</span>, 110 MSPR 295, 2008 MSPB 248 (2008) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Parikh v. VA</span>, 116 MSPR 197, 2011 MSPB 1 (2011)) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Hau v.

<p class="Body-text">In an IRA complaint that a performance appraisal would have been higher had there been no whistleblowing, the Board sided with the agency when it determined that the operative standard required an objective measure of "excellent" performance--two or more unsolicited commendations from the public or officials of other agencies. The appellant had not received the commendations and there was no suggestion that he would have received them without his whistleblowing. Although the Board suggested that it might have waived the requirement of the standard if proof was shown that the standard was not consistently applied, that proof was not provided and the performance rating was not raised. <span class="Italic">Page v. DOJ</span>, 59 MSPR 452 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-text">An interesting case that arose under Title VII provided an explanation of the weight to be given to decisions by agency officials during the course of the selection process. The decision did not consider the clear and convincing test, but it did illuminate the path an agency could follow to dispel a suggestion of pretext relative to nonpromotion or a failure to hire or rehire. <span class="Italic">MacDonald v. Cohen</span>, 233 F.3d 648, 651-52 (1st Cir. 2000), involving the failure to rehire through competitive procedures, determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whatever inference might otherwise be drawn from ten unexplained rejections of a qualified candidate, here the selection of alternate candidates was explained by the government. MacDonald has not pointed to affidavit or other evidence in the record to counter the government's showings as to the colorably superior qualifications of any of the candidates that were selected. Obviously, to say that MacDonald was deemed qualified at the screening stage does not mean that he was more qualified than other candidates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not quite the end of the matter because for one of the ten advertised positions for which MacDonald was deemed qualified by the screener, no candidate was ever selected. The district court's opinion made no separate mention of this no-hire episode, nor is it addressed by the court's main rationale that other candidates were better qualified for the nine positions that were filled. Perhaps on some facts, an inference of discrimination could be drawn from the simple refusal to hire a "qualified" candidate where no other candidate was selected and no explanation was given for failing to hire anyone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But here the government did explain the outcome. It said in discovery that six offers were made to persons who were more highly qualified than MacDonald; only three accepted; and "[a]t that point the selecting officials decided that none of the other applicants had sufficient experience and demonstrated knowledge to successfully perform the job." Specifically, the government said that MacDonald lacked sufficient experience with the office's new procurement procedures and computer systems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing suspicious about a selecting official deciding that although MacDonald was qualified at the screening stage, a close look at his qualifications at the selection stage did not justify his promotion (or that of several other GS-5 applicants who had been referred). What is not explained is why DCMC's rejection letter to MacDonald said that he had been deemed "highly qualified." These words may have been boilerplate or chosen to console (they were not repeated in the next rejection letter) but, in any case, there is no indication that the words comprised any formal ranking or serious evaluation of skills.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;For jobs where ten or more candidates applied, the DCMC did use a formal ranking system for competitive candidates based on points for experience, schooling, etc. DLA Regulation No. 1404.4 Encl. 4 (Jan. 29, 1991). But MacDonald as a handicapped eligible candidate did not need to be ranked, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 213.3101 (2000), and it is unclear that he was ever formally ranked under this system.</p>
