<p class="noindent">Agencies may be requested to reconsider their decisions before the loser takes his case to court, assuming a case and a court to hear it. Although the reconsideration process may be employed by a party before taking a case to court, for an FLRA case, it is not ordinarily a necessary step in the judicial review process, and the availability of judicial review is not a prerequisite to the reconsideration process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468, 479-80 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (following remand, 60 FLRA 446 (2004)) (suggesting that if FLRA injects an issue in its decision not earlier raised, reconsideration should be requested before judicial review is sought). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-18-039.html#sec10-40">Issues Raised Initially in FLRA Decision or Proceedings</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA retains the jurisdiction to reconsider its decisions under 5 CFR 2429.17 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a final decision or order of the Authority has been issued, a party to the proceeding before the Authority who can establish in its moving papers extraordinary circumstances for so doing, may move for reconsideration of such final decision or order. The motion shall be filed within ten (10) days after service of the Authority's decision or order. A motion for reconsideration shall state with particularity the extraordinary circumstances claimed and shall be supported by appropriate citations. The filing and pendency of a motion under this provision shall not operate to stay the effectiveness of the action of the Authority, unless so ordered by the Authority. A motion for reconsideration need not be filed in order to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no provision in FLRA's regulations for filing an opposition to a request for reconsideration of its decision; a request for permission to file an additional pleading will, however, be considered, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Allen Park and AFGE Local 933</span>, 41 FLRA 1429, 1429 (1991), and it is FLRA's practice to grant requests to file oppositions to motions for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 722, 724 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting). As to stays of FLRA decisions, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 722, 724 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), involving review of an arbitrator's award, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.26 of the Authority's Regulations states that the Authority "may in [its] discretion grant leave to file" documents other than those specifically listed in the Regulations.[39] But if a party wants to file a non-listed document (supplemental submission), then the Authority generally requires the party to request leave to file it.[40] Where the Authority declines to consider a supplemental submission, the Authority also declines to consider a response to that submission because the response is moot.[41]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[39]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.26.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Region VI</span>, 67 FLRA 493 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[41]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3562</span>, 68 FLRA 394, 396-97 (2015) (<span class="Italic">Local 3562</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Broad. Bd. of Governors</span>, 66 FLRA 380, 384 (2011)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union requested permission to file its opposition to the Agency's motion for reconsideration. As "it is the Authority's practice to grant requests to file oppositions to motions for reconsideration,"[43] we grant the Union's request.

<p class="noindent-1">An assertion that established law or policy warrants reconsideration states a ground on which the Authority may grant an application for review under &#x00A7; 2422.3 l(c)(2). <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of Agric, Office of the Chief Info.

In this case, the Union contends that "the Authority should reconsider the consolidation decision under [&#x00A7;] 2422.3 l(c)(2)[.]" However, the Union does not identify any established law or policy that should be reconsidered. Instead, the Union contends only that the RD's "consolidation decision" should be reconsidered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consequently, the Union fails to demonstrate that review is warranted under &#x00A7; 2422.3 l(c)(2). <span class="Italic">See CIO,</span> 61 FLRA at 883.</p>

<p class="noindent">The reconsideration process is not an opportunity to relitigate the wisdom of FLRA's underlying decision (including the determination of FLRA not to remand a case for further consideration by an arbitrator), <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Elgin AFB and AFGE Local 1897</span>, 65 FLRA 1047, 1048 (2011):</p>

A party seeking reconsideration under &#x00A7; 2429.17 bears the heavy burden of establishing that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify this unusual action. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Authority has identified a limited number of situations in which extraordinary circumstances have been found to exist. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Atwater, Cal.</span>, 65 FLRA 256, 257 (2010) (<span class="Italic">BOP</span>). These include situations where: (1) an intervening court decision or change in the law affected dispositive issues; (2) evidence, information, or issues crucial to the decision had not been presented to the Authority; (3) the Authority erred in its remedial order, process, conclusion of law, or factual finding; and (4) the moving party has not been given an opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Authority in its decision. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>A party does not establish such extraordinary circumstances by repeating the arguments that the Authority rejected in the underlying dispute. <span class="Italic">See NAIL</span>, 65 FLRA at 667. In this connection, the Authority has repeatedly held that attempts to relitigate conclusions reached by the Authority are insufficient to establish extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">E.g., Sport Air Traffic Controllers Org.</span>, 64 FLRA 1142, 1143 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the Authority erred in its factual findings without citing a factual finding, erroneous or otherwise, that the Authority made. In addition, although the Union claims that the Authority failed to "defer[&#8197;] to the Arbitrator's findings of fact," the Union does not cite a finding of fact to which the Authority did not defer. Accordingly, this argument does not establish a basis for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Union asserts that the Authority erred in its conclusions of law because the Arbitrator's award was consistent with &#x00A7; 551.431. This is the same argument that the Authority rejected in <span class="Italic">Eglin AFB</span>. <span class="Italic">See </span>65 FLRA at 909-10. Thus, this argument does not establish a basis for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See NAIL</span>, 65 FLRA at 667. Additionally, neither <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA at 397, nor <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 39 FLRA at 25-26, holds that the Authority must remand a matter to an arbitrator if he or she applied an incorrect standard of law. Therefore, the Union does not demonstrate that the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">Eglin AFB </span>by not remanding the matter to the Arbitrator in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union asserts that the Authority "raised [an issue] <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>" when it found that the Arbitrator "relied on...Article 36.03 to support her finding of standby." However, as stated in <span class="Italic">Eglin AFB</span>, the Union's grievance alleged that the Agency violated Article 36.03, and the Arbitrator relied on Article 36.03 in rendering her award. <span class="Italic">See </span>65 FLRA at 908-09. Thus, the Authority did not raise Article 36.03 <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. In addition, we note that the Union could have addressed the enforceability of Article 36.03 in its opposition to the Agency's exceptions. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 909. Accordingly, the Union was not deprived of an opportunity to address this issue. <span class="Italic">See BOP</span>, 65 FLRA at 257. Therefore, the Union does not establish a basis for reconsideration. As to the Union's argument in this connection regarding remand, the Union's premise, that the Authority considered Article 36.03 <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, is incorrect. Further, nothing in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 30 FLRA 850, indicates that the Authority should have remanded this matter to the Arbitrator. Accordingly, the Union provides no basis for finding that the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">Eglin AFB </span>by not remanding the matter to the Arbitrator in this regard.</p>
