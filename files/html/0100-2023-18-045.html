<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-46"><span class="space">a.</span> Supporting Evidence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Few Board decisions focus on the sufficiency of the evidence provided with the proposal notice and charges. The evidence supplied should be sufficient to permit a reply. The appellant may attempt to secure additional evidence through requests to the agency, and the Board considers those requests, the materiality of the information requested, and the nature of the agency's response, <span class="Italic">Damewood v. VA</span>, DC-0752-14-1038-I-1 (NP 2/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before taking an appealable action that deprives a tenured Federal employee of his property right in his employment, an agency must provide him with minimum due process of law. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 543-46 (1985). He is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 546; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). Procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee does not receive notice of the employer's evidence against him in support of the charges. <span class="Italic">See Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Thus, we find it necessary to consider whether the deciding official's reliance on the aforementioned list violated the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no requirement that a proposal notice be a self-contained document, and the Board has held that the notice requirement is satisfied when the proposal and any attachments to it, taken together, provide the employee with specific notice of the charges against him so that he can make an informed and meaningful reply. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 15 (2004). Here, there is no dispute that the appellant gave an oral reply and that he received a copy of the list before doing so. Further, the deciding official testified that he asked the appellant about each instance noted in the list during his oral reply, which the deciding official estimated lasted for 2 hours. We therefore find no due process violation because the appellant was aware of what the deciding official would consider and received an opportunity to respond before a decision was made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that he was unable to defend himself against Charge 4 because the list did not provide him with sufficient information to review the cases for which he allegedly failed to follow procedures. Specifically, he states that he only received the veterans' first names and the last four digits of their social security numbers. The administrative judge rejected this argument, finding that the agency provided the appellant with the veterans' first initials, last names, and 4-digit identifying numbers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The list provided to the appellant with the June 2014 proposal notice contained only veterans' initials. There is no dispute that this information alone would not have been sufficient for the appellant to identify the cases cited. However, the appellant had previously received an almost identical copy of the list, which contained veterans' last names and 4-digit identifying numbers. Taking the two lists together, the appellant had veterans' first initials, last names, and 4-digit identifying numbers for items 1 through 14 and 16 on the list. The list also included relevant dates which, presumably, also would have been useful to the appellant in locating these cases. Although the appellant claims that he needed "more information," he neither explains why the aforementioned information was insufficient nor identifies what additional information he would have needed. Thus, as to items 1 through 14 and 16, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency provided the appellant with sufficient information to locate the applicable files and defend himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to item 15, the agency did not identify the veterans whose sensitive files did not include appropriate supporting documentation and only provided the last names of the veterans involved in the appellant's issuance of incorrect HISA approval information. Also, as to the latter, the list referenced an attachment which it appears the agency did not give to the appellant. As to item 17, the agency only provided the veterans' last names. We therefore disagree with the administrative judge that the agency provided the appellant with sufficient information about these two issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found, however, that, even if the agency did not provide the appellant with sufficient information, he could have requested additional information but failed to do so. She did not credit the appellant's claim that he had requested additional information from the proposing and deciding officials and H.D. She noted that: (1) both the proposing official and H.D. denied that the appellant requested additional information from them and would have had no reason not to provide him with the information had he asked for it; and (2) the appellant did not provide any evidence that he requested additional information in writing from the agency. Further, although the deciding official testified that the appellant claimed not to know whether any of the cases identified on the list were actual veteran patients, the administrative judge found that this did not support the appellant's claim that he requested additional information from the deciding official. She found that there was no evidence that the deciding official had any animus against the appellant and that, had the appellant asked for additional information, the deciding official would have investigated the issue, as he did regarding other arguments the appellant raised during the oral reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant again claims that he requested additional information, but he does not provide any evidence or argument to refute the administrative judge's specific credibility findings to the contrary. The Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Accordingly, we will not disturb the administrative <span id="Page_3174"></span>judge's finding that the appellant failed to request additional information regarding Charge 4. Thus, as to items 15 and 17, notwithstanding that the information provided may have been insufficient, we decline to find that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights. <span class="Italic">See McNab v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2014). We also find, based on the foregoing, that the agency's failure to provide sufficient information as to items 15 and 17 did not constitute a harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, based upon the list of deficiencies discussed above, which was corroborated by the proposing official and H.D., that the agency proved Charge 4 by preponderant evidence. We discern no reason to disturb this analysis.[5] The list contains a detailed accounting of the specific tasks that the appellant failed to complete according to required procedures. The proposing official and H.D. provided further explanation of each incident at the hearing. On review, the appellant offers no evidence or argument to refute these incidents. We therefore find that the administrative judge properly sustained Charge 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although the list of deficiencies upon which the agency relied did not provide evidence of some of the alleged instances of the appellant failing to notify vendors and/or veterans of HISA approval, and failing to send HISA packets, the charge can still be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (finding that, where more than one event or factual specification supports a single charge, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge); <span class="Italic">Cole v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 8 (2014) (explaining that an agency is required to prove only the essence of its charge and need not prove each factual specification supporting the charge).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice also described Hairston and his representative's right to review the material on which the removal action was based, including setting the location for review and providing contact information for the contact person, Richard Simonton, a Human Resources Specialist at Walter Reed. Hairston had three phone conversations with Simonton, during which Simonton explained that the evidence could not be sent electronically. Simonton also scheduled an in-person meeting just before Hairston's oral reply, during which Hairston would be able to review the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 27, 2019, the day of Hairston's oral reply, Edward Baker, a union representative, met with Simonton to review the evidence and Hairston's case file. When Hairston arrived, he met with Baker, but Simonton asserts that Hairston did not request to see the evidence. Baker and Hairston then spoke privately for 15 to 20 minutes before being informed that the DDO had arrived. "[U]pon Mr. Hairston's request," the two proceeded to meet with the DDO for the oral reply. Simonton attests that neither Hairston nor Baker asked Simonton to review the evidence again.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">"In general, public employees possess a constitutionally protected property right in their employment and are entitled to due process at each stage of their removal proceedings." <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 975 F.3d 1342, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2020). "Due process requires that the employee be afforded notice 'both of the charges and of the employer's evidence' and an 'opportunity to respond' before being removed from employment." <span class="Italic">Ward v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Public employees are also "entitled to...other procedural protections...afforded them by statute, regulation, or agency procedure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1281. For instance, Office of Personnel Management regulations require an agency to provide the employee with an opportunity to review any materials on which it relied to support its charges. 5 C.F.R. 752.404(b)(1). Errors in the application of these procedures are reversed only if they are harmful. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1281. To prove harmful error, the employee must show that the error is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1281-82; 5 C.F.R. 1201.4(r).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hairston's primary argument on appeal is that his due process rights were violated because he did not have an opportunity to review the evidence on which the agency relied before his termination. Hairston undoubtedly had the <span class="Italic">opportunity</span> to review the evidence against him. The notice of proposed removal provided the location at which Hairston could review the evidence, as well as Simonton's name and contact information. Hairston's phone records indicate that he spoke with Simonton on three occasions about reviewing the evidence. And Simonton submitted a sworn statement that Hairston was scheduled to review all of the evidence at Simonton's office the day of Hairston's oral reply. That Hairston did not actually avail himself of the opportunity to review the evidence against him personally does not imply that he had no opportunity to review the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute, moreover, that Baker reviewed the evidence against Hairston as Hairston's representative. On appeal, Hairston asserts that Baker did not claim to be <span class="Italic">his</span> union representative, but only <span class="Italic">a</span> union representative. Baker's own sworn statement does say that he introduced himself to Hairston as "<span class="Italic">a</span> Union Representative." But we find strong support in the record to support the conclusion that Baker was Hairston's representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Hairston himself referred to Baker as his representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> S.A. 40 (describing Baker as "my Union Representative" in Hairston's appeal to the Board); <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2020 MSPB LEXIS 456, at *13 (asserting that Baker breached "a duty of fair representation"). Second, Hairston's conduct confirms that Baker was his representative. Hairston and Baker met privately prior to Hairston's oral reply, during which, according to Hairston himself, they discussed the agency's evidence. Baker then accompanied Hairston to the meeting with the DDO. And third, others at the oral reply viewed Baker as Hairston's representative. S.A. 29 (DDO summary memorandum of oral reply, stating "Mr. Hairston was represented by Mr. Ed Baker, of the Union"); S.A. 41 (Simonton's sworn statement, that he met Baker "in regards [sic] to Mr. Hairston's verbal reply"); S.A. 42 (sworn statement of Chief, Labor Management Employee Relations, that "Mr. Hairston met with his elected Union representative Mr. Ed Baker"). At no time did Hairston make known to the agency that Baker was not his representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly, it was procedural error for the agency to treat Baker as Hairston's representative without a written designation. <span class="Italic">See</span> S.A. 24 ("Any representative designation should be in writing and submitted to the [DDO].") Indeed, the agency concedes on appeal that this was a procedural error. But Hairston fails to show that the error is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. Had the error been cured by the submission of a writing designating Baker as Hairston's representative, it is unclear how the agency would have reached a different result. Even with a different representative at the prehearing conference before the AJ, Hairston continued to say that he did not contest the charged misconduct. We find the agency's procedural error harmless.</p>

EEOC</span>, SF-0752-16-0689-I-3 (NP 12/7/2022) ("Similarly, the appellant argues on review that the agency never provided him with a copy of the 2011 email policy relevant to the misuse of the agency's email system charge. However, the record shows that the agency provided the appellant with the name of the policy, and then properly cited the relevant portion of the policy in the proposal notice, meaning the appellant had knowledge of what the deciding official was relying on before he submitted his replies to the proposal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Gill v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 308, 311 (1987) (outlining that a proposal notice that sets forth the charges in great factual detail, in conjunction with other evidence, may be considered as part of the agency's valid proof of the charge). Therefore, we find no due process violation.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An incomprehensible evidentiary file that precludes the effective formation of a reply to the charges violates due process. Reversal of an action was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Murphy v. VA</span>, CH-0752-16-0160-I-1 (NP 2/3/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's June 18, 2015 notice of proposed removal includes 16 unnumbered specifications which identify various dates between December 15, 2014, and February 27, 2015, on which it contends that the appellant improperly entered in the ASPEN system certain credit for work he performed. The specifications in the proposal, however, do not indicate to which veteran or case the credits pertained.[2] Instead, the proposal notice informed the appellant that he could review the materials relied upon by the agency in support of its charge. The agency's evidence file is confusing and is not indexed, arranged in chronological order, or tabbed to correspond to the specifications in the proposal notice. It also appears to have been supplemented on at least two occasions after the deciding official notified the appellant that he had reviewed additional information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The specifications also do not clearly explain why the credits entered by the appellant were improper by, for example, citing to agency policies that the agency contends the appellant violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute that he received the documents contained in the agency's evidence file. Thus, the issue is whether such documents provided the appellant sufficient notice to allow him a meaningful opportunity to respond to the charge. The administrative judge found that the documents were so heavily redacted as to deprive the appellant of an opportunity to respond. We agree. As the administrative judge found, the underlying records, which redacted the veterans' names and claim numbers, do not identify the cases for which the appellant allegedly took improper credit. It is also unclear which evidence pertains to which specification. Indeed, the appellant noted in numerous written responses that the redacted documents prevented <span id="Page_3175"></span>him from providing a meaningful response. In particular, he noted that the redacted documents prevented him from reflecting on what actions he took on each veteran's claims because he could not recall the ASPEN action numbers for each case. The appellant also indicated that, because the agency's specifications were unclear, it was possible, if not likely, that he used the wrong documents to respond to the specifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was denied a meaningful opportunity to respond to the agency's charge because the agency's supporting documents denied him the ability to determine whether he had, in fact, performed any work on the pertinent case and/or whether he entered the appropriate credit for the work done on the case....</p>
