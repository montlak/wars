<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-155"><span class="space">7.</span> Allegation of Disability Discrimination; Lack of Reasonable Accommodation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency seeks to remove an employee because of physical disability, the employee may claim the right to reassignment as either an accommodation required under the Rehabilitation Act or an action necessitated by agency regulation or negotiated agreement (an action, if not taken, leading to a harmful error defense). <span class="Italic">Ransom v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 553, 556-57 (1991). It is the employee's burden to plead and prove disability discrimination. If the employee does not establish disability discrimination, the Board considers as a component of its mitigation analysis the agency's ability to have avoided removing the employee by demotion to a job the employee could perform. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 518, 523-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2003). An agency, particularly the Postal Service, may have responsibilities under its collective bargaining agreement to reassign employees to positions they can perform if they become incapable of performing their original positions. The provisions of the contract will be interpreted by the Board. But if a disability discrimination defense is to be raised and if an accommodative responsibility of reassignment or job restructuring is to be established, then the affirmative defense must be raised and proved before the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McPherson v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 624, 633 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 666 F.2d 258 (5th Cir. 1982) (removal of an employee whose physical condition renders him incapable of performing position duties promotes service efficiency), <span class="Italic">Piccone v. United States</span>, 407 F.2d 866 (Ct. Cl. 1969), and <span class="Italic">Mims v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 8, 11 (1987)). If agency regulations require that a job search must be conducted or job restructuring be considered, before an employee with a physical injury is removed, the regulation will be enforced. But the regulation will not be revised by the Board to create additional entitlements for the employee beyond the letter of the regulation. <span class="Italic">Klipstine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 257 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Almazan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 318, 320 (1985)). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-189.html#sec1-187">Involuntary Retirement</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-13-047.html#sec6-48">Failure to Accommodate Disability</a>"; refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-055.html#sec12-53">Rehabilitation Act: Disabling Conditions</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency incorrectly removes an employee for physical inability to perform a job, the agency may find itself in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, that is, the removal may be discriminatory on the basis of disability, as in <span class="Italic">Yates v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 176-79 (1996), involving analysis of medical evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To meet its burden of proving that the appellant was not physically able to perform his duties, the agency must establish a nexus between his medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a <span class="Italic">high probability of hazard</span> when his condition may result in injury to him or others because of the kind of work he does. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dept. of the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 255, 257 (1984) [emphasis in original]. The agency has not met this burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant returned to work in February 1994, following a four-month absence after knee surgery. His physician, Dr. Reszel, asked that he be limited to five hours per day of standing, walking, and twisting, with only one hour of climbing, for a period of three to six months. The agency then sent the appellant for a fitness for duty examination, which was conducted by Dr. Lorber. Dr. Lorber's report described the appellant's medical history, noted that he had arthritis, and concluded that he was not qualified to continue work as a letter carrier. He concluded that the appellant should not stand or walk for more than fifteen minutes at a time, for a total of two hours per eight-hour shift.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In April 1994, the appellant saw a third physician, Dr. Caldwell. Dr. Caldwell thought that if the appellant's discomfort would permit it, there was no reason why he could not attempt working. He added, however, that it was common sense that a more sedentary job would be preferable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the doctors' restrictions, the appellant performed his full duties from the time of his return until his September 1994 removal. Although the appellant may technically have been on light duty for a portion of this time, his duties were not light. He never refused any duties, including overtime, and engaged in extensive standing and walking. There is no evidence that he used leave excessively, was unreliable, or was unable to perform his duties. In short, the agency has not established that the appellant's knee condition led to observed deficiencies in either his performance or his conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the agency established that there is a high probability of hazard if the appellant were to continue working as a letter carrier. In this regard, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's work performance is immaterial. On the contrary, we find it significant that the appellant was able to perform his full duties for five months, with no apparent difficulty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 22 MSPR at 257; <span class="Italic">see also Mantolete v. Bolger,</span> 767 F.2d 1416, 1422 (9th Cir. 1985) (to exclude a qualified disabled individual from employment based on the risk of a possible future injury, there must be a showing of a reasonable possibility of substantial harm, which is determined in light of the individual's work history and medical history, "[s]uch a determination cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the necessary elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination vary according to the particular facts and circumstances at issue, they generally include: a showing that the person is a qualified disabled person and the action appealed was based on his disability; and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Savage v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disabled person is one who "(i) [h]as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (ii) [h]as a record of such an impairment; or (iii) [i]s regarded as having such an impairment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Department of the Navy,</span> 67 MSPR 629 (1995). We have found that the appellant is physically able to perform his position. Further, Dr. Reszel, who was the first doctor to examine the appellant, and the one most familiar with his condition, stated that the physical restrictions placed on the appellant were not permanent, and that he anticipated that the appellant could return to work within three-to-six months. Thus, we find that the appellant does not have an impairment that substantially limits one of his major life activities. Nor is there a record of his having such an impairment. Accordingly, he does not fall within the first two categories of the above definition of a disabled person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that the agency "regarded" him as disabled, the appellant must establish that the agency viewed him as having an impairment(s) that constituted a significant barrier to employment, in that it foreclosed generally the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See Groshans</span>, 67 MSPR at 635-36; <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 387, 394 (1992). Here, the agency removed the appellant based on its erroneous perception that his knee condition substantially limited his ability to perform not only the duties of mail carrier, but other non-sedentary positions. <span class="Italic">See Sargent,</span> 55 MSPR at 395. The agency's testimony establishes that because it viewed the appellant as being limited to performing essentially sedentary duties, it regarded him as being unable to perform a variety of positions, such as window clerk, mail handler, and mail processor. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has shown that the agency regarded him as being disabled, in that it thought that the appellant had an impairment that significantly restricted him from performing a class of jobs. <span class="Italic">See Groshans,</span> 67 MSPR at 638-39.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also shown that he is a qualified disabled person, because he is a disabled person, who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of himself or others. <span class="Italic">See Sargent</span>, 55 MSPR at 395. As we have noted, he was performing his duties adequately before his removal. We note further that accommodation is not an issue in this appeal, as no accommodation was required. <span class="Italic">See Adams v. Reno</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940156 (Feb. 2, 1995), slip op. at 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, he has shown that the agency took the action against him because of his perceived disability. Clearly, the agency removed him because it regarded him as unable to perform his, and a variety of other, positions. Accordingly, the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not provided any reason for its action other than its erroneous perception that the appellant was disabled. Therefore, it has not met its burden of setting forth a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">See Savage,</span> 36 MSPR at 153. In the absence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the agency's action, we find that the agency's action was based on discrimination, in that it removed the appellant because of his perceived disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 15, 24-26 (1997), concluded that an agency discriminated against an individual based on a disability that should not have resulted in the employee's removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination generally include: a showing that the appellant is a qualified disabled person and the action appealed was based on his disability; and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes that he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 178; <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disabled person is one who "(i) [h]as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (ii) [h]as a record of such an impairment; or (iii) [i]s regarded as having such an impairment." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 178.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, there is a lack of evidence that the appellant's sleep apnea precludes him from performing the duties of his position. Further, <span id="Page_2217"></span>the parties agree, and the medical evidence supports, that this medical condition, while permanent, is treatable. Moreover, the agency has not identified any specific incidents when the appellant was observed sleeping on duty and has not even alleged that the appellant was ever observed sleeping on duty during the 9 months preceding his removal. We therefore find that the appellant does not have an impairment that substantially limits one of his major life activities<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 178 (the employee did not have an impairment that substantially limits one of his major life activities where he was physically able to perform the duties of his position, and his doctor stated that the medical restrictions were not permanent and he would be able to return to work in 3 to 6 months). Nor do we find sufficient evidence to constitute a record of his having such an impairment<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1)(ii), (4). Thus, the appellant does not fall within the first two categories of the above definition of a disabled person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To fall within the third category of disabled persons, the appellant must show that the agency viewed him as having an impairment that constituted a significant barrier to employment, in that it foreclosed generally the type of employment involved<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 178-79. Here, although there was insufficient evidence that the appellant's sleep apnea condition ever affected his work performance, and the agency was unable to identify any specific incidents when he was observed sleeping on duty, the agency nevertheless viewed the appellant's sleep apnea, at the time of the removal action, as causing him to sleep while on duty, a condition that the agency perceived created an undue hardship and could not be accommodated in his Supply Clerk position or in any position for which he was otherwise qualified. In other words, the agency, at the time of the removal action, viewed the appellant's sleep apnea condition as substantially limiting his ability to work in any position based on its erroneous perception that this condition was causing him to sleep while on duty. We therefore find that the appellant has shown that the agency regarded him as being disabled in that it thought that he had an impairment that foreclosed generally the type of employment involved<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1)(iii), (5); <span class="Italic">Yates</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 178-79 (the agency regarded the employee as disabled where it viewed him as being unable to perform a class of positions based on its erroneous perception that his knee condition limited him to performing only sedentary duties).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant was performing the duties of his position satisfactorily up until his removal without any accommodation. Thus, the appellant has shown that he is a qualified disabled person because he is a person with a perceived disability, who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of himself or others<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 179; <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 387, 395 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the causation requirement for a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination has been established because the agency admittedly removed the appellant because it regarded him as physically unable to perform his position and it perceived that his medical condition could not be accommodated. The appellant therefore has shown that the agency removed him because of his perceived disability<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 179.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not provided any reason for its removal action other than its erroneous perception that the appellant was disabled. Therefore, it has not met its burden of setting forth a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 179; <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. In the absence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the agency's action, we find that the appellant's removal was based on discrimination because of his perceived disability<span class="Italic">.
