<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-163"><span class="space">B.</span> ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2018, administrative law judges were appointed through a specialized selection process, summarized in <span class="Italic">Meeker v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3239):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ALJs are selected following an examination. In order to be able to take the examination, an applicant must be rated "eligible" by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"). After the receipt of an "eligible" rating, an applicant takes the examination, which is administered by OPM. An applicant who obtains a passing score on the examination is placed on OPM's ALJ register. When a government agency has an ALJ vacancy, it requests a list of eligibles from the register. OPM provides the agency with a list of eligible and available applicants based on their final scores on the ALJ examination. The agency then selects from this list of eligibles to fill its ALJ position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By Executive Order 13843 of July 10, 2018, President Trump excepted ALJs from the competitive service and allowed agencies directly to appoint ALJs, in the same manner that they could appoint excepted service attorneys. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/13/2018-15202/excepting-administrative-law-judges-from-the-competitive-service">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/13/2018-15202/excepting-administrative-law-judges-from-the-competitive-service</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The removal or suspension of an ALJ is also through a specialized procedure. In the usual adverse action appeal, the employee suffers the action and then appeals. With administrative law judges, the employing agency must file a complaint with MSPB before the ALJ can be disciplined. The Board hears and decides the complaint before the disciplinary action, if approved by the Board, is taken. Evidence is taken by an ALJ who writes an initial decision that is reviewable by the full Board through a petition for review. If no PFR is filed within the regulatory period, the initial decision becomes the final decision of the Board. If a timely PFR is filed, the initial decision does not become final; a final decision is then issued by the Board unless the case is remanded for further consideration by the ALJ who heard the complaint against the responding ALJ. When the decision authorizing the agency to remove or suspend the ALJ is final, then the agency presumably suspends or removes the judge from the federal service. Until that time, during the pendency of the complaint before the Board and until the final Board decision authorizing <span id="Page_2232"></span>removal, the ALJ remains in pay and duty status (although the agency could detail the ALJ to duties other than hearing and deciding cases). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec15-1">Chapter 5</a> for the petition for review process.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Actions against administrative law judges are permitted by 5 USC 7521(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An action may be taken against an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of this title by the agency in which the administrative law judge is employed only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulations governing actions against ALJs are at 5 CFR 1201.137-.142 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.137 <span class="Italic">Covered actions; filing complaint; serving documents on parties.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Covered actions</span>. The jurisdiction of the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7521 and this subpart with respect to actions against administrative law judges is limited to proposals by an agency to take any of the following actions against an administrative law judge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Suspension;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Reduction in pay; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Furlough of 30 days or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Place of filing</span>. To initiate an action against an administrative law judge under this subpart, an agency must file a complaint with the Clerk of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial filing and service</span>. The agency must file a copy of the complaint, together with numbered and tabbed exhibits or attachments, if any, and a certificate of service listing each party or the party's representative. The certificate of service must show the last known address, telephone number, and facsimile number of each party or representative. The agency must serve a copy of the complaint on each party and the party's representative, as shown on the certificate of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Subsequent filings and service</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responsibilities of Clerk of the Board</span>. The Clerk of the Board shall furnish a copy of the applicable Board regulations to each administrative law judge named as a respondent in the complaint and shall inform each respondent of his or her rights under paragraph (b) of this section and the requirements regarding the timeliness and content of an answer to the agency's complaint under paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively, of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rights</span>. When an agency files a complaint proposing an action against an administrative law judge under 5 U.S.C. 7521 and this subpart, the administrative law judge has the right:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Filing and default</span>. A respondent named in an agency complaint may file an answer with the Clerk of the Board within 35 days of the date of service of the complaint. If a respondent fails to answer, the failure may constitute waiver of the right to contest the allegations in the complaint. Unanswered allegations may be considered admitted and may form the basis of the administrative law judge's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Content</span>. An answer must contain a specific denial, admission, or explanation of each fact alleged in the complaint. If the respondent has no knowledge of a fact, he or she must say so. The respondent may include statements of fact and appropriate documentation to support each denial or defense.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule regarding Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) is that affirmative defenses are waived if not pleaded in the answer. <span class="Italic">Hauschild v. United States</span>, 53 Fed. Cl. 134, 139 (2002)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Jennings</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at &#x00B6; 25, an affirmative defense that could have been raised in an earlier case is precluded by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> from being litigated in a later case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). Thus, <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action, and is applicable if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> purposes, a cause of action is the set of facts that gives an appellant the right to seek relief from an agency. <span class="Italic">Frias v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 276, 280, <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 43 F.3d 1486 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). We agree with the administrative law judge that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies here because a claim of a USERRA violation could have been properly raised in <span class="Italic">Jennings I</span> in connection with the appellant's removal, the judgment in that case was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction, the prior judgment was a judgment on the merits, and the same set of facts giving rise to the right to seek relief and the same parties were involved in both cases. In this regard, we agree with the administrative law judge that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not require that the prior decision expressly address a particular claim in its judgment on the merits, even if that claim had been properly raised. <span class="Italic">See Hornback v. United States</span>, 85 Fed. Appx. 758, 762 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds as recognized by Young v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board emphasized that in an action against an ALJ, or in a constructive removal appeal by an ALJ, the Board appeal is to be assigned to an adjudicated by an administrative law judge, not by an MSPB AJ, <span class="Italic">McDougall v. SSA</span>, 114 MSPR 534, 536-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2010 MSPB 163 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has original jurisdiction to adjudicate adverse actions against administrative law judges under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 12 (2010); <span class="Italic">see Tunik v. Merit <span id="Page_2233"></span>Systems Protection Board</span>, 407 F.3d 1326, 1332-33 (Fed. Cir. 2005). An agency may take an action against an administrative law judge "only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a); <span class="Italic">see Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the procedures in an action against an administrative law judge differ from those in adverse action appeals by other federal employees because an administrative law judge is entitled to have his appeal adjudicated <span id="Page_2234"></span>under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Dantoni</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 516, 521, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 173 F.3d 435 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 120, 124 (1985). The provisions for adverse action appeals under Chapter 75, Subchapter II, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7514, do not apply to adverse actions taken against administrative law judges, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the APA, the taking of evidence and any hearing in an action against an administrative law judge must be presided over by the full Board, one or more Board members, or an administrative law judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 556(b). The Board's regulations specifically designate that "[a]n administrative law judge will hear an action brought by an employing agency under this subpart against a respondent administrative law judge." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.140(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Dantoni</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 521. The assigned administrative law judge prepares the initial decision, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 557, that ultimately can be reviewed by the Board via a petition for review. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.140(a)(2). This same procedure applies when an administrative law judge brings an action affirmatively alleging constructive removal by the agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's appeal was adjudicated by the administrative judge as an adverse action appeal under Chapter 75, Subchapter II. This was error because those provisions do not apply to adverse actions taken against administrative law judges, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(E), and the administrative judge lacked authority to adjudicate the administrative law judge's appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 556(b). Furthermore, given the special procedural rules which apply to actions against administrative law judges, a complaint should have been filed with the Clerk of the Board, rather than with a regional office, for special handling. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.137(b), 1201.142.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, it was error to assign the appellant's case to an administrative judge, and the appeal must be adjudicated anew by an administrative law judge under the APA. After the administrative law judge prepares an initial decision, the appellant can seek further review before the full Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.140(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that its regulatory scheme is consistent with statutory and constitutional due process requirements, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57, 63-64 (1984) (the regulations cited in <span class="Italic">Glover</span> have changed over time) :</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent was entitled to a determination of whether good cause existed to discipline him "on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521. This statutory provision entitled him to an adjudication under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in accordance with the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 556<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 554. He was therefore entitled to a "fair trial conducted in accordance with fundamental principles of fair play and applicable procedural standards established by law." <span class="Italic">Swift &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Co. v. United States,</span> 308 F.2d 849, 851 (7th Cir. 1962).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the APA respondent was entitled to present his case or defense by relevant and material oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as might be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts in a hearing conducted under published agency rules setting forth the powers and duties of the presiding official. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 556(c) and (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's published rules applicable to a complaint against an administrative law judge provide for a hearing before one of the Board's administrative law judges and for issuance by him of a recommended decision only. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.132. The Board reserves to itself the final decision on good cause and the appropriate penalty if it finds good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations also provide that, except as otherwise expressly provided in the sections relating to hearings on complaints against administrative law judges (sections 1201.131-1201.136 the hearing is to be governed by the procedures set forth in 5 CFR Part 1201 Subpart B comprising regulations 1201.11-1201.118. The Board has set forth at section 1201.41 the powers and duties of the presiding administrative law judge in his conduct of the hearing. Included in his authority is the power to issue subpoenas in accordance with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.81; receive relevant evidence; rule on the institution of discovery as provided in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.73; regulate the course of the hearing; rule on all motions, witness and exhibit lists; and order the production of evidence and the appearance of witnesses whose testimony would be relevant and material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For respondent to support his allegation that he was denied a full and fair hearing, he must show that Judge Reidy's conduct of the hearing was such as to deny him the hearing required by the APA with the result that he suffered substantial prejudice. <span class="Italic">Ka Fung</span> <span class="Italic">Chan v. INS,</span> 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Lober,</span> 630 F.2d 335, 337-338 (5th Cir. 1980)<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent argues that the Board's presiding administrative law judge denied him a fair and impartial hearing by "acting in concert" with the agency to prevent justice. Respondent purports to support this allegation by a lengthy recitation of perceived wrongs inflicted upon him. Our examination of the record reveals respondent's litany of alleged wrongs to be baseless.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a complaint brought against an ALJ, the Board decides if there is good cause for discipline and then authorizes the appropriate discipline that the agency may impose. It is up to the agency then to determine whether, when, and under what conditions, that discipline will be imposed or served. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS v. Haley</span>, 20 MSPR 365, 367 (1984) (suspension for the unofficial use of a GOV).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For personnel actions involving an ALJ not encompassed by the MSPB complaint process for removals or suspensions (or constructive removals or suspensions), the ALJ may also have recourse under the grievance procedure of a union contract for his bargaining unit or through the EEO process. The Whistleblower Protection Act provides an avenue of appeal to MSPB as long as the ALJ first seeks recourse through the Special Counsel by an IRA complaint. [The IRA whistleblower process is described in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-125.html#sec13-121">Pleading to OSC.</a>"] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lawson v. DHHS</span>, 64 MSPR 673, 683 (1994) (assuming covered personnel actions embraced travel policy, credit hours, scheduling of hearings, and case rotation, the ALJ had not exhausted OSC remedies); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rutberg v. OSHRC</span>, 78 MSPR 130, 148-49 (1998) (proper mode of analysis for a challenge to the RIF of an ALJ was a WPA affirmative defense rather than a theory that the RIF was designed to undermine ALJ's decisional independence); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. SSA</span>, 72 MSPR 116, 122 (1996) (ALJ had not first exhausted his IRA administrative remedies). Of whistleblowing reprisal allegations by an ALJ respondent, <span class="Italic">SSA v. White</span>, CB-7521-11-0004-T-1 (NP 4/22/2013), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent argued below that the charges against her were brought in retaliation for protected whistleblowing activity. Our reviewing court has implicitly held that a claim of whistleblowing reprisal brought by an ALJ in a section 7521 case is to be analyzed under Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) standards. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1999). That is, the employee must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she made a protected disclosure, and that the disclosure was a contributing factor to the action taken against her, and, if she makes the required showings, the burden then falls on the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ALJ did not conduct such an analysis, however, but instead applied the same standards applicable to claims of retaliation for protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). That is, he inquired whether the respondent had shown that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of that activity; (3) the employment action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the employment action. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We will therefore now analyze the respondent's whistleblowing claims under the appropriate section 2302(b)(8) standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The threshold inquiry is whether the respondent made a disclosure protected under the WPA. A protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is any disclosure of information by an employee which the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; a gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). The proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that her disclosure revealed misconduct described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence wrongdoing as defined by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent's initial disclosures took place at an April 9, 2009 judge's meeting attended by, among others, the respondent, Parks Saunders, Voisin, and ALJ Henry Chambers. First, the respondent asserted that the Virtual Hearing Reporters (VHRs) engaged by the agency were not being properly paid. Specifically, she alleged that the VHRs were agency employees and that Parks Saunders had illegally cut their pay so as to misrepresent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the VHRs were independent contractors. Second, the respondent stated at the meeting that cases were being moved at the agency's expense from New Orleans to the Houma, Louisiana office for the convenience of Voisin and that <span id="Page_2235"></span>she could obtain statistics supporting her assertion from Senator Vitter's office. According to the respondent, Parks Saunders responded to both disclosures by threatening to fire her. Following the April 9, 2009 meeting, the respondent filed a disclosure with the Disclosures Unit of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), concerning the IRS issue, and also filed a whistleblower complaint with OSC's Complaints Examining Unit, concerning the alleged threat to fire.[6] In addition, the respondent reported the alleged misclassification of VHRs to the IRS Whistleblower Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The latter complaint constitutes protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A). However, we discern no error in the ALJ's finding that the respondent failed to establish a claim of retaliation for (b)(9) activity, and the respondent does not contest that finding on petition for review. The respondent also argued below that charges were brought against her in retaliation for filing a defamation lawsuit against Hunter, but the ALJ correctly found that the filing of a defamation lawsuit is not protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or (9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent appears to contend that she disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation with respect to the VHRs. However, her purported explanation of why VHRs should not be classified as independent contractors is devoid of legal citations and fails to establish reasonable grounds for concluding that the VHRs should instead be classified as agency employees. For the same reason, the respondent failed to establish that she reasonably believed Parks Saunders illegally cut VHR pay in order to misrepresent to the IRS that the VHRs were independent contractors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the relocation of cases from New Orleans to the Houma office, debatable differences concerning policy matters are not protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2004). For a lawful agency policy to constitute "gross mismanagement," an employee must disclose such serious errors by the agency that a conclusion the agency erred is not debatable among reasonable people.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Similarly, a "gross waste of funds" constitutes a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government. <span class="Italic">Van Ee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 693, 698 (1994). The respondent has not shown a reasonable basis for believing that the assignment of cases to the Houma office constituted anything more than a debatable policy decision or expenditure. Moreover, insofar as the respondent may claim to have disclosed an abuse of authority, her allegation that cases were being assigned to the Houma office for the personal convenience of Voisin is purely speculative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find the respondent failed to establish that she had a reasonable belief that her disclosures at the April 9, 2009 meeting or her disclosures to OSC and the IRS evidenced a type of wrongdoing listed at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Her whistleblowing reprisal defense therefore fails.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may look to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance concerning aspects of ALJ complaint cases, as it did in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Abell</span>, 47 MSPR 98, 100-01 (1991), allowing an agency voluntarily to dismiss a furlough-based complaint against ALJs under FRCP 41(a)(2) unless there is clear legal prejudice to the respondent. In <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, the possibility of a favorable initial decision was insufficient for the Board to retain jurisdiction. The possibility of a counsel fee award was also insufficient to retain jurisdiction, although the respondent was free to file a motion for fees pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.37. Chairman Levinson filed a concurring opinion stating that when an agency seeks to dismiss a complaint, the Board has no discretion but to dismiss the complaint; the discretion the Board granted itself under Rule 41 was, Mr. Levinson thought, excessive. <span class="Italic">In re Sannier</span>, 45 MSPR 420, 424-25 (1990), noted again the Board's interest in taking procedural guidance from the Federal Rules in ALJ cases. In <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, the Board followed Federal Rule 15, calling for written consent or leave of the Board for a party to file an amended complaint. The Board also determined that, in accordance with Board rules, once the record before the ALJ closes, additional evidence and argument will not be accepted unless the party submitting it shows that the evidence was not readily available before the record closed. <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 MSPR 684, 690 (1993), stated that as to a complaint against an ALJ, an administrative pleading is to be liberally construed. The Board rejected the argument that each paragraph of the complaint should be read in isolation. <span class="Italic">Whittlesey</span> added that an agency does not admit the respondent's affirmative defenses by failing to answer them. But <span class="Italic">DHHS v. Underwood</span>, 68 MSPR 24, 25 (1995), involving a complaint seeking the removal of an ALJ on extended absence from duty in LWOP status due to a compensable injury, confirmed that "failure to answer a complaint without a showing of good cause will result in a default decision and the allegations in the complaint will serve as the basis for the Board's decision." <span class="Italic">SSA v. Hyatt</span>, CB-7521-13-0186-T-1 (NP 3/24/2014), defaulted an ALJ who failed timely to respond to a complaint seeking his two-day suspension: "The respondent does not otherwise allege that he did not understand the underlying charge such that he was prevented from filing a meaningful response to the complaint."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Long</span>, 113 MSPR 190, 195-96 &#x00B6; 10-11, 2010 MSPB 19 (2010), denied an attempt to amend a complaint against an ALJ after the hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the ALJ did not err in denying the petitioner's motion to amend its complaint after the hearing to add a specification of false testimony in support of its charge against the respondent. The petitioner argued that the Board should amend the complaint to conform to the evidence, consistent with practice under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b). The Board, however, is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but looks to them for guidance. <span class="Italic">Triplett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 575, &#x00B6; 9 n.1 (citing <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 44, 47 (1997)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 322 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, even under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b), amendment is not proper where the issue to be added was not tried by the express or implied consent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Narcisse</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 222, 226-27 (1991) <span class="Italic">vacated in part on other grounds on reconsideration</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 294 (1994); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nichols</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 445, 457 (1988). There was no express consent here. Further, the test for implied consent is whether the respondent failed to object to the introduction of evidence, or introduced evidence himself, that was relevant only to the new issue. <span class="Italic">Narcisse</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 227; <span class="Italic">Nichols</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 457. There was no implied consent here because the respondent's hearing testimony in this appeal was relevant to both the charge of conduct unbecoming an ALJ and the proposed amendment. <span class="Italic">Narcisse</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 227; <span class="Italic">Nichols</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 457. Therefore, the ALJ correctly denied the petitioner's motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The hearing in a complaint against an ALJ is at the option of either party, in contrast to the sole right of the appellant to elect a hearing in the usual adverse action appeal, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Dantoni</span>, 77 MSPR 516, 520-22 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dantoni v. SSA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3188):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner brought the instant case against the respondent before the Board pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521. This statute provides that a removal action may be taken against an ALJ only for good cause established and determined by the Board on the record "after opportunity for hearing" before the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations governing actions against ALJs state that, when an agency proposes an action against an ALJ, our procedures under subpart B of our regulations apply to the hearing, unless provided otherwise. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.131<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.11. Subpart B contains the Board's procedures for appellate cases. It governs a broad spectrum of procedural issues including, among other things, the filing of appeals and responses, time computation, parties, representatives, witnesses, attorney fees, powers of administrative judges, hearings, records, motions, burdens of proof, evidence, discovery, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, and initial decisions. It provides that, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, an appellant has a right to a hearing, that the appellant must make a timely request for a hearing, and that, if the appellant does not make a timely request for a hearing, the right to a hearing is waived. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.24(d) and (e). Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that an administrative judge may issue a decision based on the record alone where an appellant fails to appear at a hearing without good cause, noting that the hearing requirement in &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) is for the employee's benefit<span class="Italic">. See Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Thus, there is some support by analogy for the respondent's position that he alone had the right to request a hearing, and that the hearing must be deemed waived in the absence of his timely request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree, however, with the CALJ's conclusion that the petitioner is entitled to a hearing over the respondent's objection here because the present case is not governed by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701. That statute states that an employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Board from any action that is appealable to the Board under any law, rule or regulation, and that an "appellant" shall have the right to a hearing. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a). The petitioner here is a Federal agency that is seeking authority from the Board to remove an administrative law judge under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521. The respondent has not submitted an appeal over this matter. Thus, there is no employee or applicant for employment filing an appeal, and there is, therefore, no "appellant" with a right to a hearing before us in this matter. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, &#x00A7; 7521 controls this proceeding, and requires the Board to determine whether good cause exists on the record "after an opportunity for hearing," whether the petitioner may remove the respondent. Section 7521 does not limit the hearing opportunity to a particular party, as does &#x00A7; 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has held that &#x00A7; 7521 requires a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and, contrary to the respondent's arguments, the Board's regulations governing actions against administrative law judges reflect this APA requirement by limiting Subpart B's application in the matter before us. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.131<span class="Italic">. See In re Doyle,</span> 29 MSPR 170, 173 (1985). The regulations provide that an employing agency's action against an ALJ will be heard by an ALJ, who will issue a recommended decision in accordance with 5 USC &#x00A7; 557. 5 CFR &#x00A7; <span id="Page_2236"></span>1201.135(a). 5 USC &#x00A7; 557 is part of the APA, and controls the recommended decisions that are issued following a hearing required under 5 USC &#x00A7; 556. That provision describes the manner in which hearings required under 5 USC &#x00A7; 554 must be conducted. Section 554 provides that in all cases of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, the agency, i.e., the Board here, "shall give all interested parties opportunity for...hearing and decision" in accordance with sections 556 and 557. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 554(a) and (c). Thus, our regulations require our CALJ to issue a recommended decision under 5 USC &#x00A7; 557, instead of an initial decision under Subpart B, and &#x00A7; 557, in turn, requires application of &#x00A7; 554, which allows all interested parties, such as the petitioner here, the opportunity for a hearing. <span class="Italic">See National Labor Relations Board v. Boyce,</span> 51 MSPR 295, 300 (1991). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 559 (APA's requirements or privileges relating to evidence or procedure apply equally to agencies and persons). Because the hearing at issue here was held pursuant to &#x00A7; 554, Board and court cases construing an appellant's right to hearing under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701 do not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the respondent's assertion that our decision in <span class="Italic">In re Spielman</span>, 1 MSPB 50, 1 MSPR 53 (1979), requires a hearing on the basis of the written record where a respondent ALJ waives his right to a hearing. In <span class="Italic">Spielman</span>, the petitioner sought to suspend the respondent ALJ for falsifying documents. The respondent neither admitted nor denied the petitioner's allegations of misconduct, waived the hearing, and requested a decision based on the written record. The Board stated that the respondent's failure to contest the charges allowed it to adjudicate the case without a hearing, based upon the regulations in effect at that time. 1 MSPR at 57-58. <span class="Italic">Spielman</span>, however, does not specifically limit the right to a hearing, and is distinguishable from the instant case in several respects. There is no indication there that the petitioner sought a hearing, as the petitioner has here; the Board's statements regarding the respondent's waiver were based upon regulations no longer in effect; and that decision was silent regarding the statutory basis for its conclusion on the hearing issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">All the ALJ agency-initiated disciplinary complaint cases in the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> follow the pattern of a complaint, a hearing process, and ultimately a decision by the Board as to whether to authorize the agency to take the action it requested, something less, or nothing. There is a variation on the theme for Members of the Board of Veterans Appeals who serve as Veterans Law Judges in VA benefits claims appeals. For disciplinary purposes, those judges are treated as ALJs, but the process differs. Before the VA files a Board complaint against a VA law judge, the VA must first give the VLJ a notice of the proposal to file an MSPB complaint, an opportunity to respond, and then a decision on the proposal, likely leading to an MSPB complaint against the VLJ. 38 USC 7101A provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1)&#x2003;A member of the Board (other than the Chairman or a member of the Senior Executive Service) may be removed as a member of the Board by reason of job performance only as provided in subsections (c) and (d). Such a member may be removed by the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the Chairman, for any other reason as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;In the case of a removal of a member under this section for a reason other than job performance that would be covered by section 7521 of title 5 in the case of an administrative law judge, the removal of the member of the Board shall be carried out subject to the same requirements as apply to removal of an administrative law judge under that section. Section 554(a)(2) of title 5 shall not apply to a removal action under this subsection. In such a removal action, a member shall have the rights set out in section 7513(b) of that title.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 554(a)(2) exempts from the APA "the selection or tenure of an employee, except a[n] administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of this title."</p>
