<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-177"><span class="space">i.</span> Sovereign Immunity</h5>
<p class="noindent">A concise summary of sovereign immunity is provided by <span class="Italic">DHHS, FDA and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-056.html">60 FLRA 250</a>, 252 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States is immune from liability under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187 (1996). Sovereign immunity can be waived by statute, but a waiver will be found only if "unequivocally expressed in statutory text...and will not be implied[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 192. Thus, a Federal agency will be subject to a monetary claim only if the statute on which the claim is based unambiguously establishes that the Government has waived its sovereign immunity to permit suit, and that the scope of that waiver extends to an award of money damages.<span class="Italic"> Id. See also INS, Los Angeles Dist., Los Angeles, Cal., </span>52 FLRA 103 (1996). As such, an award by an arbitrator that an agency provide monetary damages to a union must be supported by statutory authority to impose such a remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">"In cases where a party's sovereign-immunity claim depends on an argument that an arbitration award is contrary to the Act, and the Authority finds that the award is consistent with the Act, the Authority denies the sovereign-immunity claim." <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 67 FLRA 461, 464 (2014) (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Milan and AFGE Local 1741</span>, 63 FLRA 188, 189-90 (2009).); <span class="Italic">cf. SSA ODAR and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 65 FLRA 334, 337 (2010) (claim of sovereign immunity may be raised at any time).</p>
<p class="noindent">The defense of sovereign immunity may be raised at any time, meaning it need not first be raised with the arbitration, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-030.html">61 FLRA 146</a>, 151 (2005) (enforced<span class="Italic">, Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 521 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent "does not dispute that it has not implemented the award's requirement that the Agency pay overtime to certain employees for time spent commuting." However, the Respondent argues that the "doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes ordering a [G]overnment agency to provide monetary relief absent a showing that the [G]overnment has unambiguously consented to that particular remedy." The Respondent contends that expending funds to pay the subject employees for commute time is precluded by Government-wide regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.422. The Respondent thus seeks to collaterally attack the award by raising a sovereign immunity defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a party's exception disputes an award's consistency with a law, we review the question of law raised by the award and the exception <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making such a determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Additionally, as a general rule, an agency cannot collaterally attack an arbitration award during the processing of a ULP complaint alleging an unlawful failure to comply with that award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 15 FLRA 151, 153-54 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom., Department of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 727, 734-35 (6th Cir. 1985).<span class="Italic"> </span>However, a claim of federal sovereign immunity can be raised by an agency at any time. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Army v.

<p class="noindent-1">...IRS argues that the FLRA misconstrued the law of sovereign immunity by basing the waiver on language within the CBA, as opposed to the statutory text. As previously noted, only if the statutory text is explicit can the United States' sovereign immunity be deemed waived. <span class="Italic">See Lane</span>, 518 U.S. at 192. The mere fact that the IRS and the NTEU came to an agreement in the CBA regarding the compensation of affected employees is plainly insufficient to show a waiver of sovereign immunity. However, in this case, the FLRA did not rely on the CBA in determining that there was a waiver of sovereign immunity. Initially, the arbitrator found that the IRS violated the FLSA, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act. The FLRA was clear that it relied on the Portal-to-Portal Act in determining that sovereign immunity had been waived. Indeed, it specifically stated that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(b) was "a statute that in the circumstances presented waived the Government's sovereign immunity." Therefore, the requisite statutory waiver was present, as opposed to an insufficient contractual waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent">The defense to an arbitration award that an expenditure required by the award is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity appears in passing in several cases discussed in this chapter. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-206.html#sec9-204">Priority Consideration</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-17-232.html#sec9-230">Overtime Compensation</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-17-263.html#sec9-261">Other Compensation and Leave Cases</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-17-264.html#sec9-262">Damages, Penalties, Expenses, Interest</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-17-274.html#sec9-271">Statutory Pay Systems; Statutory Pay Premiums; Bonuses</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-17-015.html#sec9-16">Environmental Differential Pay</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-17-400.html#sec9-398">Awards of Counsel Fees</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">When FLRA considers the defense that an award directing the expenditure of funds is invalid without specific statutory authorization for the expenditure, FLRA considers the nature of the expenditure authorized and, if that expenditure required statutory authorization, the availability of that authorization. A typical analysis is presented in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA 293, 298-99 (1999), an atypical case. The <span class="Italic">NATCA</span> litigation arose in the context of a ULP complaint filed when the agency failed to abide by an award directing the acquisition of additional parking space for use by employees. Although FLRA stated that it would not consider in ULP enforcement proceedings defenses to the merits of an unexcepted award, FLRA considered and rejected the defense in the ULP proceeding that the acquisition of the parking space would require expenditures barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's claims that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the imposition of a remedy for money damages and that there is no statutory authority to require reimbursement for parking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1975"></span>As noted in <span class="Italic">INS, </span>52 FLRA 103, the United States is immune from liability for money damages under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena, </span>518 U.S. 187 (1996). The Respondent argues that the Judge's remedy involves money damages. However, the remedy in this case does not involve money damages. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, United States Army Commissary, Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, et al. v. FLRA, </span>56 F.3d 273 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">vacating in part</span> 48 FLRA 6 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Department of the Army v. FLRA</span>), the court discussed the difference between money damages and equitable relief. In that case, the Authority directed an agency to reimburse employees for all monies lost or interest charged as a result of a failure to bargain over the agency's change in pay lag policy. The court vacated the Authority's money judgment on grounds that such a remedy was compensation for consequential losses and was therefore money damages barred by the Government's sovereign immunity. 56 F.3d at 276. The court characterized "money damages" as a payment to a plaintiff of a sum of money for "something lost <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">consequence </span>of the defendant's act," and as a <span class="Italic">substitute</span> for a suffered loss in an action at law for damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 276 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). On the other hand, the remedy in an equitable action "'attempt[s] to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Massachusetts, </span>487 U.S. 879, 895 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Bowen</span>) and citing <span class="Italic">Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Department of Health and</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services, </span>763 F.2d 1441, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). The court recognized that a monetary award can be either legal or equitable in nature. <span class="Italic">See also Bowen,</span> 487 U.S. at 893 ("The fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as 'money damages.'").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relief ordered by the Judge directed the Respondent to obtain parking spaces for unit employees in a different location than had been made available by the Respondent.&#x2003;Insofar as the remedy directed the Respondent to provide parking at no cost to employees, the specific remedy may be characterized as equitable in nature. Consequently, the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Department of the Army v. FLRA, </span>to support its contention that a remedy of money damages cannot be sustained in this case, is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, since the Respondent was not directed to reimburse employees for any expenses, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">INS, </span>52 FLRA 103. In that case, the respondent was found to have violated the Statute by discontinuing its practice of providing free parking on its property without fulfilling its bargaining obligations. As a consequence of the respondent's action, employees incurred expenses charged by parking garages and lots, and the General Counsel requested the imposition of a make-whole remedy. The Authority found that, in the absence of any statutory authority permitting such a remedy, the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the requested relief. The Authority instead ordered the respondent to restore the practice of providing parking on the respondent's property.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent argues that the Authority cannot impose "a monetary claim" for parking without statutory authority, there is no contention that the Respondent is not authorized to procure parking for its employees, even if it involves an expenditure of money. Indeed, no one questioned the Respondent's authority to enter into the leasing arrangement that required it to procure employee parking at DIA. The General Counsel states that the Respondent's own regulation, FAA Order 4665.3B, authorizes the expenditure of funds to pay for parking. Specifically, that regulation states, in pertinent part, that "nothing in this order shall preclude the expenditure of funds to provide reasonable parking accommodations at FAA facilities."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, Federal statute provides the Respondent with general procurement authority to acquire leased property. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40110 sets forth the general procurement authority of the FAA Administrator...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Federal Property Management Regulations.&#x2003;promulgated by GSA, "[a]cquisitions of leased space by agencies possessing independent statutory authority to acquire such space are not subject to GSA approval or authority." 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-18.102. Additionally, "all agencies" are authorized to acquire certain types of space, including "garage space" which "may be leased only on a fiscal year basis[.]" 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-18.104-2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, GSA has authorized agencies to procure garage space. That, coupled with FAA's authority to obligate funds for interests in property leads us to find that the Respondent has the authority to expend money to comply with the Judge's remedy.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;This case is not unlike Authority decisions ordering affirmative action by a respondent that, as a consequence, require an expenditure of funds.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award of interest was improper because Congress has excluded the Agency from the coverage of the BPA.

<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The BPA does not apply to the Agency as a matter of law. </span></p>

"In this regard, a collective bargaining agreement may require monetary payments to employees only where there is an underlying statutory authority for the payment." <span class="Italic">Minot,</span> 61 FLRA at 370 (citation omitted). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, an arbitrator's monetary remedy is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See DOT,</span> 52 FLRA at 49.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress enacted the DOT Act, which authorized the Agency to develop its PMS. <span class="Italic">See FAA,</span> 55 FLRA 1271, 1274-75 (2000) (Member Cabaniss concurring). The DOT Act also provided, in pertinent part, that Title 5 of the United States Code, with certain exceptions, did not apply to the PMS. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2); <span class="Italic">see also FAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 1274. The BPA was not one of the exceptions specified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Agency created its PMS, it established rules that allow Agency employees to obtain backpay in certain situations.<span class="Italic"> See </span>Award at 4 (citing PMS, Ch. II, &#x00A7; 9). However, the PMS does not permit interest for backpay paid by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Additionally, the Agency chose not to incorporate the BPA into its PMS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress subsequently amended &#x00A7; 347 of the DOT Act to extend additional portions of Title 5 to the PMS. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 104-122, 110 Stat. 876, codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2). Once again, Congress did not extend the BPA to the Agency; however, Congress did extend "chapter 71, relating to labor-management relations" to the Agency. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(C); <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 1274. Thus, the Agency is required to abide by the terms of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Congress has extended the <span class="Italic">Statute</span>, to the Agency, it has not extended the <span class="Italic">BPA itself</span> to the Agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(A)-(H) (listing only provisions of Title 5 that do apply to Agency). Therefore, apart from remedies of backpay awarded pursuant to the Statute, the Agency is exempt from the BPA. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">cf. Brown v. Sec'y of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 214, 216 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (concluding that BPA applied to matters arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because "text" of BPA provides "no hint of an exclusion of, or exemption for, federal sector Title VII adjudications[&#8197;]"). As such, the BPA does not apply to the Agency when the Agency <span class="Italic">itself</span> awards backpay to employees. The Agency awarded the grievant backpay under its PMS, not under the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Statute states that arbitrators may award grievants backpay "as provided in" the BPA. However, as stated above, the BPA does not apply to the Agency. Furthermore, the Arbitrator did not award any backpay under the BPA. Thus, there was no award of backpay "as provided in" the BPA in this case. As such, even assuming that &#x00A7; 7122(b) constitutes a requisite waiver of sovereign immunity for the payment of interest, it does not apply under the circumstances of this case because such a waiver could extend only as to an award of backpay made by an <span id="page_1976"></span>arbitrator and interest awarded by an arbitrator in conjunction with an award of backpay under the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The BPA does not apply to the Agency as a matter of contract. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, as a contractual matter, the grievant is entitled to interest on the backpay the Agency paid to her. "[A] collective bargaining agreement may require monetary payments to employees only where there is <span class="Italic">underlying statutory authority</span> for the payment." <span class="Italic">Minot,</span> 61 FLRA at 370 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The "statutory authority" that the Union relies on is the BPA; however, as we have already held, Congress has not made the BPA applicable to payments of backpay made by the Agency. Nevertheless, the Union maintains that the BPA applies to the Agency because the parties negotiated Article 37 of their agreement pursuant to the terms of the Statute, which is applicable to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Union relies upon the Statute as a waiver of sovereign immunity, the Authority has rejected the assertion that the Statute itself constitutes a waiver as to monetary damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Detroit, Mich.,</span> 64 FLRA 325, 329 (2009) (citing<span class="Italic"> Dep't of the Army,</span> 56 F.3d at 277).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question, therefore, is whether the parties may rely on the Statute to negotiate a general waiver of the Agency's sovereign immunity to monetary relief under the BPA. The federal courts and the Authority have not directly addressed this issue. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS v. FLRA,</span> 521 F.3d 1148, 1155 (9th Cir. 2008) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (in finding that Authority properly relied on Fair Labor Standards Act to find waiver of sovereign immunity, court noted, in dicta, that agency and union's contractual agreement was "plainly insufficient to show a waiver of sovereign immunity"); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 1156 (stating that "requisite statutory waiver" of sovereign immunity was "present, as opposed to an insufficient contractual waiver").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States may enter into contractual agreements, and be held liable for violations of the same, when Congress has enacted legislation permitting such agreements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. v. Navajo Nation,</span> 129 S. Ct. 1547, 1551-52 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Navajo</span>) (discussing waiver of sovereign immunity for contracts for Indian Tucker Act); <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Mitchell,</span> 463 U.S. 206, 215 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>) (discussing waiver of sovereign immunity for contracts under Tucker Act); <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 521 F.3d at 1153-54 (discussing waiver of sovereign immunity for contracts under Portal-to-Portal Act). Such legislation contains clauses that specifically permit the United States to be sued for violations of these agreements, and therefore, to be held liable for monetary remedies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Navajo,</span> 129 S. Ct. at 1552; <span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> 463 U.S. at 215; <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 521 F.3d at 1154. The Authority has held that the Statute constitutes a waiver of the Agency's sovereign immunity as to the BPA within the context of an unfair labor practice (ULP). <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 1271. However, this case does not involve an ULP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, "officers of the United States possess no power through their actions to waive [sovereign] immunity...in the absence of some express provision [of] Congress." <span class="Italic">U.S. v. NY. Rayon Importing Co.,</span> 329 U.S. 654, 660 (1947). Parties "entering into an agreement with the Government take[&#8197;] the risk of accurately ascertaining the authority of the agents who purport to act for the Government, and this risk remains with the contractor even when the Government agents themselves may have been unaware of the limitations on their authority." <span class="Italic">Harbert/Lummus Agrifuels Projects v. U.S.,</span> 142 F.3d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1998) <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 525 U.S. 1177 (1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Trauma Serv. Group v. U.S.,</span> 104 F.3d 1321, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). The Union has failed to cite to any provision in the Statute that expressly authorizes an agency head, or other agency official, contractually to waive an agency's sovereign immunity as to monetary relief under the BPA. Consequently, even if the Agency head approved this provision of the parties' agreement, that would provide no basis for concluding that the Agency waived sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as to the specific matter at issue, the Statute is subject to multiple plausible interpretations. Specifically, although an interpretation of the Statute as permitting contractual waivers of sovereign immunity is a plausible one, an equally plausible interpretation of the Statute is that it does not permit contractual waivers. If a statute has multiple plausible interpretations, then that statute cannot be considered definitive enough to constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See U.S. v. Nordic Village, Inc.,</span> 503 U.S. 30, 35 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Statute does not permit parties contractually to waive sovereign immunity as to the BPA in situations not specifically addressed by the Statute. The Union's arguments as to why we should permit a contractual waiver of sovereign immunity are unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union argues that the Agency is bound by the BPA because, pursuant to the terms of the Statute, the Agency negotiated its inclusion into the parties' agreement. However, as explained above, the Statute does not provide a basis for allowing parties contractually to waive sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union contends that the parties' agreement takes precedence over Agency rules; thus, the grievant is entitled to interest on her backpay even though the PMS prohibits it. To support this position, the Union relies on a decision in which the Authority held that language contained in a contract trumped a contrary Agency rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> Opp'n at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp.,</span> FAA, 61 FLRA 750, 752 (2006)). However, this decision is inapplicable because there was no question that the contract provision in that case was valid. Moreover, that provision did not purport to waive sovereign immunity. By contrast, we have held that the provision in dispute here does not validly waive sovereign immunity. Thus, the Union's argument does not support its position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, and finally, the Union asserts that the Agency's position should not be given deference because it is inconsistent with positions that it has taken in the past. Specifically, the Union contends that the Agency has previously relied on provisions of the BPA to overturn arbitration awards. Opp'n at 6-7 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA,</span> 63 FLRA 502 (2009); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Wash., D.C.,</span> 63 FLRA 492 (2009) (<span class="Italic">FAA, Wash., D.C.</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Airways Facility Serv., Nat'l Airway Sys., Eng'g Div., Okla. City, Okla.,</span> 60 FLRA 565 (2005) (<span class="Italic">FAA, Okla.</span>)). Even if it were appropriate to examine whether the Agency's arguments are entitled to deference, the Union's argument lacks merit because, in each of the decisions cited by the Union, the arbitrator awarded backpay, not the Agency. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA,</span> 63 FLRA at 502; <span class="Italic">FAA, Wash.</span>, D.C., 63 FLRA at 492; <span class="Italic">FAA, Okla.,</span> 60 FLRA at 567. Thus, the Agency's current position is not inconsistent with these decisions.</p>
