<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-295"><span class="space">6.</span> Summary Judgment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Summary judgment motions are appropriate in ULP cases and they are employed when facts are not in substantial dispute or when the respondent fails to timely answer the complaint. 5 CFR 2423.27 (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Summary judgment motions</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motions</span>. Any party may move for a summary judgment in its favor on any of the issues pleaded. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrative Law Judge, such motion shall be made no later than 10 days prior to the hearing. The motion shall demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Such motions shall be supported by documents, affidavits, applicable precedent, or other appropriate materials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responses</span>. Responses must be filed within 5 days after the date of service of the motion. Responses may not rest upon mere allegations or denials but must show, by documents, affidavits, applicable precedent, or other appropriate materials, that there is a genuine issue to be determined at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Decision</span>. If all issues are decided by summary judgment, no hearing will be held and the Administrative Law Judge shall prepare a decision in accordance with &#x00A7; 2423.34. If summary judgment is denied, or if partial summary judgment is granted, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an opinion and order, subject to interlocutory appeal as provided in &#x00A7; 2423.31(c) of this subchapter, and the hearing shall proceed as necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">Summary judgment motions can avoid useless, expensive, lengthy hearings if there are no issues of material fact to be tried. <span class="Italic">California NG and NAGE Local R12-125</span>, 8 FLRA 54, 60-61 (1982) (ALJ Decision). FLRA regulations permit the use of motions for summary judgment in the litigation of ULP charges and the practice is consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and principles of due process and administrative law. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Guard Bureau, Maine Air Nat'l Guard and AFGE Local 3013</span>, 10 FLRA 583, 593 n.2 (1982) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 4</span>, 37 FLRA 515, 522 (1990) ("the Judge did not err in granting the General Counsel's motion for summary judgment without directing a hearing in this case"). The close cousin of the summary judgment motion--the motion to dismiss a complaint--is not governed by any outer time limit. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Stewart Sch. and Ft. Stewart Ass'n of Educators, NEA</span>, 37 FLRA 409, 415-16 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Summary judgment may be appropriate when the respondent fails to answer the complaint. Then the allegations are deemed admitted, there is no issue of fact, and the case can be decided on the pleadings. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">VARO Philadelphia and AFGE Local 940</span>, 70 FLRA 776, 776 &#x0026; n.4 (2018) ("The Authority's Regulations require a party to file an answer within twenty days of being served with the complaint, absent a showing of 'good cause' for failing to do so. The Respondent failed to demonstrate good cause here. Further, under &#x00A7; 2423.20(b) of the Authority's Regulations, 'failure to file an answer or respond to any allegation <span class="Italic">shall constitute an admission</span>.'"; "Member Abbott notes that when parties cannot be bothered to answer complaints or otherwise comply with mandatory procedures, they also fail to 'contribute to the effective conduct of public business' and to facilitate and encourage 'the amicable settlement[&#8197;] of disputes' as required by our Statute."); <span class="Italic">VAMC Martinsburg and NFFE IAM Local 1798</span>, 66 FLRA 776 (2012) (granting summary judgment against agency when ALJ denied its counsel's request for extension of time to answer complaint and no timely answer was filed); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 1184 (2010) (summary judgment granted when response to the complaint was late and allegations of complaint were deemed admitted); <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-32 and Bouchard</span>, 54 FLRA 349, 352 (1998) (ALJ Decision). The agency's failure timely to respond to a ULP complaint resulted in summary judgment, with the comment in <span class="Italic">VA Denver Regional Office and AFGE Local 1557</span>, 70 FLRA 851, 851 &#x0026; n.3 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Many of the Union's alleged disputed facts are merely insinuations with no basis in the record or are blatantly contradicted by the record. The Union alleges that the officials from the former union "acted as agents of the Agency...in connection with the selection and appointment of arbitrators for the pool." However, the Union only supports this allegation with innuendo and blanket statements such as a declaration stating that a witness "ha[s] knowledge of the factual statements...based on direct knowledge and from documents that the [A]gency...provided to the Union" without actually producing any documents or stating this knowledge in the declaration. This blanket statement does not indicate what knowledge the witness could provide and does not create a genuine factual issue.[43] As such,[44] this alleged factual dispute and related alleged factual disputes do not present genuine disputes.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Respondent presented testimony disputing a number of factual assertions made by the General Counsel. Although the Judge found otherwise, our review of the transcript of the hearing persuades us that there was a genuine dispute over facts that were material to the General Counsel's showing, under section 7114(b)(4), that certain information was normally maintained and was reasonably available. Therefore, the Judge erred in granting the General Counsel's motion for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville</span>, <span class="Italic">Tennessee</span>, 50 FLRA 220, 222 (1995) (judge did not err in granting general counsel's motion for summary judgment and denying respondent's cross-motion for same because respondent failed to demonstrate that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding an affidavit on which the judge relied).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through summary judgment, the General Counsel obtained judgment after the respondent failed properly to respond to a complaint, constructively admitting the ULP allegations, <span class="Italic">EPA, Envtl. Research Lab., Narragansett and NAGE Local R1-240</span>, 49 FLRA 33, 33-36 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The consolidated complaint alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by counselling, admonishing and disciplining employees who engaged in lawful activity on behalf of an exclusive representative and by soliciting or encouraging employees to decertify the Charging Party as the exclusive representative of certain employees. The Respondent did not file an answer to the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel filed a Motion for Summary Judgment based on Respondent's failure to answer the complaint. The Motion was referred to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, who issued an Order granting all parties an opportunity to file briefs regarding the Motion. When the Respondent failed to respond to the Order, the Judge granted the General Counsel's Motion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to section 2423.29 of our Rules and Regulations and section 7118 of the Statute, we have reviewed the rulings of the Judge and find that no prejudicial error was committed. We affirm those rulings. Upon consideration of the Judge's decision and the entire record, we adopt the Judge's findings, conclusions, and recommended order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 12, 1993, the Regional Director of the Boston Regional Office of the Federal Labor Relations Authority issued a consolidated complaint and Notice of Hearing to the Respondent. The Respondent failed to file an answer to the complaint during the time period set forth in section 2423.13 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations and did not respond to the complaint thereafter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1578"></span>Subsequently, on July 13, 1993, Counsel for the General Counsel moved for summary judgment based on the Respondent's failure to file an answer to the consolidated complaint. The Regional Director referred the motion to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, in accordance with section 2423.22(b) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. Thereafter, the Chief Judge issued an Order granting all parties an opportunity until July 30, 1993, to file briefs regarding the motion. In response to the Order, Counsel for the General Counsel filed a timely brief with the Chief Judge. Respondent did not file any response with the Chief Judge, but, instead, on July 29, 1993, mailed its response to the Boston Regional Director. The Boston Regional Office did not forward the response to the Chief Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that, as he had received no reply from the Respondent to the Chief Judge's order, the Respondent had not shown good cause for its failure to answer the complaint. The Judge concluded that the undenied allegations of the consolidated complaint constituted admissions of fact which established violations of the Statute. Consequently, the Judge found that the Respondent had committed the alleged unfair labor practices. Accordingly, the Judge granted the General Counsel's Motion for Summary Judgment and recommended that the Respondent be ordered to take appropriate remedial action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions of the Parties</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent claims that it complied with the Chief Judge's Order by filing its "answer to the complaint" with the Boston Regional office. The Respondent further argues that the Boston Regional office should have forwarded its submission to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel states that the Respondent was required to file its response to the Chief Administrative Law Judge's Order with the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The General Counsel maintains that the Boston Regional Office was under no obligation to forward, and was not aware that it was expected to forward Respondent's response to the Chief Judge. The General Counsel also argues that, even if Respondent's submission were considered an "answer to the complaint" rather than a response to the Motion, a copy of the answer should have been served on the Chief Administrative Law Judge, as required by section 2423.13(a) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.24(d) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations states that "[a] document submitted to an Administrative Law Judge pursuant to this subchapter shall be filed with the appropriate Administrative Law Judge, as set forth in the Appendix." Appendix A(d) provides the complete address and telephone number of the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Chief Judge's Order plainly stated that the Chief Judge had jurisdiction over the Motion for Summary Judgment and clearly indicated the address of the Chief Judge. Consequently, we reject the Respondent's claim that the proper place of filing its response to the Chief Judge's Order was the Boston Regional Office. Parties filing actions with the Authority are responsible for being knowledgeable of the statutory and regulatory filing requirements....&#8197;As the Respondent's response to the Chief Judge's Order was not properly or timely filed, and as the Respondent has failed to answer the consolidated complaint, we find no basis on which to disturb the Administrative Law Judge's decision granting the General Counsel's Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>
