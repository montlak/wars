<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-263"><span class="space">b.</span> Compensatory Damages Under the Civil Rights Acts</h5>
<p class="noindent">Compensatory damages awards under the amended civil rights statutes <span id="page_2197"></span>were addressed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 372-74 (1996), involving an award finding that a grievant was the victim of racial discrimination when he was not selected for promotion. Setting aside an award of $5,000 in compensatory damages, FLRA explained the need for particularized findings by the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception to the Arbitrator's award of compensatory damages provides the Authority with an opportunity to address, for the first time, the requirements regarding awards of compensatory damages by arbitrators under section 102(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, Pub. L. No. 102-166, codified at 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a (section 102).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102(a) authorizes an award of compensatory damages as part of the make-whole relief for intentional discrimination in violation of Title VII. Compensatory damages are available to Federal employees who seek redress for intentional discrimination through an administrative process. <span class="Italic">McAdams v. Reno</span>, 858 F. Supp. 945, 950-51 (D. Minn. 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 10923399 (1992)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Totten v. United States Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 255, 257 n.2 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Hocker v. Department of Transportation</span>, 63 MSPR 497, 505 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of compensatory damages must be based on objective evidence.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288, slip op. at 4-5 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Lawrence</span>). In <span class="Italic">Lawrence</span>, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission defined objective evidence to include:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">statements from the complainant concerning his/her emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other nonpecuniary losses.... Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers could address the outward manifestations or physical consequences of emotional distress, including sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, emotional distress, loss of self-esteem, excessive fatigue, or a nervous breakdown. Objective evidence also may include documents indicating a complainant's actual out-of-pocket expenses related to medical treatment, counseling, and so forth, related to the injury allegedly caused by discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 5. The grievant's own testimony, along with the particular circumstances of the case, may be sufficient to sustain her burden of proving damages due to emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Balistrieri</span>, 981 F.2d 916, 932 (7th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 510 U.S. 812 (1993) (compensatory damages in context of claim of housing discrimination)); <span class="Italic">EEOC Compliance Manual</span>, Notice on Compensatory and Punitive Damages, N:6071, N:6081 (citing <span class="Italic">Williams v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 660 F.2d 1267, 1273 (8th Cir. 1981)); <span class="Italic">see also Phillips v. Hunter Trails Community Association</span>, 685 F.2d 184, 190-91 (7th Cir. 1982). However, where no objective evidence has been introduced upon which the fact-finder may conclude that the employee has suffered emotional distress as a result of an employer's discriminatory action, the employee may not recover damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gunby </span>v. <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania Electric Company</span>, 840 F.2d 1108, 1121-22 (3d Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 492 U.S. 905 (1989).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award of compensatory damages is legally deficient because he has not set forth the necessary and specific findings, including the identification of objective evidence as defined in <span class="Italic">Lawrence</span> above, which supports the award. In particular, the Arbitrator has not pointed to any testimonial or documentary evidence that establishes that the grievant is entitled to compensatory damages. Rather, he based the award of compensatory damages on the circumstances of the case, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the fact that the grievant was faced with the option of surrendering her rights or launching a lengthy adversarial process against individuals in Agency management who retain authority over her career. These findings are not sufficient to sustain an award of compensatory damages. Consequently, we remand that part of the award concerning compensatory damages to the parties to have them obtain a clarification of the award by the Arbitrator, who shall be guided by the criteria discussed in this section of the decision.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority thoroughly outlined the legal requirements for an award of compensatory damages as a remedy for racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b) in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent</span> <span class="Italic">and Trademark Office and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243, </span>52 FLRA 358, 372-74 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Patent and Trademark Office). </span>The Authority stated that "[a]n award of compensatory damages must be based on objective evidence<span class="Italic">."

In that case, the Authority held that the arbitrator's award of compensatory damages was legally deficient because he had not set forth the necessary specific findings, including the identification of objective evidence, which supports the award. Specifically, the Authority found that the arbitrator had not pointed to "any testimonial or documentary evidence" that established the grievant's entitlement to compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 374.

<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office, </span>the Arbitrator in this case cited no testimonial or documentary evidence in support of her award of compensatory damages. Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">Patent and</span> <span class="Italic">Trademark Office, </span>the award will be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator in order that they might obtain a clarification by the Arbitrator of the grievant's entitlement to compensatory damages applying the criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">PBGC and NAGE Local R3-77</span>, 64 FLRA 692, 699-70 (2010) (following remand, <span class="Italic">PBGC and NAGE Local R3-77</span>, 68 FLRA 916, 919-20 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), <span class="Italic">recon. den</span>., 69 FLRA 164 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting)), remanded a damages award under Title VII for more specific analysis by the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employer has been found to have violated Title VII, the employer is "liable only for those damages directly or proximately caused by" the employer's unlawful act. <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Cisneros,</span> EEOC Doc. 01961030 (1996). Where an employer's unlawful action is only partially responsible for an employee's damages, "damages must be reduced accordingly." <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Family Dollar Stores</span>, 103 F.3d 576, 581 (7th Cir. 1996). In this regard, where an employee "has a pre-existing condition, the [employer] is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination." <span class="Italic">Durrant v. West,</span> EEOC Doc. 01971885 at 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no basis in the remedy award or the record for finding that the Arbitrator complied with the above-cited precedent by reducing the grievant's damages to account for the confrontation, which he found not to violate Title VII. In this regard, the Arbitrator expressly found that the confrontation and the Title VII violation, "<span class="Italic">in combination</span>[,]" were "the proximate cause of the grievant's mental and emotional sufferings." Moreover, the record does not provide a sufficient basis for the Authority to determine the extent to which the grievant's damages were caused solely by the Title VII violation. Accordingly, we remand the remedial issues to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to clarify whether and to what extent the damages suffered by the grievant were related to the confrontation, and if they were so related, the extent to which the damages should be reduced. In so remanding, we note two additional principles that the Arbitrator should take into account on remand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the award of nearly $300,000 is similar to or greater than amounts that have been awarded in cases involving violations that were significantly different, in terms of severity or their ongoing nature, from the failure to investigate that is at issue here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fellows-Gilder v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070046 (January 31, 2008) (complainant was unlawfully terminated, resulting in hospitalization for writing a suicide note and developing plan to commit suicide, as well as need to seek public assistance and move to remote location); <span class="Italic">Burton v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720050066 (March 6, 2007) (complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment over several years and unlawfully removed from work projects, resulting in major depression and panic attacks); <span class="Italic">Cook v. Postmaster Gen.,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01950027, <span class="Italic">et al.</span> (July 17, 1998) (constant harassment over extended period of time caused complainant to become physically ill with recurring severe headaches, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and severe nervousness with uncontrollable shaking). Unlike the complainants at issue in those cases, the grievant was subjected to a discrete event that had a less significant impact on her employment conditions, specifically, an Agency failure to investigate an incident involving the temporary supervisor, with whom the grievant did not have an ongoing relationship. The Arbitrator should take this factor into account when reassessing damages on remand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, with regard to the award for loss of future employment opportunities, the EEOC "requires that the impairment of earning capacity be shown with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability, and there must be evidence which will permit the fact finder to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss." <span class="Italic">Ghazzawi v. Postmaster Gen.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A15327 at 6 (April 23, 2002) (citation omitted). It is unclear from the record what facts the Arbitrator relied on to determine that the grievant has been made less competitive for promotions and alternative employment. Accordingly, the Arbitrator should consider the above-quoted EEOC requirement on remand as well.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, Camp Lejeune Dependents Sch. and Lejeune Educ. Ass'n</span>, 57 FLRA 12, 18 (2001), determined that an arbitrator adequately explained an award of compensatory damages in a disability discrimination case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, unlike <span class="Italic">PTO</span>, the Arbitrator made sufficient findings to support the award of compensatory damages. In particular, the evidence set forth by <span id="page_2198"></span>the Arbitrator that formed the basis for his award included: testimony from the grievant's sisters, statements from the grievant's therapists and her medical doctor, medical documents, the grievant's own testimony, and the testimony of the Principal. Based upon that evidence, the Arbitrator held that "the record as a whole" "forcibly established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in support of the claimed compensation and that such body of evidence, in the main, has not been rebutted by the Agency." Consistent with the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Lawrence,</span> we conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator failed to base his award of compensatory damages on objective evidence. Therefore, as the Agency has not shown that the award is contrary to law, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a final point, insofar as the Agency alleges that the Arbitrator calculated the amount of compensatory damages to be awarded in a manner that was not in accordance with law, we reject that allegation. In this regard, the EEOC has stated that a proper award of nonpecuniary compensatory damages must meet two goals: (1) that it not be "monstrously excessive'" standing alone, and (2) that it be consistent with awards made in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Karin A. Leperi</span>, E.E.O.C. No. 01964107, slip op. at 15 (April 2, 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th cir. 1989)). Significantly, the Arbitrator found that "[t]he amount of compensation awarded is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases discussed in the briefs." [5] With regard to that finding, the Agency has not submitted any evidence demonstrating that the award is "monstrously excessive" or inconsistent with the range of amounts that have been awarded in cases such as this one. Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's calculation of the amount of compensatory damages is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Given the supporting evidence relied on by the Arbitrator, which included a diagnosis of severe depression, the compensatory damages awarded by him are within the range of damages awarded in cases similar to the grievant's in terms of harm sustained<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's finding of a retaliatory hostile work environment in connection with the 2011 grievance is contrary to the Civil Rights Act</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained the 2011 grievance's claim of a hostile work environment in retaliation for her 2003 reasonable-accommodation request (the 2011 retaliation finding), but the Agency contends that the grievant "failed to prove a causal link between her prior protected EEO activity and [her] adverse treatment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After finding that the grievant's 2003 reasonable-accommodation request was protected activity, the Arbitrator essentially concluded that any and all adverse treatment that the grievant suffered thereafter necessarily had some causal connection to her 2003 protected activity. But because the grievant's protected activity and adverse treatment occurred eight years apart, the Arbitrator's conclusion on causation required something more to support it.[16] None of the Arbitrator's other findings establish the necessary causal link. For example, the Arbitrator did not find that, after the grievant's 2003 reasonable-accommodation request, the supervisor treated the grievant worse than she had before that request. Nor did the Arbitrator explain why he concluded that the grievant's adverse treatment likely stemmed from her reasonable-accommodation request <span class="Italic">eight years earlier</span>.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf</span>., <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Garth N. v. Maybus</span>, EEOC Doc. 0120142878, 2017 WL 527271, at *5 (2017) ("[Causal] nexus may be shown by evidence that the adverse treatment followed the protected activity <span class="Italic">within such a period of time</span> and in such a manner that a retaliatory motive is inferred." (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;Contrary to the dissent's assertion, our analysis does not focus "solely" on temporal-proximity considerations. First, we note that, although the Arbitrator found that the supervisor treated the grievant poorly in several respects, the Arbitrator did nothing to <span class="Italic">link</span> that treatment to the grievant's earlier protected activity. He merely asserted, without support, that such a link existed based on the poor treatment itself. Second, we note that the lack of temporal proximity between the 2003 reasonable-accommodation request and the 2011 grievance likewise does not support finding a violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator's factual findings are insufficient to satisfy the causation standards for retaliation under the Civil Rights Act, we set aside the 2011 retaliation finding.[18] We likewise set aside the corresponding remedy of $225,000. Further, to the extent that the remedy of "pecuniary damages" for lost wages, therapy costs, medication expenses, and lost sick and annual leave applies to the time period covered by the 2011 grievance, we set aside that portion of the damages. Moreover, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to either reassign the supervisor outside the grievant's chain of command or permit the grievant to transfer to a budgeted position in a different Internal Revenue Service unit. As there is no longer a Civil Rights Act violation to support it,[21] we also set aside this remedy.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In connection with the 2012 grievance,[27] the Arbitrator found that the Agency's deliberate failure to engage in the interactive process and address the grievant's 2012 reasonable-accommodation request was a discrete act that violated the Rehabilitation Act (the discrete-act theory),[28] as well as proof of an ongoing hostile work environment that violated the Rehabilitation Act. Either theory will independently support the Arbitrator's award of $25,000.[30] We begin by examining the discrete-act theory of recovery.[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's determination that the 2012 grievance included a reasonable-accommodation request is based on a nonfact. To the extent that this determination is a factual finding, the parties disputed that issue below. As such, this argument does not provide a basis for finding that the award is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo</span>., 48 FLRA 589, 593-94 (1993). But even if we considered whether this determination was clearly erroneous, the plain wording of the grievance supports it. ("The Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act...when the [A]gency failed to follow the reasonable[-]accommodation process and provide accommodations necessary to ameliorate the grievant's medical condition."), 360 ("request[ing]...[pecuniary and c]ompensatory damages...for the physical and mental injuries [the grievant] has suffered...[under] the Rehabilitation Act").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g</span>., Award at 88 ("The Agency's failure to engage in the <span id="page_2199"></span>interactive process in this instance or to take steps to consider the reasonable accommodation request beyond a denial by inaction rises to discrimination based on...disability."); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 90 (finding that Agency "ignored or dismissed the [2012] reasonable[-]accommodation request[,] and...[this] disability discrimination justifies the smaller award of non-pecuniary damages").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Agency does not challenge the amount of these damages, but we note that the amount is less than awards in several comparable cases. <span class="Italic">E.g., Marguerite W. v. Perez</span>, EEOC Doc. 0120142727, 2016 WL 7666501, at *4 (2016) (awarding $30,000 for failure to engage in interactive process and make good-faith effort to accommodate employee over three months); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Austin, Tex</span>., 66 FLRA 228, 230 (2011) (discussing award of $35,000 for "unreasonable...delay" in providing reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;Under this theory, we will not address the Agency's challenges that concern only a hostile work environment, rather than a standalone denial of reasonable accommodation (i.e., discrete act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator erred when he found that the grievant raised a timely reasonable-accommodation claim in the 2012 grievance. But the Agency had reason to know, when it received the 2012 grievance, that it should have engaged the grievant in the interactive process to determine reasonable accommodation. Not only did the 2012 grievance refer to "reasonable accommodation" specifically, but it also expressly alleged that the Agency was in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.[33] Consistent with applicable precedent,[34] we uphold the Arbitrator's finding that the 2012 grievance triggered the Agency's interactive-process obligations.[35]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> Award at 84 (noting that "the 2012 grievance states in relevant part, 'The [A]gency violated the Rehabilitation Act...when the [A]gency failed to follow the reasonable[-]accommodation process and provide accommodation necessary to ameliorate the grievant's mental condition.'"); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 88.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency contends that the grievant's requested accommodations were not reasonable. But the Arbitrator credited the testimony of the Agency's reasonable-accommodation coordinator that the grievant identified "legitimate" bases for modifications, and that testimony is consistent with precedent from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that "[a]djusting supervisory methods is a form of reasonable accommodation."[38] As one example, the EEOC cited a modification that the grievant requested--to put "instructions...in writing."[39] Further, the grievant requested that her supervisor "stay out of [her] personal space...[and] speak to [her] in a normal, rather than a raised, tone of voice," which resembles an accommodation that a federal court found reasonable for someone with the same disabling conditions as the grievant.[41] As such, the Agency does not identify a basis for finding that providing the requested accommodations would have been unreasonable in the circumstances of this case.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;Further, the Agency has never asserted that providing the requested accommodations would constitute an "undue hardship." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 64 FLRA at 49 ("An agency commits unlawful discrimination by failing to reasonably accommodate a qualified individual with a known disability <span class="Italic">unless</span> the agency demonstrates that such accommodation would impose an <span class="Italic">undue hardship</span> on the agency." (emphases added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency argues that no objective evidence showed that the failure to address the 2012 accommodation request harmed the grievant. But the Arbitrator credited the letter from the grievant's physician, as well as the grievant's own testimony, that the supervisor's "behavior" not only "triggered [the grievant's] disability," but also "exacerbated" it. Because the Agency failed to explore accommodations, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency denied the grievant any "possibility of ameliorating" the conditions that exacerbated her disability. As such, we find that the Agency's failure to engage in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodation harmed the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we uphold the Arbitrator's findings that: (1) the Agency failed to engage in the interactive process; (2) the Agency's failure violated the Rehabilitation Act because there were reasonable modifications available to ameliorate the grievant's disability; and (3) the Agency's violation harmed the grievant. Thus, we reject the Agency's challenges to the award of $25,000.[48] And because the discrete-act theory of recovery is sufficient by itself to support the $25,000 award, we do not address the Agency's various challenges to the Arbitrator's alternate theory for awarding $25,000--a hostile work environment. However, we agree with the Agency that the 30% enhancement on damages that the Arbitrator awarded to cover tax consequences is unlawful here,[50] so we set aside that remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[48]&#x2003;As mentioned in note 30 above, the Agency does not challenge this specific amount of compensatory damages. Rather, the Agency argues that the Authority should set aside the $25,000 award because the failure to address the 2012 reasonable-accommodation request did not harm the grievant, and because the remedy constitutes unlawful "punitive damages" against the Agency. But we have rejected the Agency's argument about harm to the grievant. And we reject the Agency's punitive-damages argument because the Arbitrator clearly characterized this sum as "non-pecuniary damages," which are not punitive damages.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act for two reasons.&#x2003;First, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator awarded <span id="page_2200"></span>compensatory damages without addressing the responsibility of the grievant for the breakdown of the interactive process. However, the Arbitrator expressly acknowledged that the grievant's withdrawal of his first reasonable&#8209;accommodation request "unnecessarily confused the process." Nevertheless, the Arbitrator found that, overall, the grievant was "ready, willing[,] and able to participate" in the interactive process, and the Agency failed to make a good&#8209;faith effort to participate in that process.[22] Thus, the argument that the Arbitrator failed to address the grievant's responsibility is based on a misunderstanding of the award that provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency asserts that the amount of the Arbitrator's compensatory&#8209;damages award fails to account for the "substantial period of time when [the grievant] bore responsibility for the breakdown of the interactive process." Initially, it is worth noting that the Arbitrator did not find that the grievant's actions delayed the interactive process for a "substantial period of time." Further, the Arbitrator found that the <span class="Italic">Agency's</span> "failure to engage in the interactive process was the reason [that the g]rievant was not granted an accommodation," thereby establishing that the Agency bore most of the blame for the breakdown in the interactive process.[27] Moreover, in calculating an appropriate damages amount, the Arbitrator repeatedly stated that he considered the grievant's actions in arriving at an appropriate sum.[28] Thus, the Agency's argument to the contrary rests on a misunderstanding and fails to establish that the award is contrary to law.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator erred when he found that the Agency engaged in disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination because the grievants did not make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of either type of discrimination. In order to find disparate treatment or disparate impact discrimination, the Arbitrator was required to find that the grievants are members of a protected class. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973) (disparate treatment discrimination); <span class="Italic">Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 361 (1977) (disparate impact discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency discriminated against the grievants because they were recruited from Puerto Rico, rather than the continental United States, to work in Puerto Rico. He justified his characterization of this group as within the protected class of national origin based on his "arbitral notice" that "in a sociological sense" Puerto Ricans consist of two national origin groups--one residing in Puerto Rico and the other residing on the mainland. This reasoning is contrary to how the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Supreme Court define "national origin."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In interpreting Title VII, the EEOC defines "national origin" "as including, but not limited to, the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual's, or his or her ancestor's, <span class="Italic">place of origin</span>; or because an individual has the physical, cultural[,] or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.1 (emphasis added). Place of residency is not included in the EEOC's definition. Likewise, the Supreme Court, in interpreting Title VII, defines "national origin" as "the country where a person was born, or, more broadly, the country from which his or her ancestors came." <span class="Italic">Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co.</span>, 414 U.S. 86, 88 (1973) (emphasis added). Place of residence is not in the Supreme Court's definition of "national origin." Thus, the Arbitrator's view that the grievants make up a protected "national origin" class is unsupported.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that Puerto Ricans comprise one protected class based on national origin.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., De la Cruz v. N.Y.C. Human Res. Admin. Dep't of Soc. Servs.</span>, 82 F.3d 16, 20 (2d Cir. 1996) (finding that, as a Puerto Rican, plaintiff was a member of a protected class); <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Frank</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891512, 1989 WL 1005776, at *4 (1989); <span class="Italic">Bass v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01830151, 1983 WL 412697, at *2 (1983). However, according to the Union's own evidence, the Agency did not discriminate against this class. Indeed, the class was treated favorably as the percentages of recipients of home leave, PX privileges, and DoD school access who were of Puerto Rican and Hispanic national origin were 81, 84, and 86, respectively. Consequently, because the Agency did not violate the grievants' rights under Title VII, the Arbitrator's award of non-pecuniary damages is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MDC Guaynabo and AFGE Local 4052</span>, 68 FLRA 960, 963-66 (2015), set aside an award of damages (or equivalent equitable relief) for lack of a proper tie to a Title VII violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII is a waiver of sovereign immunity.[51] Title VII provides for compensatory damage awards against defendants--including federal government agencies--for "intentional discrimination " in violation of Title VII.[52] Under Title VII, an employee must establish that an employer "discriminate[d] against [the] individual...because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."[53] There are several theories of discrimination under Title VII. For one, the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII prohibits employer acts that "discriminate against" an employee because that employee "opposed any practice" made unlawful by Title VII or "made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in [a Title VII] investigation, proceeding, or hearing."[54] For another, to find disparate treatment or disparate impact discrimination, Title VII requires an arbitrator to find that the grievants are members of a protected class.[55] However, when an employer has been found to have violated Title VII, it is "liable only for those damages directly or proximately caused by" the employer's unlawful act.[56]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We first address whether the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings support finding a Title VII violation. In Award I, the Arbitrator found that "the grievant has suffered from discrimination and reprisals...prohibited by Title VII" and that "the retaliatory acts of [the lieutenant]" violated Title VII. However, the Arbitrator found that "compensatory damages...should not be awarded in the present case." Consistent with this statement, the Arbitrator based his monetary remedy to the grievant on other findings. Specifically, in Award III, the Arbitrator based this monetary award on the Agency's: (1) "failure to submit the [p]rotocol ordered by the Arbitrator" in <span id="page_2201"></span>Award I, causing the grievant "considerable anxiety"; (2) failure to apply its anti-sexual-harassment policy, causing the grievant harm in his capacity as a Union official; (3) failure to treat the grievant "fairly and equitably"; and (4) failure to comply with the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the Arbitrator's various awards nor the record support a finding that the grievant's monetary remedy is based on a Title VII violation. With regard to retaliation, the Union did not show that the Agency "discriminate[d] against" the grievant because he "opposed any practice" made unlawful by Title VII or "made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in [a Title VII] investigation, proceeding, or hearing."[65] As for disparate treatment or disparate impact discrimination, although the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency failed to comply with the parties' agreement, which includes language similar to Title VII, the Arbitrator did not find, and the Union does not claim, that the grievant is a member of a protected group or that any alleged discrimination against the grievant was causally related to the grievant's membership in such a group.[66] Thus, even if the Agency violated the parties' agreement, there is no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator found a Title VII violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[65]&#x2003;42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Union fails to demonstrate that a Title VII violation was the basis for the Arbitrator's monetary remedy to the grievant.[67] For this reason, the Union has not established that Title VII waives sovereign immunity for the monetary remedy. Nor does the Union allege that there is any other applicable statutory waiver.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that where a monetary remedy fails to satisfy the requirements of a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, and no other statutory waiver of sovereign immunity is present, the Authority will set aside the remedy.[68] Accordingly, we find that the $40,000 awarded to the grievant is contrary to law, and we set aside the portion of Award III that gives the grievant that monetary remedy.[69]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union concedes that the Arbitrator did not cite any statutory basis for the monetary remedy awarded to bargaining-unit members, but suggests that Title VII may apply. To the extent that the Union is citing Title VII as a waiver of sovereign immunity, we examine the Arbitrator's findings under the standards for assessing a Title VII claim set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator based the monetary remedy awarded to bargaining-unit members on the "diminished...capacity of the Union to act effectively to implement the legal and contractual rights of its members" because of the Agency's actions towards the grievant. As another basis for this remedy, the Arbitrator found that the Union and its members were harmed by a "broken arbitration system" caused by the Agency's violations of the parties' agreement. However, the Arbitrator does not state, and the record does not support the conclusion, that Title VII violations provide a waiver of sovereign immunity for the award of a monetary remedy to bargaining-unit members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union does not cite any other waiver of sovereign immunity supporting this remedy, and no other basis for waiving sovereign immunity is apparent, we find that the monetary remedy awarded to bargaining-unit members is contrary to law.[74] Accordingly, we set aside that portion of Award III.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar the Agency from compensating the Union and its bargaining-unit members because the monetary awards are equitable in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sovereign immunity does not apply where a monetary award is equitable in nature.[76] In <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison</span>), the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that, absent a waiver, monetary awards that are "legal" in nature are barred by sovereign immunity, but monetary awards that are "equitable" in nature are not.[77] The court determined that a monetary award is legal in nature when it is a substitute for the plaintiff's loss in consequence of the defendant's action.[78] In contrast, a monetary award is equitable in nature when it "does not attempt to provide the injured party with a substitute for a consequential loss, but rather 'attempt[s] to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled."'[79]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the definition of monetary awards that are legal in nature from <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison</span>, the remedies awarded to the Union and bargaining-unit members in this case are legal, rather than equitable. As compensation for a "broken arbitration system," the Union received $500,000 to be used for an "educational program." Similarly, bargaining-unit members were awarded up to $5,000 each because the "broken arbitration system" deprived them of "a fair and effective arbitration process." Accordingly, the Arbitrator awarded compensation to the Union and bargaining-unit members for a suffered loss, rather than the very thing to which they were arguably entitled.[82]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union cites <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Renton, Washington</span> (<span class="Italic">FAA Renton</span>),[83] that decision is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">FAA Renton</span>, the Authority found that sovereign immunity did not apply to a remedy that required the agency to obtain parking for employees at a location other than the location the agency made available at no cost to employees.[84] In upholding the administrative law judge's finding that the agency had failed to comply with an arbitration award, the Authority determined that the remedy was equitable in nature because it was the very thing to which the employees were entitled under the award.[85] By contrast, here, the Arbitrator awarded monetary remedies as compensation for a "broken arbitration system," rather than the very thing to which the Union and its bargaining-unit members were entitled.[87]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union requests that the Authority remand the award to the Arbitrator so that he can clarify the bases for these remedies.&#x2003;The Authority generally will remand an award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for clarification when the Authority is unable to determine if the award is deficient.[90] But, as discussed above, even applying Title VII--the only legal authority that the Union raises--neither the Arbitrator's awards nor the record support a finding that the Arbitrator's monetary remedies are based on a Title VII violation. And the Union does not allege that there is any other applicable waiver of sovereign immunity supporting these monetary remedies. Consequently, for the reasons discussed above, we find that there is a clear basis for finding that the Arbitrator's monetary remedies are contrary to law.
