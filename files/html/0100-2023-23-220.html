<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-219a"><span id="Page_5132"></span><span class="space">l.</span> Adjustment of Performance Appraisal, Documentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a document often relied on in the job application process, the appellant's most recent performance appraisal, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 485, 486-88 (1995) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 91 F.3d 117, 119-20 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">post</span>; following remand, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 103, 106-07 (1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>), required that parties seeking to adjust appraisals through settlements specifically state their intent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was demoted from the position of Supervisory Environmental Engineer, GM-14, to Industrial Engineering Technician, GS-11, Step 10, based on alleged reckless disregard of duties. She timely appealed the agency's action to the Board's Atlanta Regional Office. In an initial decision issued on March 28, 1994, the Board's administrative judge found that the appellant did not recklessly disregard the duties of her position and reversed the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Manley v. Air Force</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT0752940199-I-1 (Mar. 28, 1994). The administrative judge ordered the agency to cancel the demotion and award the appellant back pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filed a petition for review with the full Board seeking to overturn the initial decision and affirm the agency's demotion action. The petition for review was withdrawn pursuant to a settlement agreement in which the appellant agreed to accept another assignment. The agreement also provided that the appellant could contest the validity of her 1993 performance appraisal in the appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an Order issued on August 31, 1994, the Board found that the agreement was lawful on its face, that the parties freely entered into it, and that the subject matter was within the Board's jurisdiction.... The agreement was entered into the record for enforcement purposes. The Order specifically stated that the petition for review was dismissed as settled and that it was the final order of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for enforcement, the appellant argued that the agency was in noncompliance because it had not changed the ratings in her 1993 performance appraisal. These ratings were lower than they should be, the appellant argued, because they were based on conduct the administrative judge did not sustain in the adjudication of her demotion. The agency responded that the appellant must only be returned to the status she held prior to the adverse action and not to the status held before the alleged misconduct. Because the performance appraisal was issued prior to the adverse action, the agency maintained that it acted properly in retaining the pre-demotion ratings in her performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Normoyle v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 63 MSPR 391 (1994), the administrative judge held that the agency could not rely on the misconduct underlying the demotion to justify the negative performance appraisal. The administrative judge determined that all references to the alleged misconduct should be purged from the performance appraisal and that the ratings on certain elements should be changed. The administrative judge recommended that the agency be required to delete all references to the misconduct from the performance appraisal and increase the appellant's rating to "exceeded" on elements 3, 4, and 7, which was the rating on the appellant's 1992 performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision found that the appellant's demotion was unwarranted and ordered the agency to restore the appellant to her former position. However, because the agency filed a petition for review, the initial decision never became final. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.113(a). During the adjudication of the agency's petition for review, the parties negotiated a settlement agreement. Consequently, the Board did not decide the agency's petition for review, but instead issued a final Order admitting the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement and dismissing the petition for review as settled. <span class="Italic">See Rhodes v. US Postal Service</span>, 12 MSPB 137, 13 MSPR 584, 586 (1982). Accordingly, the resolution of the appeal on the basis of the settlement agreement constitutes the Board's final decision, and it is the settlement agreement that is enforceable as the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">See Richardson</span> <span class="Italic">v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement here addressed the appellant's reassignment to another position, but did not provide her any enforceable rights with respect to the performance appraisal. Although the agreement provided that the appellant could challenge her performance appraisal in an appropriate forum, the Board is not the appropriate forum. The issues surrounding the appellant's performance appraisal are not independently appealable to the Board, and the Board will not reopen and review issues surrounding an action which has been settled. <span class="Italic">See Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 372-73 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 MSPR 252 (1994), <span class="Italic">citing Nelson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 27 MSPR 133, 135 (1985). Because the parties did not enter into an enforceable agreement concerning the appellant's performance appraisal, there is nothing for the Board to enforce, and the issue is outside our jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Harrison v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 MSPR 594, 599 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On court review, however, the Board was directed to reexamine Manley's complaint concerning her performance appraisal, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 91 F.3d 117, 119-20 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 103, 106-07 (1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly held that disagreement with a performance evaluation, unaccompanied by an otherwise appealable adverse action, is not independently appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. However, when the issue is compliance with a settlement agreement, compliance review is not limited to those aspects of the settlement for which an independent appeal is available. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Board has jurisdiction to enforce compliance with settlement agreement requiring agency to provide neutral reference to prospective employers, a matter not independently appealable to the Board); <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Board has enforcement authority over settlement agreement providing priority consideration for a job even though the right to such consideration is not an independent basis for Board review); <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span>, 63 MSPR 391 (Board has authority to consider whether performance appraisal must be changed to comply with settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, in denying jurisdiction, stated that "the parties did not enter into an enforceable agreement concerning the appellant's performance appraisal." Indeed, the Settlement Agreement does not explicitly mention the performance appraisal. However, the Settlement Agreement provided that Ms. Manley may "move for compliance with the Board's final decision with respect to any aspect of the Board's order other than the agreement regarding appellant's assignment." Thus the Settlement Agreement, in its reference to the Board's order, incorporates the administrative judge's finding that Ms. Manley "did not recklessly disregard the duties of her position," the administrative judge then holding that this finding rendered the adverse action unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Manley states that because the Settlement Agreement was premised on the administrative judge's decision that the demotion was unwarranted, the agency was required, in resolving her grievance, to return her performance evaluation to that which would have prevailed in the absence of the misconduct of which she was vindicated. Precedent is in her favor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (a removal cancellation requires "as far as possible, a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>"); <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span>, 63 MSPR at 393-94 ("An agency is required, when a Board decision overturns a removal, to return the employee as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>."). The agency's refusal to adjust the performance evaluation to remove adverse appraisals that had been based on allegations not sustained by the Board is inimical to a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Thus, compliance with the Settlement Agreement requires that any mention of the unsustained charges, and any ratings based on those charges, be expunged from Ms. Manley's 1993 performance evaluation. The Board has jurisdiction to require compliance with the settlement, and thus has jurisdiction to determine whether the settlement has been complied with. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1577 ("If the MSPB approves the settlement agreement and makes it part of the record, the MSPB 'retain[s] jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement.'") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provision in the Settlement Agreement stating that Ms. Manley "could contest her 1993 performance evaluation in a proper forum" does not defeat Board jurisdiction of the issue of compliance with the Settlement Agreement. Ms. Manley explains, and the agency agrees, that this provision was included in the Agreement in recognition of the previously filed and stayed grievance proceeding. That recognition does not bar Ms. Manley from challenging the agency's compliance with the Settlement Agreement based on her charge that the agency's grievance decision did not comport with the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does the August 1, 1994 joint letter deprive the Board of jurisdiction of the enforcement petition. Indeed, the letter reinforces the contrary conclusion. The letter from both parties, addressed to the MSPB and written after the settlement agreement, lists four issues that "the Board will retain enforcement authority over." Included is "the removal of records from any official files referencing appellant's demotion or her proposed removal." Ms. Manley's performance evaluation and the ensuing records of demotion are within the scope of this item.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not consider Ms. Manley's argument that the Settlement Agreement was subverted by the agency's handling of her grievance. The Settlement Agreement provides the Board with jurisdiction of issues of compliance with the Agreement, whether or not such issues would otherwise be appealable. The Agreement requires that Ms. Manley's 1993 performance evaluation be free of any taint of the unsustained charges. Thus, the Board erred in declining to exercise jurisdiction of the petition for compliance. We reverse that decision, and remand to the Board for <span id="Page_5133"></span>review of the appeals of both parties on the merits of the administrative judge's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the return of the appraisal dispute to the Board following court review, the Board traced the prior treatment of the dispute, as it explained the parameters of the AJ's consideration, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 103, 106-07 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the reversal of an adverse action, the appellant must be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for</span> <span class="Italic">the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In the instant case, the administrative judge correctly determined that the agency must revise the appellant's 1993 performance appraisal to take into account the Board's decision finding the agency did not establish that the appellant recklessly disregarded the duties of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the Board's holding on the charged conduct has no bearing on the appellant's performance appraisal because the appraisal was not based on the actual adverse action as was the case in <span class="Italic">Normoyle v. Department of the Air Force</span>, which was relied upon by the administrative judge. However, the agency reads <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span> too narrowly. The Board in <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span>, held that an appellant who has an adverse action reversed may not be evaluated based on the charges and allegations that were not sustained in the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span>, 63 MSPR at 394-95, <span class="Italic">citing Zamora v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 58 MSPR 544 (1993) (in a case where the penalty was the subject of a settlement agreement, the lowering of an appraisal based on the same allegations of misconduct is an improper additional penalty). Similarly, the Court in this case stated, "[t]he agency's refusal to adjust the performance evaluation to remove adverse appraisals that had been based on allegations not sustained by the Board is inimical to a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." <span class="Italic">Manley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 91 F.3d 117, 119 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Therefore, the administrative judge correctly held that the agency must remove from the appellant's appraisal all references to the unsustained action, charges, and allegations. Since the agency has failed to do this, we find the agency in noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that a reappraisal in accordance with this decision will not result in a change of the appellant's overall rating. This is because even absent consideration of the conduct surrounding the unsustained charge, the appellant received a "did not meet" in two critical elements which prevents a rating other than "unacceptable." Since the reasons explaining why the appellant received a "did not meet" rating in elements one and two were unrelated to the reversed agency action, the agency is not required to alter them based on the reversal of the agency action. <span class="Italic">See Normoyle v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 63 MSPR 391, 396 (1994) (appellant is not protected from the deficiencies of her performance that were unrelated to the agency action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we disagree with the administrative judge's analysis regarding the proper rating that the appellant should receive in elements 3, 4, and 7, in which the agency erroneously considered actions that were the basis of the unsustained charge. The administrative judge found that the appellant should receive the same rating that she received in the preceding appraisal period on these elements, "exceeded." The Board in <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span> did apply that approach, but the facts in that case differ from the ones present here. Unlike the appellant here, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span> was absent for seven months of the appraisal period because of the agency's improper action. Further, the agency in <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span> specifically stated that it had not observed the appellant sufficiently to appraise her performance for the period in question. The agency did not otherwise justify its lowered evaluation, and thus the rating was clearly not based on the appellant's performance during the evaluation period. Therefore, the Board found that the appellant was entitled to the same rating she had received in the prior appraisal period because this was the only basis for measurement of performance. <span class="Italic">Normoyle</span>, 63 MSPR at 396. However, in this case the appellant was on the job the entire rating period, and the agency's evaluation is based on her performance during the relevant time period. Thus, there is a basis for properly evaluating the appellant's performance, and automatically giving the appellant the same rating as she received in her prior evaluation is not required. What is required is that the appellant receive the same rating she would have received absent consideration of the unsustained conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record is insufficient to determine the appellant's appropriate rating, and therefore this case must be remanded for evidence and argument regarding what rating the appellant would have received if the agency had not considered the unsustained allegations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pagan v. VA</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1369-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (a "clean record" settlement required the agency to provide information to prospective employers that cast references in a positive tone and to avoid references that would alert a future employer to a past problem with the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declined to direct an agency to rescind a notification of denial of a step increase, even though the parties settled a (presumably related) performance-based action by agreeing to remove from the OPF a record of the removal proposal and decision, <span class="Italic">Priselac v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 11, 1997, the agency removed Ms. Priselac from her position for unacceptable performance. Ms. Priselac appealed her removal to the Board. On September 22, 1997, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which rescinded the removal and provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Agency will remove from [Ms. Priselac's] Official Personnel File all references to the proposed removal, the effected removal, and [Ms. Priselac's] placement on a Performance Improvement Plan on or after July 17, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also agreed to process the necessary paperwork to effectuate the foregoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to her removal, Ms. Priselac became eligible for a within-grade-increase (WIGI) on October 1, 1995. However, the agency denied the WIGI in a Notification of Personnel Action dated July 17, 1996 (Notification). The reason for the denial was that Ms. Priselac's work was not at "an acceptable level of competence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the case was settled, Ms. Priselac petitioned the Board for enforcement of the settlement agreement alleging, among other things, that the agency had failed to reinstate her at the proper step within her grade. Specifically, she contended that the agency was required under the settlement agreement to remove the Notification from her personnel file. Without the Notification, Ms. Priselac argued, there was no basis for concluding that she was performing at a less than acceptable level and denying her the WIGI. The Board held that the agency was not under any obligation under the settlement agreement to remove the Notification or rescind the WIGI denial and denied the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Priselac argues that the Board erred in concluding that the agency was not required under the settlement agreement to remove the Notification from her personnel file. The settlement agreement requires the agency to remove from the file all references to the removal action. The settlement agreement does not require the removal of other documents from the Ms. Priselac's file, such as the Notification. Therefore the Board did not err in concluding that the agency was not required to remove the Notification from Ms. Priselac's file. Because Ms. Priselac's argument that the WIGI denial should be rescinded depends on the removal of the Notification, the Board did not err in leaving the WIGI denial in place.</p>
