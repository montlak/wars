<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-157"><span class="space">c.</span> Right to Silence, Counsel</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions earlier discussed assume a noncustodial interrogation that requires the employee to answer questions that may incriminate him or lead to the loss of his job if he refuses to answer. A custodial interrogation, adding the coercive element of detention, requires the interrogator to warn the employee that the employee has the right to counsel during the interrogation and that he has the right to remain silent as to matters that might be incriminating. A decision of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 47 FLRA 370, 375 n.2 (1993), explained the nature of a <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Miranda</span>, in a criminal case, statements obtained during custodial interrogation of a defendant may not be utilized unless prior to the questioning the person is "warned that he (or she) has a right to remain silent, that any statement he (or she) does make may be used as evidence against him (or her), and that he (or she) has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed." <span class="Italic">Miranda</span>, 384 U.S. at 444.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moulding v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 52 MSPR 19, 22-23 (1991), commented on criminal investigations conducted by agency security personnel, without saying much about the conduct of the investigation or questioning except that it involved an off-duty admission relating to a drug search of the appellant's residence by the agency Office of Special Investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well established that where an individual is subject to a custodial interrogation, any inculpatory statements may not be used unless the individual is provided the procedural protections against self-incrimination set forth in <span class="Italic">Miranda v. Arizona</span>, 384 U.S. at 444-45 [(1966)]. <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Muniz</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2638 (1990); <span class="Italic">Rhode Island v. Innis</span>, 446 U.S. 291, 297 (1980). This rule applies to all custodial interrogations where criminal prosecution could result, even if the interrogation is administrative in nature. <span class="Italic">Beckwith v. United States</span>, 425 U.S. 341, 347 (1976) (IRS interrogation of a taxpayer suspected of tax fraud); <span class="Italic">Mathis v. United States</span>, 391 U.S. 1, 4 (1968) (same). The Board has applied the Supreme Court's holding to Federal employees subject to a custodial interrogation by their employing agency where criminal charges could result. e.g., <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 174, 178 (1989)...<span class="Italic">Connett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 322, 327 (1986)...<span class="Italic">Chisolm v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 116, 120 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gamber v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 142, 145-46 (1993), quoting <span class="Italic">Moulding</span> with approval, determined that an individual received <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings, but added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that where an individual is subject to a custodial interrogation, any inculpatory statements may not be used unless the individual is provided the procedural protections against self-incrimination set forth in <span class="Italic">Miranda</span>.... This rule applies to all custodial interrogations when criminal prosecution could result, even if the interrogation is administrative in nature....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The right to counsel does not arise in the ordinary noncustodial agency administrative investigatory interview. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Howard v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 617, 621 (1986). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. Goodstein</span>, 680 F.2d 243 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (recognizing the general rule requiring notice of a right to counsel in administrative proceedings that might lead to criminal liability; reversing an arbitration award that in turn set aside an adverse action for the failure to provide notice of a right to counsel when there could have been no reasonable belief of the possibility of criminal prosecution); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hylick v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 MSPR 145, 151 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2000) (agency policy that could be interpreted to require a Fifth Amendment warning when an employee became "suspect" in a criminal proceeding was not invoked when the employee may have been suspected of making false statement to the investigator about past noncriminal conduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DiMasso v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 526, 528 (Fed. Cir. 1984), involved an air traffic controller who contended that the agency committed harmful error by failing to inform him of the constitutional right against self-incrimination. The Federal Circuit provided further explanation of the June 4, 1980, memorandum by Attorney General Civiletti (quoted earlier) outlining general guidelines for procedures in administrative investigations of certain employee misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In DiMasso's situation, his opportunity to respond to a notice of proposed removal did not reach the level of a custodial interrogation. He was not compelled to give testimony as a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for retaining his job; he was free to deny participation in an illegal strike but chose not to do so. Moreover, even if one were to assume that the Attorney General's memorandum was binding (which it was not), then the probable consequences of an agency's failing to follow that document would be felt not in these civil removal proceedings but in any subsequent criminal investigation (citing <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beck v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 219, 222 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings were not required in a noncustodial investigatory interview).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A letter carrier, accused of discarding deliverable mail, was not improperly denied <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> rights during an investigation by the agency, <span class="Italic">Crew v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although petitioner asserts a violation of his "Miranda" rights, we review his appeal as though he asserted a violation of his right to counsel during custodial interrogations in civil investigations which may result in criminal prosecution. <span class="Italic">Oregon v. Mathiason</span>, 429 U.S. 492 (1977). The Board correctly held in <span class="Italic">Chisolm v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 116, 7 MSPB 42, 44 (1981), that "an employee does not have a <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> right to counsel in any agency investigative interview unless: (1) the investigation may result in criminal prosecution; and (2) the interrogation takes place while the employee is in custody."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a general proposition, there is no right to counsel if statements are taken during the investigative stage of an administrative proceeding. <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 149, 151 (1986). Before <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings become an issue, the appellant must actually be in custody, <span class="Italic">Long v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 244, 247 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Miranda,</span> the Court held that there was a right to counsel attendant to the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment. The <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> right to counsel applies to civil investigations which may result in criminal prosecutions, <span class="Italic">Mathis v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 391 U.S. 1, 4, 88 S. Ct. 1503, 1504, 20 L. Ed.2d 381 (1968), <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 7 MSPB 42, 44, 7 MSPR 116, 120 (1981), but <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> rights are limited to custodial interrogations. <span class="Italic">Oregon v.

In this case, it is clear that at the time the VA Police Chief asked appellant if <span id="Page_1598"></span>the coat belonged to him, appellant was not in the custody of the police. Nor was he the subject or focus of an agency investigation. The officer's question was merely a preliminary inquiry. Once appellant responded that the coat belonged to him, he was immediately advised of his rights after which appellant was asked no more questions....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an employee has a right to <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings if he is asked questions that may result in criminal prosecution and the interrogation takes place while the employee is in custody, testimony taken in these circumstances will be accepted by the Board if <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings are issued and the appellant waives his rights to counsel and to remain silent. The waiver, however, must be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 174, 178 (1989); <span class="Italic">Chisolm v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 116, 120, 7 MSPB 42 (1981) (involving a custodial investigation by postal inspectors that could have resulted in criminal prosecution).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The element of custody involves the deprivation of an individual's liberty or freedom of action, in any significant way, during questioning by law enforcement officers. <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 732, 735, 6 MSPB 611 (1981). The individual's erroneous belief that he is in custody or under arrest is insufficient to trigger explicit or implicit <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> protections. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 607, 610 (1986) (admissions of an appellant's misconduct would not be stricken); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Stansbury v. California</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1526 (1994) (reviewing <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> and explaining that custody is ascertained by objective circumstances and not by the opinion of the interrogating officer as to the guilt of the suspect).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some decisions earlier discussed--particularly those involving searches--cast doubt on even the custody exclusion: the reasoning likely to be applied by the Board is that rules governing criminal investigations are inapplicable to administrative proceedings; the information developed in those proceedings cannot be used in criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> problems aside, the matter of compelled testimony is confusing because the decisions are unclear. Even if the individual is interrogated while in custody and not provided the <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings, the case is not at an end; it must be determined whether the agency relied on information gained from the custodial interview. If the information supporting the action was not gained from the interview but was developed from independent sources, then there is no harmful error in the manner of the appellant's questioning during the investigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 461, 462 n.* (1983) (even if the confession was excluded, there was a videotape of the appellant's conversation with her supervisor); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 686, 689 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">Wong Sun v. United States</span>, 371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963), and concluding that "it is clear that none of the evidence relied on, either in the agency's determination to remove appellant, or in the hearing before the Board, was drawn from appellant's custodial interview.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board synthesized <span class="Italic">Miranda</span>, <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>, <span class="Italic">Gardner</span>, and <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men</span>, in <span class="Italic">Tannehill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 219, 222-24 (1993), rejecting a challenge to evidence that led to the appellant's removal for drug-related offenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Boso did not advise the appellant of his rights under the Fifth Amendment. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Miranda v. Arizona</span>, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed.2d 694 (1966) (the Fifth Amendment requires law-enforcement officials conducting a custodial interrogation to advise the subject of his constitutional right not to incriminate himself). It is also undisputed, though, that Boso told the appellant at the outset of the February 12, 1992 interview that he was not under arrest, that he did not have to answer any questions, and that he was free to leave. In other words, Boso did not question the appellant in a custodial setting. Under these circumstances, the fact that the appellant was not given a <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warning does not render his statement inadmissible in these proceedings. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 174, 178 (1989) (an employee's pre-removal statement, given during custodial detention to agency investigators, may be used against the employee in Board proceedings only if the employee waived his or her Fifth Amendment rights), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 904 F.2d 46 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Connett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 322, 327 (1986) (if an employee gives a statement to agency officials in a non-custodial setting, the agency may use the statement against the employee in Board proceedings regardless of whether it gave the employee a <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warning), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 824 F.2d 978 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his statement should nonetheless be considered the product of coercion because the agency could have removed him if he had refused to answer Boso's questions. The appellant relies primarily on <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S. Ct. 616, 17 L. Ed.2d 562 (1967), where the court held that statements made by public employees cannot be used against them in criminal prosecutions if the employees made the statements after being told that they could be fired for not answering the questions put to them. The court also noted that, under state law, the employees were subject to automatic removal for refusing to answer the questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> principle has limited application in these proceedings, which are not criminal in nature. In <span class="Italic">Terry v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 543, 499 F.2d 695 (1974), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 421 U.S. 912, 95 S. Ct. 1567, 43 L. Ed.2d 777 (1975), a postal employee was removed based upon his admission to a Postal Inspector that he had converted agency funds to his own use. Terry contested his removal and argued, based on <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>, that the agency was not entitled to rely on his admission because he had made it out of fear that he would be removed if he did not answer the Postal Inspector's questions. 204 Ct. Cl. at 551. The court disagreed, noting that there were "no specific threats of a job loss for failing to speak" and, further, that the agency's regulations could not reasonably be interpreted as "requir[ing him] to give incriminating information to investigators." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 554.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Terry</span>, Boso did not threaten the appellant with removal for declining to answer his questions; indeed, as noted above, Boso testified that he told the appellant that he did not have to answer any questions. Boso also testified that he has no authority to take an adverse personnel action against an agency employee. Further, although the agency's regulations contemplate sanctions for an employee's refusal to cooperate with an official investigation, they cannot be read as requiring automatic removal (as the law at issue in <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> plainly did) if an employee declines to answer potentially incriminating questions posed by an agency investigator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also relies on <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Broderick</span>, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 20 L. Ed.2d 1082 (1968), and <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Association v. Commissioner of Sanitation</span>, 392 U.S. 280, 88 S. Ct. 1917, 20 L. Ed.2d 1089 (1968), for the proposition that a public employee may not be discharged for refusing to waive his Fifth Amendment rights. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Weston v. DHUD</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 948 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (a federal agency may discharge an employee for refusing to answer potentially incriminating questions if the employee is given adequate assurances that any answers given will not be used against him or her in criminal proceedings). The appellant was not discharged for refusing to answer questions, however, but as a consequence of the answers he did give. Thus, <span class="Italic">Gardner</span> and <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Association</span> are inapposite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. IRS</span>, No. A-89-CA-924 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 1992) (unpublished) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), which the appellant has appended to his petition for review, does not support the appellant's position. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the court enjoined the Internal Revenue Service from asking applicants for "public trust" positions, as well as current employees occupying such positions, about past or present illegal drug use. It held that requiring employees to choose between answering such questions and facing disciplinary action (including removal) violated their Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The court noted that the employees were given explicit guarantees that their answers would not be used against them in criminal proceedings unless requested by the Department of Justice in connection with an independent investigation. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> thus appears to conflict with <span class="Italic">Weston,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, by which we are bound....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> court's statement that in order to avoid a conflict with the Fifth Amendment, the questions put to a public employee must specifically and directly relate to the employee's official duties, supports our holding herein. The appellant performed electrical work on Air Force bomber aircraft, a position that required a clear head. Thus, it was not improper for the agency to question the appellant after it learned from others that he might be using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the agency was entitled to rely on the statement that the appellant gave to Boso in support of its decision to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's litigation strategy may have the effect of mooting constitutional objections if the appellant's misconduct is established by stipulation rather than through arguably improperly compelled testimony, <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 192, 203 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e need not reach the constitutional questions raised by the appellant because the record contains sufficient untainted evidence to support the charge regardless of any alleged constitutional violations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPB 334, 8 MSPR 686, 688-89 (1981). The appellant's counsel stipulated at the hearing that the appellant had engaged in the conduct on which the charge was based, despite his repeated objections to the earlier admission of the videocassette and his sworn statement. The appellant also testified that he has committed those acts. We find that the appellant's stipulation and his testimony fully support the agency's charge and are free of any taint of alleged constitutional violations. Therefore, we conclude that the appellant was not prejudiced by the admission of the videocassette and his sworn statement into evidence. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 8 MSPR at 688-89.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions mentioned earlier relate to interrogations. <span class="Italic">Connett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 322, 327 (1986), presented an unsuccessful challenge to a charge of falsification of a financial disclosure statement obtained during an agency investigation into an alleged conflict of interest:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contested the falsification charge on the ground that the agency improperly required him to complete the form, containing potentially incriminating questions on charges of conflict of interest, without warning appellant that he was under investigation for conflict of interest and while the possibility of bringing criminal charges against appellant remained....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1599"></span>A federal employee may assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination in an administrative investigation to protect against any disclosure that an individual reasonably believes could be used in his own criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weston v. DHUD</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 947-48 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The possibility of criminal action against appellant existed at the time the agency required him to complete the financial disclosure form. Since appellant was not in a custodial situation, however, the agency was not required to provide appellant with warning of his Fifth Amendment rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 732, 735 (1981) (Fifth Amendment "<span class="Italic">Miranda</span>" warning is required when an individual is subjected to a custodial interrogation).</p>
