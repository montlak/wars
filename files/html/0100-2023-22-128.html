<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-128"><span class="space">f.</span> EEO Complaint</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel fees may be awarded for work done on an EEO complaint at the agency level preceding a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 589, 592-93 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board has not excluded from a representing attorney's compensable time hours reasonably spent outside the Board proceeding but in furtherance of the same goal. When the Board has denied fees for hours spent outside a Board proceeding, it has depended on the fact that those hours were spent pursuing a claim unrelated to the merits of the agency action which is the subject of the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (fees denied to the appellant in pursuing his claim concerning the agency's promotion and early optional retirement decisions, which were completely separate from and unrelated to the merits of his removal appeal); <span class="Italic">King v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 20 MSPR 467 (1984) (fees for time spent in unemployment compensation hearing not compensable; since <span id="Page_4660"></span>this proceeding was in no way connected with or necessary to the successful prosecution of the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also awarded fees for time spent in connection with unsuccessful claims made on appeal. In <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at n.11, for example, the Board awarded fees for time spent on a reprisal claim as to which the appellant was unsuccessful. We believe such a result is in full accord with the rule stated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), a case in which the Court decided the proper relationship of the results obtained to an award of attorney fees. In <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Court held that fees were appropriately awarded for time spent on issues which arose from the same common core of facts where there was an interrelationship between the facts and the legal theories, and the plaintiff achieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without citing <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Board has exhibited similar thinking and has awarded fees for time spent on certain issues raised in an appellant's hearing on which he did not prevail. In <span class="Italic">Logan v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 23 MSPR 345 (1984), the Board held that only when the time spent is "non-productive," or when certain legal theories are deemed meritless and are truly "fractionable," should fees be denied for issues on which an appellant does not prevail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board therefore concludes that attorney fees are awardable for work done on an unsuccessful EEO complaint made before the agency, filed prior to a Board appeal, when (1) the complaint arose from the common core of facts which were the basis of the Board appeal, (2) the appellant prevailed on the appeal, and (3) attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. Of course, the fee award for the hours spent on the EEO complaint would be subject to the same scrutiny for duplication and excessiveness which all hours claimed receive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 135-36 (1987), a challenge to enforced leave, resolved as to a claim for fees that encompassed time invested by counsel in both a reply to a related proposed removal and in an EEO complaint proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here both the agency's proposed removal action, which was ultimately canceled, and the enforced leave action which was appealed had the same nucleus of operative fact, i.e., in both actions the agency contended, <span id="Page_4661"></span>and the appellant disputed, that the appellant could not perform satisfactorily in his position without an inordinate amount of supervision. Given the direct relationship between the bases of the two actions, we find that the services which appellant's counsel rendered in connection with the agency's proposed adverse action are compensable....&#8197;For the same reason, we also find that the time devoted to the appellant's unsuccessful handicap discrimination claim is compensable....&#8197;Both the appellant's discrimination claim and his rebuttal of the merits of the agency's action had the same legal and factual basis. In both instances the appellant alleged that he could perform his position with reasonable accommodation and that the agency's action of placing him on enforced leave was therefore improper. The fact that the appellant ultimately prevailed based on another legal theory is not a sufficient reason for reducing the fee award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were properly awarded for time incurred in the pursuit of an unsuccessful discrimination complaint that led to arbitration resulting in an award eventually appealed to the Board and resolved there in the appellant's favor on non-EEO grounds. The discrimination complaint arose from the common core of facts that were before the arbitrator and reviewed by the Board. The appellant withdrew her EEO complaint and presented those matters to the arbitrator as to her demotion. Although the arbitrator found that the agency did not engage in discrimination and the issue was not reached by the Board, the allegation was not frivolous. The discrimination allegations constituted an integral part of the appellant's request for Board review as well as an essential prerequisite for Board jurisdiction over the case. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 32 MSPR 683, 686-87 (1987). Fees may be awarded for time spent appealing a Board decision to EEOC. <span class="Italic">Bartel v. FAA</span>, 30 MSPR 451, 454 (1986) (appellant was successful with EEOC and obtained a remand to the Board). The Board considered the EEOC appeals process as an extension of the Board appellate procedures. Fees may not be awarded for time spent in EEO proceedings having no apparent relationship to a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Mannon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 503, 505 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 17, 25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24 (2003) (denying fees when a final agency decision determined that disability discrimination occurred but proceedings before the Board did not contribute to the finding of discrimination and resulted in no remedy for the appellant); <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 198, 207 &#x00B6; 14 (2000) (subtracting from a fee petition time spent on unemployment and EEO matters not related to success in appeal; on reviewing physician's reports and discussions with criminal defense counsel, when those matters were not related to the appeal; and on the unsuccessful petition for enforcement). For additional discussion of time allowed for pursuit of EEO proceedings, refer to <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 399, 408, 410, 412-13 (1989), awarding time for efforts in EEO complaint procedures (leading to compilation of an investigation report used in the Board appeal), allowing time for related efforts before OSC, and disallowing time spent filing a lawsuit in district court (having no demonstrable relationship to the Board appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were allowed for EEO proceedings before the Board appeal, but they were partially denied for work on the EEO components during the Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Sowa v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 408, 416-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the agency's argument, we find time spent on the appellant's EEO claims before she filed her Board appeal is compensable. An appellant need not necessarily prevail on a claim in order to recover attorney fees for work associated with that claim if certain requirements are satisfied. An appellant may be entitled to attorney fees for unsuccessful discrimination complaints made before the agency and filed before the Board appeal where the complaint arose from a common core of facts that were the basis of the Board appeal, the appellant prevailed on the appeal, and fees were otherwise warranted<span class="Italic">. See Robinson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 683, 687 (1987). The appellant has satisfied these criteria here. Her complaint that the agency improperly separated her during the staff adjustment arose from the common core of facts giving rise to her Board appeal, she prevailed before the Board, and fees are otherwise warranted. The administrative judge correctly found this time compensable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree, however, with the agency's assertion that the appellant should not receive any fees for pursuing her unsuccessful EEO claims during her Board appeal or in other fora after filing her Board appeal. Fees may be awarded for time spent on a separate and optional, but factually related proceeding, if the claimed portion of work done is reasonable and the work done in other proceedings, or some discrete portion thereof, significantly contributed to the success of the subsequent Board proceeding and eliminated need for work that otherwise would have been required<span class="Italic">. See McGovern v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 399, 408 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 604, 608 (1992) (unsuccessful discrimination claim inextricably interwoven with jurisdictional issue warranting conclusion that discrimination claim was based on same facts as jurisdictional issue and was not fractionable).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some circumstances, however, it is appropriate to reduce attorney fees for time spent on unsuccessful claims. Where an appellant fails to prove a claim that is distinct in all respects from the successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded from the attorney fee award<span class="Italic">. See Taylor v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 299, 304 (1996). For example, where an appellant makes multiple distinct requests for relief in a single Board appeal, each of which would form the basis of a separate Board appeal, the Board will reduce the claimed attorney fees to reflect the degree of success obtained if the appellant prevails on only some of the relief requests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 305. The denial of fees for unsuccessful claims depends on the finding that they are distinctly different from the successful claims because they rest on different facts and legal theories<span class="Italic">. See Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 101, 105 (1995). Fees may be reduced under these circumstances by identifying the hours associated with the unsuccessful claims or by simply reducing the award to account for the limited success<span class="Italic">. See Diehl v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 104, 111 (2001);<span class="Italic"> Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 612, 619 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These considerations apply to unsuccessful discrimination claims. Fees may be reduced for time spent on unsuccessful EEO matters where the appellant fails to show that the matters were related to the appellant's success in the appeal<span class="Italic">. See Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 14 (2000). Fees pertaining to a discrimination claim are also not compensable where the appellant advanced the discrimination claim in order to obtain compensatory damages but was unsuccessful in getting this relief<span class="Italic">. See Diehl</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. at 110-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these guidelines to the present case yields the conclusion that the appellant is not entitled to fees for time spent pursuing her EEO and discrimination claims before the Board or in other fora while her Board appeal was pending. The appellant's victory was completely unrelated to the facts and issues in her EEO and discrimination allegations. The appellant prevailed based upon a legal analysis concluding that the RIF regulations apply to the agency's health care professionals and that the agency's action was not in accordance with law because it failed to afford the appellant any of the RIF regulations' procedural protections. This legal issue and the limited facts necessary to adjudicate it are unrelated to the facts and issues surrounding the appellant's claims that the agency discriminated against her and retaliated against her for prior EEO activity<span class="Italic">. See Taylor</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 304; <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to resting on different facts and legal theories, the appellant's discrimination and reprisal claims were unrelated to her success in her Board appeal. Because the appellant's case hinged on the resolution of the <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> case, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice shortly after the appellant filed her appeal. After the Board decided <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span>, the administrative judge informed the appellant that she would prevail. The appellant's decision to continue adjudication of her discrimination and reprisal claims played no part in her victory and these claims were otherwise unsuccessful. Under these circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to attorney fees for time spent pursuing these unsuccessful claims before the Board or in other fora after filing her Board appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gensburg</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">cf. Morey</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 608 (unsuccessful discrimination claim inextricably interwoven with jurisdictional issue).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant does not automatically recover fees because he prevails on an EEO issue. The extent of recovery based on the Board appeal is considered, <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 17, 26-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-28 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he final decisions of both the Board and the EEOC have resulted in no relief for the appellant before the Board other than a declaration that the agency was bound by the finding of discrimination in its February 2000 FAD. The appellant has not been reinstated to his position or placed in any other position as a result of the Board proceedings. He has received no back pay as a result of his Board appeal. And, his claim for compensatory damages was denied by the Board. In addition, by the time Board proceedings had commenced, the agency had complied with the FAD and conducted a job search which revealed that the appellant could not have been accommodated during the relevant time period. Neither the Board nor the EEOC has found error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant could not have been accommodated. Thus, the only thing that allowed the appellant to "prove" his claim of disability discrimination before the Board was the February 2000 FAD, which preceded and was independent of the filing of the Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the Court in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> held that, even though a plaintiff is a "prevailing party" under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988, a federal district court must be guided by the degree of success when deciding whether to award attorney fees. 506 U.S. at 114-115, 113 S. Ct. at 574-75. The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> prevailed on the merits but received only one dollar as a nominal award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 108, 113 S. Ct. at 571. The district court awarded attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988 which, like 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k), provides that a court has the discretion to award fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 109, 113 S. Ct. at 571. The Court found that <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> prevailed in his claim, but, in view of the minimal success he achieved, the only appropriate and reasonable fee recovery was "no fee at all." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 115, 113 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Riverview Nursing Center,</span> 88 F.3d 1332 (4th Cir. 1996), the jury found that the plaintiff proved discrimination, but that he would <span id="Page_4662"></span>have been laid off from his job in any event. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1334. Based on the jury's decision, the district court issued a declaratory judgment in Mr. Sheppard's favor (essentially the result obtained by the appellant here). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The district court awarded $40,000 in attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit remanded for reconsideration of the fees' award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1333-34. In particular, the court was concerned with the question of the proportionality of the fees awarded in comparison to the limited relief obtained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court observed that "[w]hen assessing whether to grant fees, <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> requires that courts consider the relationship between the fees and the degree of the plaintiffs success." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1336, <span class="Italic">citing Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114-16, 113 S. Ct. at 574-76. Although the <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span> court applied 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), that statutory provision, like 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k), gives a court the discretion to deny or tailor a fee request depending on the degree of success and the amount of relief obtained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though we concur in the EEOC's finding that the appellant was a prevailing party, we conclude that the facts of this case present special circumstances weighing against an award of attorney fees incurred in proceedings before the Board. As discussed above, the record shows that (1) the discrimination issue was irrevocably decided prior to the commencement of any Board proceedings, (2) the agency changed its "blanket exclusionary policy" on accommodation before the start of any proceedings before the Board, (3) the agency fully complied with the FAD before the Board appeal was filed, and (4) the appellant received no relief from the Board other than its concurrence in EEOC's decision that the agency was estopped from denying discrimination liability based on its FAD. In sum, the appellant received no more relief for having brought a Board appeal than he had already received from the agency. Accordingly, based on the principles and guidance provided in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, we exercise our discretion and authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) to deny the appellant's motion for attorney fees for any work performed by his counsel before the Board. Under the circumstances of this case, any fees due to the appellant would be for work performed in his EEO complaint which resulted in the binding decision on his discrimination claim and the change in the agency's policy.</p>
