<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-63"><span class="space">6.</span> Causal Connection</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Two situations commonly arise in disability discrimination cases involving issues of causal connection. An individual commits misconduct, e.g., he is AWOL, and the issue is whether the conduct is caused by a disabling condition. The second situation is the individual who cannot perform a job, and the issue is whether the performance problem is the result of a disability. For the disability discrimination defense to prevail, there must be a connection between the disability and the reason for the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 21 MSPR 248, 254 n.3 (1984) (no connection between the sustained charge of notoriously disgraceful conduct involving a false claim and alcoholism); <span class="Italic">Kiernan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 38, 40-41 (1982) (AWOL/anatomical loss). The disabling condition must cause the charged misconduct. The causal connection analysis assumes nexus between the disabling condition and the adverse action. Nexus was established as to an alcoholic employee whose off-duty conduct, allegedly a product of the disabling condition, resulted in charges leading to his removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peru v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 52, 56 n.2 (1984). Causal connection is but a part of the equation. Assuming the connection, the focus shifts to whether the employer can reasonably accommodate the conduct or performance problem caused by the disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Scores of appeals falter for lack of proof of causal connection between a disability and the charged deficiency in performance or conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. GPO</span>, 86 MSPR 583, 587 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) ("[h]e has not alleged or shown that his failure to follow direct orders on four occasions to submit documentation regarding his absences was in any way related to his back injury or the medication he was taking for it."); <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 162, 16 &#x00B6; 78 (2000) (disability of a sleep disorder was discounted as the reason for tardiness when the appellant testified that he desired a shift change to meet his family care responsibilities); <span class="Italic">Momon v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 590, 591 (1992) (appellant having alleged on appeal that he was not under the influence of alcohol when he was arrested for DUI, incarcerated, and then removed for the resulting AWOL, appellant did not show a causal connection between the misconduct and an alleged disability); <span class="Italic">Hart v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 633, 635-36 (1988) (AWOL/alcohol and drug dependence; some absences were attributable to alcohol dependence, some were not); <span class="Italic">Ritter v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 334, 339 (1988) (AWOL/HIV infection); <span class="Italic">Corral v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 209, 211 (1987) (AWOL/alcohol: a pattern of Monday and Friday absences; referral by a supervisor to an EAP program); <span class="Italic">Aquiningoc v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 182, 183 n.* (1985) (no causal connection between drug abuse and the sale of drugs; the appellant was not so impaired by his condition that he could not form the intent to sell drugs); <span class="Italic">Finnegan v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 94, 96 (1984) (no evidence that drug addiction was the proximate cause of action taken for the participation in drug sales on agency premises); <span class="Italic">McBriarty v. USDA</span>, 12 MSPR 622, 625 (1982) (no evidence showing that problems of AWOL, failure to follow instructions, and insubordination, resulted from any physical inability to perform position duties); <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 239, 243 (1982) (no evidence that alcoholism caused absences).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a defense of disability offered in a misconduct case, appealed from an arbitration award, in <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 692-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 36-44, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007), the Board agreed that the appellant was disabled but disagreed with the appellant's contention that his disability affected his ability to work or other major life activity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the appellant's remaining disability discrimination claims. To prove an allegation of disability discrimination, an appellant generally must show that he is both a disabled person and a qualified disabled person. <span class="Italic">Bohannon</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Justice v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 21 (2001). A disabled person is one who has a "physical or mental impairment" that "substantially limits" one or more "major life activities," who has a record of such an impairment, or who is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Fraser v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 11 (2003). These terms must be interpreted strictly to create "a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled." <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Department of the Interior</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24 (2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</span>, 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002)). The phrase "substantially limits" precludes impairments that interfere with major life activities in only a minor way. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 23. The term "major life activities" refers to "'activities that are of central importance to daily life.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>, 534 U.S. at 197). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations define "major life activities" as "functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i); <span class="Italic">Fraser</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 12. A medical diagnosis of an impairment, by itself, is not sufficient to prove disability; an appellant must offer evidence "that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial, in terms of the employee's own experience." <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A qualified disabled individual is a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); <span class="Italic">Bohannon</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 552, 561 (1997). The agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation to the employee only arises when the employee has established his status as a qualified disabled employee. <span class="Italic">Bohannon</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record demonstrates that the appellant has been diagnosed with depression....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After receiving this medical documentation from the appellant, the agency had them reviewed by a psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas C. Goldman....&#8197;Dr. Goldman questioned the PTSD diagnosis, but concluded that the appellant suffers from "a long-standing serious personality disorder" and offered his opinion that the appellant could not be accommodated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence clearly substantiates the appellant's assertion that he has depression but, aside from his brief description of some of the side effects he suffered temporarily while he was attempting to find an appropriate medication, there is no evidence explaining how his depression substantially impaired a major life activity. The evidence does not show how the appellant's depression "substantially limits," as the Supreme Court has defined that term, his ability to care for himself, perform manual tasks, walk, see, hear, speak, learn, or work. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i); <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 25; <span class="Italic">Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 23. Further, the appellant offered no evidence regarding his own experience living with these conditions upon which we could conclude that his depression substantially limits a major life activity. <span class="Italic">See Burgess</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 25. The appellant does not argue in his request for review that his depression severely or significantly restricted him in the performance of any major life activity compared to the average person in the general population. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 8. To the extent that the appellant asserts that he is disabled due to the side effects of the various medications he took during portions of 2004, that purported disability can only be considered temporary or transitory because the appellant is now taking a different medication that does not cause such side effects. <span class="Italic">See Bond v. Department of Energy</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (1999); <span class="Italic">Crew</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 602. We conclude, therefore, that the appellant has not shown that he is "disabled" as that term is defined for purposes of a disability discrimination claim,[4] and there is, therefore, no basis for modifying or setting aside the arbitrator's decision on this basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3446"></span>[4]&#x2003;As to the appellant's argument that his medical condition and the side effects of the medications he was taking during the relevant time period caused his misconduct, we find that this claim is not viable given our finding that the appellant has not proven he is "disabled." <span class="Italic">See Ajanaku v. Department of Defense</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 350, 353 (1990) (to prove a claim of disability discrimination, an appellant must prove both that he has a disabling condition and that the charged misconduct was caused by the disabling condition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If causation is not obvious, to be probative the medical evidence pertaining to causation must be more than conclusory. It should be based on observations of the appellant's physical symptoms rather than on the appellant's self-reports, <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 245, 251-52 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish an affirmative defense of disability discrimination because of alcoholism, the appellant must not only prove that he suffers from an addiction, but that the addiction caused his misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Avant v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 467, 476 (1994). To make this showing, the appellant must present expert evidence as to the existence of alcohol dependency at the time of the misconduct. Expert opinions that are simply conclusory statements based on an appellant's self-reports rather than on observations of the appellant's physical symptoms are entitled to little weight. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 478 (physician's conclusory testimony regarding the appellant's drug and alcohol addiction during a period of time before he even met the appellant was entitled to little weight).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the appellant's positive drug test took place on April 12, 1993. The expert presented by the appellant to verify his addiction to alcoholism, Dr. Patrick Thrasher, did not even meet the appellant until September, 1993. He based his opinion of the appellant's alcohol use during the period of misconduct primarily on the appellant's self-reports. For this reason, his conclusory statements regarding the appellant's alcoholism are entitled to little weight. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the lack of expert evidence establishing the appellant's alcoholism at the time of his misconduct, the parties entered into a stipulation that the appellant "suffers from alcoholism." Even though this stipulation does not specifically state when the appellant was affected by alcoholism, we will assume, for purposes of this decision, that the appellant suffered from this disability during the time he engaged in the misconduct at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, Dr. Thrasher did not provide evidence showing that the appellant's alleged alcoholism prior to April 12, 1993, actually caused the appellant to ingest the cocaine that resulted in the positive drug test. The only evidence of the connection between the appellant's alcoholism and the positive drug test is the appellant's testimony that he went to a party where drugs were available and that he took some cocaine-laced pills after he had been drinking. We find that this evidence, standing alone, does not fulfill the appellant's burden to show that his use of cocaine was caused by or was entirely a manifestation of his alcoholism. <span class="Italic">Id.; Davis v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 203, 208 (1993). Because the appellant did not establish a causal connection between the alleged disability and his misconduct, the affirmative defense of discrimination must fail for this reason alone. <span class="Italic">Avant</span>, 60 MSPR at 481.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mercier v. DOJ,</span> 158 Fed. Appx. 264, 266-67 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), emphasized the need for expert evidence based on clinical findings rather than self-reporting as to an alcoholism defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A "handicapped person" is one who: (1) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g). To establish an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination because of drug or alcohol dependence, an employee must prove that he suffers from an addiction, and that the addiction caused his misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Kye v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 570, 573 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">King v. Erickson</span>, 89 F.3d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Toone v. Veterans Admin</span>., 38 M.S.P.R. 262, 264-65 (1988). The use of drugs or alcohol alone is insufficient to establish an addiction. <span class="Italic">Toone</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. at 265. In order to establish an addiction, a petitioner must present expert evidence showing a pattern of drug dependence that existed at the time of the misconduct at issue, which may include the following: (1) objective clinical findings, such as test results and observations of physical signs; (2) medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and (3) evaluation and assessment by a non-medical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See Avant v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 467, 478 (1994); <span class="Italic">Tierney v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 153, 156 (1990); <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Admin</span>., 37 M.S.P.R. 682, 685 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board did not specifically address Mercier's disability defense, that error, if there was error, was harmless since petitioner's claim was not supported by expert evidence. Apparently, the only expert evidence in the record is an "Evaluation Report" from Dr. G. Richard Kishur, based on "a comprehensive psychosexual evaluation" of Mercier. The report lists "Alcohol Abuse/Dependence" under the heading "Diagnostic Impressions," and states "[Mercier] presents himself as having a significant problem with alcohol abuse and has taken steps to address this problem." This report is insufficient. Expert opinions that are based on self-reports, rather than "clinical evaluations of observations of the appellant's physical symptoms," are given little weight. <span class="Italic">Avant</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 478. Moreover, the expert report does not conclude that petitioner's criminal conduct was the result of alcoholism. We conclude that Mercier submitted insufficient expert evidence to support a finding that he suffered from a drug dependence that caused his misconduct. Nor is the evidence sufficient to require imposition of a penalty other than removal.</p>

Medical restrictions precluded him from having any contact with asbestos fibers. <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 152 (1988).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marenus v.

USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 275, 282 (1995) ("The mere fact that the appellant has a medical impairment, even one of long duration, does not make him an individual with a disability because he has not alleged or shown that his impairment interferes with a major life activity."). <span class="Italic">Marenus</span> has been interpreted to hold that to demonstrate a causal connection between disability discrimination and adverse (or performance-based) action, the appellant must show that she was "not, in fact, reasonably accommodated or that some other accommodation would have been both reasonable and <span id="Page_3447"></span>would have allowed her to perform the essential duties of her position or another to which she could be assigned." <span class="Italic">Scillion v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board saw no causal connection between a mental disorder (manifested in an apparent inability to get along with supervisors) and acts of insubordinate and disorderly conduct, <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 128, 132-34 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the medical evidence establishes that appellant's personality disorder constituted a mental handicap within the meaning of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart G, we find that appellant has failed to demonstrate that her handicapping condition was causally related to the misconduct which led to her removal. It is axiomatic that if conduct for which removal is proposed is unrelated to an employee's handicapping condition, then such handicapping condition cannot constitute a valid defense to the legitimacy of the agency's adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Leazenby v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Service,</span> 8 MSPB 75, 78, 8 MSPR 384, 389 (1981); <span class="Italic">Powers v.

Dr. Sotsky testified that appellant was clearly upset about her relationship with her supervisor and that she felt a need and desire to move away from him. Dr. Sotsky further testified that appellant suffered from a personality disorder known as "avoidant personality" and, in general terms, described the characteristics which were limitations to an individual's functioning as a result of that impairment. Dr. Sotsky's testimony, however, with regard to avoidant personality was generalized and hypothetical. She failed to specifically relate appellant's misconduct to any characteristics of the disease.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From our survey of the record on appeal, including the transcript of the two-day hearing, we do not find supporting evidence sufficient to establish a causal connection between appellant's misconduct and any handicapping condition. Dr. Sotsky failed to present objective medical evidence relating to appellant's hospitalization or subsequent psychiatric treatment. Moreover, appellant failed to introduce into the record any documentary evidence relating to her hospitalization, psychological testing, or psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making her assessment of appellant's mental condition, Dr. Sotsky relied on the factual information supplied to her from the appellant. It was Dr. Sotsky's understanding, in talking with the appellant, that the appellant had no difficulty in maintaining a work relationship with anyone other than her supervisor, Mr. Burton. Dr. Sotsky acknowledged that she did not perform any independent fact-finding investigation and, in fact, failed to contact appellant's previous treating psychiatrist for medical information to assist her in her diagnosis and treatment of the appellant. Contrary to Dr. Sotsky's impressions, however, the agency demonstrated, and appellant did not dispute, that it willingly changed appellant's supervisors and geographically relocated her on a number of occasions, both before and after her hospitalization in April/May, 1982, in an attempt to alleviate the problems that were occurring with her other supervisors. The weight of Dr. Sotsky's medical conclusions, therefore, is significantly diminished because of her reliance upon unsupported and inaccurate facts supplied to her by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that appellant has failed to causally relate any handicapping condition which she may have had to the misconduct which led to her removal. Appellant has failed to establish any cause and effect relationship between the depression which led to her hospitalization in April/May, 1982 and her numerous acts of insubordination, misconduct and other unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Staten v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 206, 209 (1985) (existence of a mental disorder was not determinative of a disabling condition).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Alterra Blanding, the proposing official, and Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Gary W. Smith, the deciding official, both testified that, apart from the appellant's slow speech, they did not have any reason to believe that the appellant was actually disabled. Citing <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), the administrative judge found Ms. Blanding and Judge Smith to be credible witnesses in that their testimony was straightforward and consistent with earlier statements, they were calm and assured while testifying, and they did not exhibit any bias. The Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellant has failed in her petition for review to set forth any reason for overturning the administrative judge's determination that the testimony of Ms. Blanding and Judge Smith regarding whether they suspected that the appellant has a disability was credible, aside from baldly stating that the agency knew or should have known about her disability "merely based on her presence in the workplace." Moreover, the appellant has failed to suggest how or why the agency should have known that she is a disabled individual rather than simply an unacceptable performer. Accordingly, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to prove that the agency either knew or should have known about the appellant's disability.</p>
