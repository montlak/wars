<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-202"><span class="space">5.</span> Changes in Chain of Command</h4>
<p class="noindent">Akin to a reorganization is a substantial modification in the chain of command of an agency. The impact of a change in the command structure is assessed in accordance with the criteria historically applied to determine the appropriateness of units: community of interest, effective dealings, and efficiency of operations. A change in chain of command, by itself, will not cause an existing unit to become inappropriate. If a change in chain of command modifies the individual or organizational entity having authority to either set labor relations policy or to negotiate with the union, the change in chain of command could affect whether recognition of the proposed unit promotes effective dealings, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk, Va. and NAGE Local R4-1</span>, 56 FLRA 328, 332-34 (2000) ("<span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span>"):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;How Changes in Chain of Command Will Be Considered in Assessing Whether a Petitioned-for Unit Is Appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that, after the reorganization, the unit employees could not remain in a single unit because they began reporting to different commanding officers and directors, although all of those individual commanding officers and directors began reporting directly to COMNAVBASE. As such, the RD's analysis of the appropriateness of the Union's petitioned-for unit effectively made dispositive the fact that, after the reorganization, the unit employees were in three different immediate chains of command.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is Authority precedent supporting a finding that changes in chain of command may, by themselves, render an existing unit inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 46 FLRA 502 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Defense Mapping Agency); see also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Naval Avionics Center, Indianapolis, Indiana</span>, 11 FLRA 591 (1983) <span class="Italic">(Naval Avionics Center). </span>However, other Authority precedent indicates that a change in chain of command does not, by itself, render an existing unit inappropriate<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., USA Darcom Materiel Readiness Support Activity (MRSA), Lexington, Kentucky</span>, 1 FLRA 430 (1979) <span class="Italic">(USA Darcom). </span>Accordingly, it is necessary to address these apparently inconsistent lines of cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;A Change in Chain of Command, By Itself, Will Not Render an Existing Unit Inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several reasons support a conclusion that a modification to employees' chain of command should not, by itself, render an existing unit inappropriate. First, section 7112(a) of the Statute explicitly recognizes that a unit may be established on an agency-wide basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a) ("The Authority shall determine in each case whether...the appropriate unit should be established on an <span class="Italic">agency, </span>plant, installation, functional, or other basis...") (emphasis added). As agencies can have several layers of management and different chains of command, the fact that the Statute provides for the possibility of agency-wide units implies that employees who work for the same agency, but are in different chains of command, are not automatically precluded from constituting a single appropriate unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Authority has held that, in determining whether an existing unit remains appropriate after a reorganization, it will focus on the changes caused by the reorganization, <span class="Italic">see Morale, Welfare and Recreation</span> <span class="Italic">Directorate, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point,</span> <span class="Italic">North Carolina, </span>45 FLRA 281, 286 (1992), and assess whether those changes are sufficient to render a recognized unit inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See DLA Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1122-23. The Authority makes appropriate unit determinations on the basis of a variety of factors, without specifying the weight of any individual factors<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004, </span>47 FLRA 969, 972 (1993) <span class="Italic">(Local</span> <span class="Italic">2004). </span>It would be inconsistent with this practice to hold that changes in one factor, chain of command, renders inappropriate an existing unit, without assessing whether and how those changes have affected the variety of other factors that are considered in assessing each of the unit appropriateness criteria.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note that, under certain circumstances, a change in chain of command may affect the other factors that are considered in assessing unit appropriateness, and depending on the significance of those effects, may render an existing unit inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third...the Authority has held that there is a preference in the Statute for avoiding fragmentation of bargaining units when those units otherwise remain appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 55 FLRA at 361. <span class="Italic">Cf. Defense Supply Agency,</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Contract Administration Services Region</span> <span class="Italic">(DCASR), San Francisco California, Defense Contract</span> <span class="Italic">Administration Services District (DCASD), Salt Lake</span> <span class="Italic">City, Utah, </span>4 FLRC 669, 682 (1976) <span class="Italic">(DCASR) </span>(explaining that the three appropriate unit criteria developed in order to decrease unit fragmentation). Holding that a change in chain of command, by itself, can render an existing unit inappropriate, could result in existing units being fragmented due to changes that do not otherwise affect unit appropriateness. Such a holding would be inconsistent with this well-established principle.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a change in chain of command will not, by itself, be found to render an existing unit inappropriate. To the extent that the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 46 FLRA 502, and <span class="Italic">Naval Avionics Center</span>, 11 FLRA 591, imply that chain of command changes may, by themselves, render an existing unit inappropriate, we will no longer follow those decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Chain of Command Issues Are Properly Considered in Addressing Each of the Three Appropriate Unit Criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, in cases involving successorship claims following agency reorganizations, the Authority determines whether the changes brought about by the reorganization are sufficient to eliminate the appropriateness of the recognized unit. <span class="Italic">See DLA Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1122-23. In reaching that determination, the Authority considers whether the proposed unit meets all three of the appropriate unit criteria set forth in section 7112(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 959. The Authority has set forth a wide variety of factors to be considered with respect to each of the three criteria, but has not specified the weight of individual factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See Local 2004, </span>47 FLRA at 972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The community of interest criterion is intended to "ensure that it is possible for [employees] to deal collectively [with management] as a single group." <span class="Italic">FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 960 (citations omitted). The "effective dealings" criterion pertains to the relationship between management and the exclusive representative selected by the proposed unit. <span class="Italic">See FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961. The "efficiency of operations" criterion pertains to whether the structure of the bargaining unit bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although AFGE asserts that chain of command issues should not be considered in assessing the community of interest criterion, changes in chains of command may affect unit employees' ability to deal collectively with management as a single group. This is true particularly in situations where unit employees have been organizationally separated into different chains of command, with different management officials holding independent bargaining authority. As such, contrary to AFGE's assertion, and consistent with the OGC's arguments and Authority precedent, we hold that chain of command issues are appropriately considered in assessing whether unit employees share a community of interest. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 960-61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_214"></span>Consistent with our precedent, and the OGC's arguments, changes in chain of command may also be relevant in assessing the second and third appropriate unit criteria. In assessing the second criterion--whether recognition of a proposed unit would promote effective dealings--the Authority considers, among other things, the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical importance to employees in the proposed unit, and the level at which labor relations policy is set in the agency. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 961. To the extent that a change in chain of command also changes which individual or organizational entity has the authority to set labor relations policy and/or negotiate with the exclusive representative of the unit, the change in chain of command could affect whether recognition of the proposed unit would promote effective dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the third criterion--efficiency of agency operations--the Authority considers whether the structure of the bargaining unit bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 962. To the extent that a change in chain of command may also bring changes to the agency's operational and organizational structure, the change in chain of command could create a situation where the existing unit no longer bears a rational relationship to that structure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Consistent with the foregoing principles, we hold that</span>, in assessing unit appropriateness, it is proper to consider whether changes in chains of command have affected any or all of the three appropriate unit criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent">With some disagreement among the members, FLRA affirmed that a change in the chain of command through a reorganization and consolidation of management control of facilities with separate units of recognition (with different unions) does not itself serve to create a successorship issue, <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs, Little Rock District and IBEW, Local 2219</span>, 71 FLRA 451, 451-55 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring; Member Abbott concurring; Chairman Kiko dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that a petition for the creation of a more efficient bargaining unit does not necessitate the dismantling of a unit structure that remains otherwise appropriate within the meaning of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity/Petitioner--the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District--filed a petition with the Atlanta Regional Office to determine whether the 2014 and 2016 reorganizations that resulted in one McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS) made the two pre-existing bargaining units inappropriate under the successorship doctrine and whether the predominate unit should be certified as the exclusive representative of the two units without an election. In the attached decision and order, Federal Labor Relations Authority Regional Director Richard S. Jones (RD) found that the Petitioner is a successor employer of the two units and that each of the units remained appropriate despite the reorganizations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Petitioner filed an application for review of the RD's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The main question before us is whether the RD made a clear and prejudicial error of substantial fact when he determined that each bargaining unit remains "appropriate" following the reorganizations of the MKARNS. Because the record supports the RD's determination that each bargaining unit remains appropriate within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, we deny the application for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and RD's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A. <span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MKARNS is a river system managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to oversee the infrastructure of the Arkansas River. The Little Rock District (the District), which is a district in the Southwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, supervises portions of the MKARNS in Arkansas and Missouri. Prior to 2014, the District had two project offices that were divided into a northern and southern region based on the geography of the Arkansas River. Additionally, each project office was responsible for the management and supervision of the locks, dams, hydropower, navigation, and recreation on its respective portion of the Arkansas River. The parties also stipulated that the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2219 (IBEW) represents the bargaining unit in the northern region and that the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 953 (AFGE) represents the bargaining unit in the southern region.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2014, the Petitioner reorganized the District by downgrading the two project offices to site offices and by creating the MKARNS Project Office. The MKARNS Project Office is now solely responsible for the management and supervision of the District and the two site offices are now maintained by one manager. In 2017, the Petitioner orchestrated a second reorganization to make supervisory roles governed by function rather than geography. Therefore, the Petitioner moved navigation functions to the MKARNS Project Office and created two new navigation manager positions. However, the reorganizations did not change the job duties or work locations for employees in AFGE or IBEW in any meaningful way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner initiated the reorganizations to create more efficiency and effectiveness in the operation, budget, and management of the District and filed the petition in September 2018 seeking the determination of a single bargaining unit with the Petitioner being a successor employer to both units and by merging AFGE into "sufficiently predominate" IBEW.[4] The Petitioner claimed the reorganizations of the District eliminated the appropriateness of having two bargaining units divided by geographic location and, therefore, one unit would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1; <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM) Redstone Arsenal, Ala</span>., 56 FLRA 126, 131 (2000) ("The Authority has recognized that when more than one labor organization has represented employees in a new unit, one group may be 'sufficiently predominant' to render an election unnecessary.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both unions opposed the petition and argued that the reorganizations did not change the bargaining-unit employees' job duties, work locations, working conditions, or conditions of employment. Accordingly, both unions sought to remain the representatives of their respective bargaining units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties also stipulated to the following facts: that AFGE and IBEW each have active collective bargaining agreements (CBA) with the Petitioner, that the geographic boundary of the MKARNS had not changed for at least ten years, that no new mission had been added to the MKARNS as a result of the reorganizations, and that labor relations and human resources of the Petitioner had not been affected by the reorganizations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B. <span class="Italic">RD's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the RD applied the three-prong test prescribed in <span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, California</span> for resolving successorship claims.[5] Accordingly, he found that a majority of the bargaining-unit employees were transferred to the MKARNS Project Office. The RD next considered whether the two bargaining units, represented by AFGE and IBEW, remained appropriate units following the reorganization. Pursuant to &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, a unit is appropriate if (1) the employees in the unit share a community of interest; (2) the unit promotes effective dealings with the agency; and (3) the unit promotes the efficiency of agency operations.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;50 FLRA 363, 368 (1995) ("[The Authority] will find that a gaining entity is a successor, and a union retains its status as the exclusive representative of employees who are transferred to the successor, when:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;An entire recognized unit, or a portion thereof, is transferred and the transferred employees: (a) are in an appropriate bargaining unit, under section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, after the transfer; and (b) constitute a majority of the employees in such unit; (2) The gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity; and (3) It has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary to determine representation.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The RD determined that the two bargaining units remained appropriate because the unit employees shared a clear and identifiable community of interest with their respective unions, the reorganizations did not affect the effective dealings that the unions had with the Petitioner, and the Petitioner continued to have an efficiency of operations with the unions following the reorganizations. In reaching this conclusion, the RD found that the reorganizations of the MKARNS system was "simply a new system of management intended to manage the two site offices that were formerly more independent." Additionally, he noted that the bargaining-unit employees were not "transferred over to an entirely new activity from a distinctly-separate activity" and that the unions had longstanding, successful relationships with the Petitioner. The RD also noted that the reorganizations did not significantly change the bargaining-unit employees' job duties, work locations, working conditions, or conditions of employment. Therefore, the RD concluded that the Petitioner was a successor employer to AFGE and IBEW and that both unions remained appropriate.[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_215"></span>A. <span class="Italic">We decline to first consider the Petitioner's claim that one bargaining unit is appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute usually prefers to prevent unit fragmentation when an existing unit remains otherwise appropriate.[14] Consequently, where there are competing claims for appropriate units following a reorganization, the Authority first considers the claim that most fully preserves the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in terms of unit structure.[15] In its application for review, the Petitioner requests that we overrule the precedent set by <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Commander, Naval Base, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, (<span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span>) and, instead, first consider the Petitioner's claim because it promotes "effectiveness and efficiency."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">While efficiency and effectiveness are important concerns, we recently reiterated in a representation case involving severance that "preventing unit fragmentation is an important consideration, but employee interests, concerns, and self-determination are of equal importance...."[17] In the instant case, the RD took into consideration that the employees had already selected AFGE and IBEW as their representatives and there was no evidence of dissatisfaction with their choice, as inefficient as their choices may have been to the Petitioner. Consequently, we decline to overrule <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span> and we will not consider the Petitioner's appropriate unit claim because, as outlined below, the two existing bargaining units remain appropriate following the reorganizations.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">B. <span class="Italic">The RD did not commit clear and prejudicial errors concerning a substantial factual matter.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-3">1. <span class="Italic">Both unions continue to have a separate community of interest.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner argues that the RD "failed to consider the majority of the relevant facts in determining the appropriate unit for the agency employees." Therefore, it argues that the RD erred in finding that the two bargaining units, as represented by AFGE and IBEW, remain appropriate units following the reorganizations.[21] The record indicates that the reorganizations did not significantly change any of the transferred employees' job duties, or duty station. While bargaining-unit employees may sometimes travel to another location for work, the parties stipulated that the Petitioner's mission and labor relations personnel have not changed since the reorganization. Additionally, the reorganizations added more supervisors at each lock and dam, but, the unit employees still report to the same chain of command. Furthermore, the reorganizations of the MKARNS have not changed the unit employees' duty stations and, therefore, eliminated the pre-existing geographic divide between the two units.[28] While the Petitioner passionately reargues its case and highlights assorted factual findings that supported its original petition for one bargaining unit, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the RD erred in his decision. Despite arguments by the Petitioner that the RD ignored certain facts in evidence, the fact that no one factual finding has any particular weight does not necessarily mean that the RD erred in his determination.[30] Accordingly, the record supports the RD's findings and the Petitioner has failed to show that the RD erred in concluding that the reorganizations did not eliminate AFGE's and IBEW's separate community of interests.[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining whether the unit employees continue to share a community of interest with their respective unions, the Authority will consider factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">CHSC</span>, 61 FLRA at 869.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span>, 56 FLRA at 332 ("The Authority makes appropriate unit determinations on the basis of a variety of factors, without specifying the weight of any individual factors.").</p>

The Petitioner also cites to <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Fleet Readiness Ctr. Sw., San Diego, Cal</span>., 63 FLRA 245, 252 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Fleet Readiness</span>), to support its assertion that the units do not share a separate community of interest. Application at 7. However, the facts in <span class="Italic">Fleet Readiness</span> are distinguishable from the instant case. In <span class="Italic">Fleet Readiness</span>, one bargaining unit was "administratively and organizationally integrated" into the other bargaining unit. 63 FLRA at 251. There is no evidence from the record that employees of either bargaining unit were integrated into each other.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2. <span class="Italic">The current unit structure promotes effective dealings following the reorganizations.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner maintains that "the current bargaining unit structure does not promote effective dealings" and that the RD erred when he found that the Petitioner is able to achieve effective dealings with AFGE and IBEW following the reorganizations.[32] The Petitioner further argues that the RD erred by relying on the parties' stipulation that the Petitioner's human resources and labor relations personnel have not changed as a result of the reorganization.[33] However, this argument does not challenge the RD's factual findings and, therefore, does not demonstrate that the RD made clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.[34]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;Application at 9. In assessing the effective-dealings requirement, the Authority examines such factors as: the past collective-bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor-relations policy is set in the agency. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs, Directorate of Contracting Sw. Div., Fort Worth Dist., Fort Worth, Tex</span>., 67 FLRA 211, 214 (2014) (<span class="Italic">Fort Worth</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;Application at 9. The Petitioner also argues that the RD "misleadingly blamed" the Petitioner for failing to negotiate a "lock operator agreement" with AFGE. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the RD found that the Petitioner is able to have effective dealings with the unions based on a number of factors. RD's Decision at 10-11; <span class="Italic">see also COMNAVBASE</span>, 56 FLRA at 332-33. Also, the Petitioner does not challenge the fact that AFGE agreed to an identical agreement as IBEW. Application at 8-9. Consequently, the Petitioner has failed to show that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error of substantial fact. <span class="Italic">See Fort Worth</span>, 67 FLRA at 216.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fort Worth</span>, 67 FLRA at 215-16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regardless, the Authority has held that the continuity of a party's labor-relations personnel office is a factor in determining whether a unit(s) has effective dealings with an agency following a reorganization. Furthermore, the Petitioner does not challenge the RD's finding that the Petitioner's reorganizations were unimpeded by either AFGE or IBEW. While the Petitioner highlights two instances in which the parties failed to negotiate identical agreements, the record clearly establishes that the Petitioner has successfully negotiated very similar CBAs with both unions and that the parties have a largely successful bargaining history. Lastly, the record demonstrates that the reorganizations have not changed how agreements are negotiated between the parties. Thus, the Petitioner has failed to establish that the RD erred in finding that the current unit structure promotes effective dealings.[40]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Dist. Wash</span>., 60 FLRA 469, 474 (2004) (finding that an agency's history of effectively dealing with three separate units was not affected by a reorganization).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">3. <span class="Italic">The current unit structure promotes efficiency of operations following the reorganizations.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner argues that the RD erred by finding that the current unit structure promotes efficiency of operations because the Petitioner has to negotiate with two unions and, therefore, possibly agree to two different agreements,[41] but, it does not identify any factual errors that were committed by the RD.[42] Rather, the Petitioner challenges the weight that the RD ascribed to evidence and it is well-established that "disagreement over the weight that an RD has accorded certain evidence is not sufficient to find that an RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter."[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[41]&#x2003;Application at 11-12. The criterion of efficiency of agency operations concerns the benefits to be derived from a unit structure which bears some rational relationship to the operational and <span id="page_216"></span>organizational structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961. That is, a unit that bears a rational relationship to an agency's operational and organizational structure could result in economic savings and increased productivity to the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 961-62. Consequently, factors to be examined in assessing efficiency of agency operations pertain to the effect of the proposed unit on agency operations in terms of cost, productivity and use of resources. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 962 (citations omitted).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Petitioner maintains that the RD erred by concluding that the reorganizations were a "new system of management." Even though the Petitioner characterizes this conclusion as being an "erroneous over-simplification," it fails to establish that the RD's finding is not supported by the record. The record reflects that the reorganizations of the MKARNS largely affected the management system and did not reorganize the duty stations or job duties of unit employees. Additionally, the Petitioner's central argument is that the current unit structure is not the most efficient. However, the Authority has held that "the Statute requires only that a proposed unit be <span class="Italic">an appropriate unit</span>, not the most, or the only, appropriate unit."[49] Consequently, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the current unit structure does not promote efficiency of operations.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The reorganization affected the process by which the Petitioners issue and execute personnel and labor management relations policies.&#x2003;In this regard, prior to the reorganization, the Petitioners shared staff offices for their human resources, EEO, and labor-management programs, among others. Since the reorganization, the Petitioners have formed their own staff offices for such programs. Consequently, the Petitioners have begun issuing separate personnel policies that only apply to their respective organizations and they have also begun negotiating separate agreements with the Union. For example, the Petitioners negotiated separate agreements with the Union pertaining to the procedures by which each organization would exercise its authority to offer buyouts during fiscal year 2007. The JMC also worked independent of the ASC with the Union concerning issues with the JMC's recruitment process and staffing requirements. After the reorganization, the JMC and the Union chartered a Labor Management Partnership Council independent of the ASC, although the Union withdrew six months after its inception. The Petitioners have also separately notified the Union of their individual intentions to open negotiations to create new and separate collective bargaining agreements. Additionally, the Petitioners' managers and supervisors now contact their respective designated ombudsman when assistance is needed in dealing with an employee or the Union on labor relations matters, instead of going through the same ombudsman. The Petitioners also sought, and were granted, separate competitive areas for reduction-in-force (RIF) purposes. However, notwithstanding these structural changes, the Petitioners continue to receive "personnel servicing" from the same place (i.e., the Army's Rock Island Civilian Personnel Advisory Center (CPAC) and the North Central Civilian Personnel Operations Center).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the reorganization, the Petitioners' employees continue to share an integrated work space. A prospective relocation plan will place Petitioners' employees together sharing two floors of an office building, where 56 members of the ASC Acquisition Center will be co-located with the JMC Commodity Team so that the two teams can continue to work together. Although the work setting will be integrated and employees from both the Petitioners will be involved in collaborative projects, the employees will be governed by their respective organizations' policies and procedures.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a unit is appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, the Authority considers whether the unit would: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">See FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 959-62. A proposed unit must meet all three criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">Army, </span>60 FLRA at 394. Determinations as to each of these criteria are made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority has set out factors for assessing each criterion, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing the statutory criteria, we find, for the reasons that follow, that the RD's decision does not support a determination that the previous unit was rendered inappropriate by the reorganization. We also find that the RD failed to consider Authority precedent, set forth above, indicating a preference for preserving long standing bargaining units and avoiding unit fragmentation. Finally, the stipulation does not permit the Authority to make the determinations necessary to resolve the petition. Accordingly, the petition is remanded to the RD for further action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Community of Interest</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first appropriate unit criterion--whether employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--the Authority examines such factors as whether the employees in the proposed unit: are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960-61 (citations omitted). In addition, factors such as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation may be relevant. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 961. As set forth above, the fundamental premise of determining whether a community of interest exists among employees is to ensure that it is possible for employees to deal collectively with management as a single group.<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 960-61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that employees in the existing unit no longer share a community of interest, the RD found that, after the reorganization, affected employees were organizationally divided into distinct components with separate budgets, missions, chains of command, and competitive areas. However, as noted above, the Authority has held that a change in chain of command, by itself, does not render an existing unit inappropriate, but rather is considered in light of the three criteria set forth in &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Naval Base, Norfolk</span>, 56 FLRA at 332-33. Similarly, while ASC and JMC unit employees are subject to separate competitive areas for RIF purposes, the existence of separate competitive areas for such purposes, like any other factor in evaluating community of interest, is not dispositive in resolving that issue. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA 969, 972 (1993) (factors which employees did not have in common, such as RIF competitive area, do not undermine the RD's determination that a community of interest exists).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD noted, but did not weigh, the fact that the Petitioners' missions and budgets did not change after reorganization. <span class="Italic">See </span>Union's Application for Review<span class="Italic"> </span>at 10 (claiming that the Petitioners have always operated under separate missions and budgets); Petitioner's Opposition at 5 (acknowledging the Petitioners have separate missions and budgets but not responding to the Union's argument that this constitutes the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>); RD's Decision at 6 (finding that, as a result of the reorganization, the Petitioners have distinct components, budgets, missions, and chains of commands). Additionally, although the RD also considered how the reorganization changed the procedure by which labor relations and personnel policies are administered, he did not evaluate whether, in practice, this change affected Petitioners' employees. <span class="Italic">See Wright-Patterson, </span>55 FLRA at 363 (citing <span class="Italic">Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Tex.</span>, 5 FLRA 657, 661 (1981)) (Authority assessed whether employees work under similar labor and personnel <span id="page_217"></span>policies when evaluating whether such policies favor consolidation). Finally, although the RD noted the Union's argument that the Petitioners' employees shared work space and working conditions, he made no findings on these matters, finding only that they "do not outweigh the significant and extensive differences between the two groups."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the stipulation does not permit the Authority to resolve these issues. With regard to community of interest, the parties' stipulation provides that there was a reorganization, and that the Petitioners are now independent Major Subordinate Commands with separate missions and competitive areas. The stipulation also provides that, although the Petitioners still receive personnel servicing from the same entity (CPAC), as was the case prior to the reorganization, the ASC and JMC now issue separate personnel policies and staff offices. Additionally, the stipulation provides that the Petitioners' labor-management issues are now dealt with separately and that several of their staff offices have changed as a result of the reorganization. The stipulation also includes a list of job titles at the ASC and JMC and provides that Petitioners' employees will share work space after they relocate to new locations on Rock Island Arsenal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the stipulation omits facts concerning several significant factors. For example, with regard to personnel servicing and labor relations, the stipulation does not specify whether the Petitioners' ombudsmen operate independently of CPAC or are subordinate to CPAC. The stipulation does not provide any information concerning the relationship between the duties, job titles and working conditions of ASC and JMC employees or any information that would permit a determination of whether there are unique conditions of employment or other factors that indicate the employees no longer share a community of interest. Moreover, the stipulation does not provide a basis for resolving whether the policies which apply separately to the ASC and JMC are substantively different. Accordingly, as the stipulation does not provide sufficient information to decide whether the employees share a community of interest, the Authority is unable to determine whether employees in the existing unit continue to share a community of interest. As such, a remand to the RD is necessary to develop a sufficient record and specific factual findings in order to properly make a community of interest determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Effective Dealings</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The criterion of effective dealings pertains to the relationship between management and the exclusive representative selected by unit employees in an appropriate bargaining unit.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961. In assessing this requirement, the Authority examines such factors as: the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations policy is set in the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the record does not establish that the existing unit of Petitioners' employees promotes effective dealings, the RD found that, as a result of the reorganization, the Petitioners "have separate and independent bargaining authority and negotiators," and "separate and independent authority to establish their own personnel and labor relations policies." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Additionally, the RD determined that both entities "have conducted separate dealings and negotiations with the Union and such were not shown to be ineffective." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>However, the RD did not make any additional findings regarding any of the factors, set forth above, used to resolve the "effective dealings" question, including the parties' past collective bargaining experience.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with the community of interest factor, the stipulation does not permit us to resolve this matter. For example, the stipulation does not address the bargaining history of the parties. Further, although the stipulation identifies CPAC as administering personnel policies, and the ombudsman program as addressing labor relations issues, it does not explain the roles of these offices sufficiently to determine the extent to which the ombudsmen are independent of CPAC, or at what level personnel policies and labor relations decisions are made. As a result, the Authority is unable to determine whether the single unit continues to satisfy this criterion and a remand for further findings and consideration regarding this criterion is also warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Efficiency of Operations</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The criterion of efficiency of agency operations concerns the "benefits to be derived from a unit structure which bears some rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency." <span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961. That is, a unit that bears "some" rational relationship to an agency's operational and organizational structure could result in economic savings and increased productivity to the agency. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Consequently, factors to be examined in assessing efficiency of agency operations pertain to the effect of the proposed unit on agency operations in terms of cost, productivity and use of resources. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 961-62.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the record did not support a finding that the existing unit of the Petitioners' employees promotes efficiency of operations, the RD found only that "the ASC and JMC are wholly independent and separate organizations[,]" and that "[g]iven the operational and organizational separation between the ASC and JMC, the existing unit no longer bears a rational relationship to either organization." The RD did not give any consideration to cost, productivity, or resource issues as they relate to this criterion, or to the fact that the ASC and JMC continue to be subordinate to commands of the same entity, the AMC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once again, the stipulation does not provide sufficient detail to resolve this issue. Although the stipulation addresses how the reorganization changed the organizational structure of the ASC and JMC, it does not include information bearing on how an alternative unit structure would affect economic savings and productivity issues within the Agency. Accordingly, on this matter as well, the Authority is unable to determine whether the existing unit continues to satisfy this criteria and we remand the case to the RD in order to develop a sufficient record upon which to make specific factual findings in order to properly make an efficiency of operations determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, and as discussed above, the RD failed to take into account the Authority's reluctance to disturb long-standing, successful bargaining units, the significance of preserving the <span class="Italic">status quo,</span> and a preference for avoiding undue unit fragmentation. Moreover, the record does not provide sufficient detail to make necessary determinations as to unit appropriateness. Accordingly, we remand the case for further action consistent with the above findings.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand in <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command,</span> the regional director granted the clarification and split the existing unit into two separate units, one of ASC employees, the other of JMC employees, and FLRA declined to disturb that determination, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army AMC and AFGE Local 15</span>, 63 FLRA 394, 394-405 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The bargaining unit dates back thirty years to the 1970s, during which time the nonprofessional and professional units were separate and each was represented by a different labor organization. In May 2006, the nonprofessional and professional bargaining units were consolidated. Currently, the Union is the certified exclusive representative of the bargaining unit which is described as including "[a]ll professional and nonprofessional employees [within] the Headquarters, [AFSC], and Headquarters, [JMC], including temporary employees with appointments of 180 days or more, and third-year nonprofessional advanced interns." The unit excludes management officials, supervisors, "Wage Grade employees," non-professional employees with appointments of fewer than 180 days, and "employees described in 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7112(b)(2), (3), (4), (6) and (7)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October 2006, the AFSC and JMC underwent a substantial reorganization. The Army Field Support Command (AFSC) was renamed the ASC, and the JMC was removed from the command and control of the ASC, and established as a separate and independent organization. As such, since October 2006, the JMC and ASC have operated as separate and independent commands, each headed by a Commanding General who reports directly to the AMC. The JMC assumed the AFSC's mission as the single manager of conventional ammunition, while the ASC took on a new and expanded mission as "the single force provider for logistics."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The JMC is responsible for providing ammunition to all United States military services, other government agencies, and foreign countries. The JMC employs 20 military personnel, over 5800 civilians, and 5550 contractors. Of the 734 civilians working at JMC's Rock Island Headquarters, 615 are bargaining unit employees. The JMC nonprofessional unit employees occupy positions such as Ammunition Program Specialist, Ammunition Systems Management Specialist, Industrial Specialist, Logistics Management Specialist, Quality Assurance Specialist, Inventory Management Specialist, and Traffic Management Specialist. The JMC professional unit employees work in positions such as General Engineer, Health Physicist, and Operations Research Analyst. The predominant career program for JMC employees is ammunition management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ASC is responsible for a wide range of material from vehicles to tents to socks, and logistics support--such as transportation, fuel, water, and housing--for current and future combat operations, ongoing Army training cycles, and worldwide disaster and humanitarian relief missions. The ASC has brigades both in the United States and overseas and manages a network of more than 60 battalions and logistic support elements around the world. The ASC's workforce consists of 727 military personnel, 1488 civilians, and 77,760 contractors. Of the 796 civilians employed at ASC's Rock Island Headquarters, 501 are bargaining unit employees. The ASC nonprofessional unit employees are assigned to positions such as Contract Specialist, Logistics Management Specialist, Procurement Analyst, and Plans Analyst. The ASC professional unit employees work in positions such as Accountant, Attorney-Adviser, and General or Mechanical Engineer. The predominant career program for ASC employees is contracting and acquisition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the reorganization, the JMC was subordinate to the AFSC, and as <span id="page_218"></span>such, its employees were under the command and control of the AFSC. The RD found that, as a result of the reorganization, the ASC and JMC no longer shared the same command structure, as the ASC and JMC each developed their own chain of command for the day-to-day operation and management of its command and employees. In addition, according to the RD, prior to the reorganization, there was one mission and one budget. The RD found that, as a result of the reorganization, the ASC's mission expanded and its budget increased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also found that personnel policies have changed since the reorganization.&#x2003;Prior to the reorganization, the AFSC and JMC employees were subject to the same personnel policies, practices, and procedures that were issued and administered by the same human resources office. The RD found that after the reorganization, the ASC and JMC each established separate human resources, equal employment opportunity, information management, and public affairs offices.<span class="Italic"> </span>Further, the RD found that, although the ASC and JMC personnel policies and practices are similar since the reorganization, the ASC issued a number of personnel policies that only apply to ASC personnel, and the JMC issued particular procedures that did not apply to ASC employees. The RD also found that the JMC has issued its own policies and, as a subordinate command to the Joint Munitions and Lethality, Life Cycle Management Command, is subject to its policies, while the ASC is not. In addition, the RD found that each of the ASC and JMC human resources offices provides assistance and advice to their respective management staffs on classification, promotions, recruitment actions, and other personnel issues. The RD also found that, although the two Commands used to be included in the same area of consideration for job vacancies and reduction-in-force (RIF), they now have separate competitive areas for RIFs. The JMC offers different awards policies from the ASC and the two Commands have "different approaches" to their Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay (VSIP) programs. The Commands' leave policies are also administered differently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the RD, the ASC and JMC share "certain staff support offices" and signed a memorandum of agreement (matrix support agreement) specifying that the Commands would share staff support offices for purposes of efficiency and economy. These support offices include Acquisition, Finance and Accounting, Internal Review and Audit, Military Personnel, Small Business, Safety/RAD Waste, OCONUS Travel Clearance, BRAC Support, and Civilian Deployment Support. The above offices provide support jointly to both ASC and JMC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that, before the reorganization, labor relations were handled by a single human resources office, which reported through the Chief of Staff to the AFSC Commanding General. According to the RD, after the reorganization, the ASC and JMC each designated their own Ombudsman to handle labor relations matters with the Union, including day-to-day dealings with the Union, contract negotiations, grievances, "Union notification," conflict resolution, and the resolution of third-party disputes. However, the RD noted that "the parties" have also dealt with matters jointly that affect employees from both Commands.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rock Island Civilian Personnel Advisory Center (CPAC) provides onsite personnel advice and services for both the ASC and JMC and all of the Army and Department of Defense units "on the Arsenal."<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD found that CPAC provides staffing and classification services and processes personnel actions. According to the RD, although the CPAC has not been given the authority to handle labor relations matters for either the ASC or JMC, it provides technical advice and assistance as requested by the Ombudsmen, who handle the ASC and JMC's negotiations with the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the ASC and JMC employees work in the same building (Building 350) but, "[f]or the most part, [are] not working side-by-side in the same offices."<span class="Italic"> </span>The sixth floor houses the JMC commodities teams, which are responsible for developing the specifics of the ammunition to be purchased. Some ASC contract specialists and procurement contracting officers work with those teams. Contracts can only be negotiated by certified contracting officers and the JMC does not employ its own contracting personnel. Thus, the JMC relies upon the ASC contracting officers for the purchase of the ammunition. The RD noted that, although these ASC and JMC employees work alongside each other, "their duties and functions are not interchangeable." The RD also found that the ASC contract specialists and officers have moved from the ASC to the Army Contracting Command, which is a new major subordinate command of the AMC. In addition, the RD determined that there was no indication of significant employee interchange, finding that nine ASC employees have transferred from the ASC to the JMC, and three JMC employees have transferred from the JMC to the ASC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the RD, the ASC and JMC contended that the "current combined unit of ASC and JMC employees is no longer an appropriate unit following the reorganization" because "the JMC and ASC are two separate and independent organizations." In this regard, the ASC and JMC claimed that "[t]he employees are subject to separate and independent commands, separate missions, separate budgets and are subject to different personnel policies that are separately established and administered by separate commands." As such, the ASC and JMC argued that the employees no longer share a community of interest. In addition, the ASC and JMC contended that the existing unit does not "enhance effective dealings or efficient operations[,] as there is no longer a common locus, scope and authority on personnel and labor relations matters."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union maintained that the existing unit remains an appropriate unit because the employees continue to share a community of interest since they continue to perform the same work under the same working conditions.&#x2003;The Union argued that "splitting the existing unit into two separate [bargaining] units would result in unwarranted unit fragmentation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;RD's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether to grant the requests of the ASC and JMC for separate bargaining units, the RD relied on Authority precedent used to determine appropriate bargaining units after a reorganization. As such, the RD held that, under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, the Authority will determine a unit appropriate only if the determination will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency and; (3) promote efficiency of the operation of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8 <span class="Italic">(citing United States Dep't of the Navy, Fleet &#x0026; Indus. Supply Ctr., Norfolk, Va.,</span> 52 FLRA 950, 960-61 (1997) <span class="Italic">(FISC)).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the employees share a community of interest, the RD noted that the fundamental premise of determining whether a community of interest exists among employees is to ensure that it is possible for employees to deal collectively with management as a single group. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 9 <span class="Italic">(citing FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960-1). The RD further stated that, in determining whether a community of interest exists, the Authority looks at such factors as whether the employees in the proposed unit: are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same supervision and chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; have regular contact and interchange; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">Id. (citing United States Dep't of Agric., Office of the Chief Info. Officer, Info. Tech. Servs.,</span> 61 FLRA 879, 883 (2006)). The RD also noted that the Authority considers geographic proximity; unique conditions of employment; distinct local concerns; degree of interchange between other organizational components; and functional or operational separation. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command, Se. Jacksonville, Fla., </span>62 FLRA 480, 487 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the ASC and JMC employees no longer share a community of interest, the RD found that the reorganization "significantly altered the scope and character" of the combined unit because it "split a unified and integrated organization into two separate and independent commands that are operationally, organizationally and functionally distinct." In this regard, the RD found that "[e]ach organization has its own unique mission, function,...budget, [and] authority concerning personnel and labor relations matters."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD concluded that "[e]ach organization carries out its personnel and labor relations responsibilities through separate offices and representatives who operate independently of [CPAC]."<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD also found it relevant that the JMC and ASC employees do not "share common supervision." In addition, the RD held that "there is little interchange or transfers between the groups" and that the ASC and JMC employees' roles, functions, and career programs are "different and separate." The RD also found that the employees "continue to report to their separate and independent chains of command."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the RD found that the personnel and labor relations policies issued by the organizations are "very similar," he found that they had "meaningful differences in content and implementation."<span class="Italic"> </span>In this regard, the RD found relevant that the two Commands have separate RIF competitive areas, that each has "limited the area of consideration for vacancies to its own employees[,]" that they have different VSIP programs, and that the Commands' leave policies are administered differently. The RD also found it significant that, as separate and independent organizations, each organization makes its own determination with respect to its organizational structure; numbers, types and grades of employees; assignment of work; the technology, methods, and means of performing the work; and operating hours, hiring, promotion, employee leave, overtime, discipline, awards, performance standards, training and other matters affecting working conditions. Accordingly, the RD found that "the previous community of interest shared by the employees in the existing unit no longer exists."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining that the existing unit does not promote effective dealings, the RD considered such factors as: the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the personnel office responsible for administering the personnel policies <span id="page_219"></span>covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations policy is set in the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing<span class="Italic"> FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the parties' past collective bargaining experience, the RD found that the professional employees were included in a separate unit represented by NAGE, while the nonprofessional employees were in a separate unit represented by NFFE until 1995, when the Union was designated as the exclusive representative for the nonprofessional employees. According to the RD, the professional and nonprofessional employees were in separate units until the Union became the exclusive representative of the professional employees and the units were consolidated in May 2006. In this regard, the RD determined that the bargaining history for the combined professionals and nonprofessionals unit has been "brief." The RD also found relevant that "the employees who transferred to new entities have been treated as separate units." The RD determined that, since October 2006, "the parties have conducted separate dealings on labor relations matters and such dealings were successful." Citing National Labor Relations Board case law, the RD concluded that, "past bargaining history has less weight when, as here, there have been significant changes in the employer's operations and organization."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the locus and scope of authority of the personnel office responsible for administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit, the RD found that, since the reorganization, each Command has been separately and independently responsible for determining and administering its own personnel and labor relations policies.<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD also noted that the Ombudsmen are independent of CPAC. In addition, the RD found that the record did not establish any limitations on either Command with respect to their ability to negotiate over matters of critical concern to their unit employees. The RD found that the two Commands must negotiate with the Union as a single collective bargaining entity, which "promotes cumbersome dealings as it treats separate and independent organizations, each having the authority to determine its own labor relations and personnel policies and bargaining positions, as a single entity." The RD also found that "the current structure precludes the two separate organizations from pursuing their announced intention to each negotiate separate collective bargaining agreements with the Union." As such, the RD concluded that "[u]nder these circumstances, the existing combined unit no longer promotes effective dealings as required by...the Statute."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the current unit structure does not promote the efficiency of operations, the RD found that "[t]he current unit structure does not bear a rational relationship to the operations and organizational structure of the employing entities."<span class="Italic"> </span>In this regard, the RD determined that the current unit structure is based on a single employer which no longer exists. As such, the RD found that, now that there are two "separate and distinct organizations," a single unit does not "enhance efficient utilization of resources or operations."<span class="Italic"> </span>In this respect, the RD found it significant that each organization has its own budget, chain of command, separate and independent bargaining authority, and day-to-day management and operations.<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD also acknowledged that, since October 2006, "the parties have conducted separate dealings on labor relations and personnel matters and these separate dealings have been efficient." As such, the RD concluded that "the current combined unit structure does not promote the efficiency of operations as required by...the Statute."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to whether the ASC and JMC's proposed units are appropriate, the RD found that ASC and JMC employees each have a separate and distinct community of interest because:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[t]he employees in each proposed separate unit are part of the same organizational component; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are centrally established and administered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also determined that separate units would promote effective dealings and the efficiency of their respective operations because "the units are co-extensive with their respective activity's operational and organizational structure and both exist at the level where personnel and labor relations policies are established." The RD also concluded that two units would be appropriate because both the ASC and JMC have successfully conducted separate dealings and negotiations as individual entities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the RD found that the proposed separate units would not result in unnecessary unit fragmentation because "the organizations are each independently and separately responsible for the day-to-day operation of their commands and the determination and administration of personnel policies, practices and other matters affecting the working conditions of their employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the RD ordered that the Union be certified as the exclusive collective bargaining unit for separate ASC and JMC bargaining units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a unit is appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, the Authority considers whether the unit would: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">See FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 959-62. A proposed unit must meet all three criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Military Traffic Mgmt. Command, Alexandria, Va.,</span> 60 FLRA 390, 394 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> Determinations as to each of these criteria are made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority has set out factors for assessing each criterion, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth below, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter and/or failed to apply established law in applying the appropriate unit criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A. The RD Did Not Commit a Clear and Prejudicial Error Concerning a Substantial Factual Matter</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(3)(iii) of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority may grant an application for review when the application demonstrates that there is a genuine issue over whether the RD has committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, the Union contends that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because the RD found that the two Commands executed two different missions, even though, according to the Union, the ASC and JMC "and their predecessors always had distinct but related missions. The RD found that, after the reorganization[,] the JMC was established as "a separate and independent organization," and assumed the AFSC's mission to provide ammunition to all United States military services. In addition, after the reorganization, the ASC took on a much broader mission than it had executed prior to the reorganization, including "managing, cataloging, disposal, procurement, distribution, overhaul and determination of material requirements...[and] maintenance and material asset redistribution, contingency contracting for combat support services such as food and lodging, and training equipment missions." The ASC's mission is now so broad that one witness testified that its "mission changes on a monthly basis." The RD accordingly found that, since the reorganization, the ASC and JMC each have adopted their own "unique" missions. As such, the Union has not established that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because the RD found that the two Commands operate under separate budgets and, according to the Union, "[t]here have always been separate funding sources for [the] ASC and JMC. Even assuming that the Union correctly asserts that there have always been "separate funding sources" for the ASC and JMC, the RD properly found that the Commands' budgets have changed since the reorganization. Specifically, the RD found that the ASC's expanded mission caused its budget to "greatly increase."<span class="Italic"> </span>Since the reorganization, the ASC's budget has at least doubled, to $2.4 billion. Moreover, prior to the reorganization, the JMC's budget was dependent upon the AFSC's approval. However, now that the JMC has become a major subordinate command, it now has its own budget. Accordingly, the RD properly found that the two Commands operate under separate budgets, and since the reorganization, the monetary amount of those budgets and the way that the budgets are managed, have significantly changed. As such, the Union has not established that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union contends that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because, in determining that the ASC and JMC do not share the same command structure, the RD did not consider testimony evidencing the significant interchange between the organizations. The RD found that the ASC and JMC employees work in the same building but, "[f]or the most part, [are] not working side-by-side in the same offices. Although there are ASC contract specialists who work with the JMC commodities teams who are responsible for developing the specifics of the ammunition to be purchased, the RD noted that these contract specialists and officers "were assigned to the ASC's Acquisition Center...on October 1, 2008," and moved from the ASC to the Army Contracting Command, which is a new major subordinate command of the AMC. According to the Agency, most of those employees have now physically moved out of the building in which the JMC commodities teams are located. In addition, the RD found that, of all of the ASC and JMC employees, only nine ASC employees have transferred to the JMC and only three JMC employees have transferred to <span id="page_220"></span>the ASC. As such, the RD properly concluded that there was no indication of significant interchange between JMC and ASC employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also with regard to the RD's determination that the ASC and JMC do not share the same command structure, the Union contends that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because he did not consider the matrix support service agreement providing for shared services between the two Commands. The Union contends that this agreement demonstrates that the Commands are "not self-sufficient and are forced to share resources since neither was given sufficient funding to duplicate certain functions." The RD noted that the ASC and JMC share "certain staff support offices" and that the Commands signed a memorandum of agreement specifying that they would share staff support offices for purposes of efficiency and economy. None of the record evidence establishes that the matrix support agreement provides for a level of interchange that would warrant a change in the outcome of the case had the RD detailed the interchange involved in the agreement. Although the Union argues that the matrix support agreement demonstrates that the Commands are not self-sufficient, this is not a requirement in determining whether two units, rather than one, would be appropriate. In addition, although the Authority has set out factors for assessing each appropriate unit criteria, it has not specified the weight of the individual factors, and the interchange that may exist in relation to the matrix support agreement is just one factor.<span class="Italic"> Army, </span>60 FLRA at 394. As such, the Union has not established that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union claims that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because the RD erroneously found that the reorganization resulted in the designation of two Ombudsmen to handle labor relations matters. According to the Union, each Command employed one Ombudsman prior to the reorganization and the duties of those Ombudsmen did not change after the reorganization. To the contrary, the RD found that the Ombudsmen's roles did change after the reorganization. "Following the reorganization, the ASC and JMC each designated their own [Ombudsman] representative...for labor relations matters." The record demonstrates that, prior to the reorganization, the two Ombudsmen shared their responsibilities between the ASC and JMC so that they could evenly distribute their workloads. However, since the reorganization, the Ombudsmen no longer share their responsibilities and their duties do not overlap. In addition, the record reflects that, since the reorganization, the Ombudsmen's responsibilities have expanded "tremendously."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the RD found that, after the reorganization, the Ombudsmen's responsibilities expanded to include day-to-day dealings with the Union, contract negotiations, grievances, "Union notification," conflict resolution, and the resolution of third-party disputes. As such, the RD properly concluded that the reorganization "significantly changed how labor relations matters are handled and decided." Thus, the Union has not established that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because he failed to address "the significant involvement of the CPAC in personnel, labor relations and disciplinary matters. To the contrary, the RD found that, while CPAC provides onsite personnel advice and services and processes personnel actions for both the ASC and JMC and other Army and Department of Defense units, it has not been given the authority to handle labor relations matters for either the ASC or JMC. The RD also determined that CPAC provides technical advice and assistance as requested by the Ombudsmen. The record establishes that, although CPAC is involved in personnel, labor relations, and disciplinary matters, the involvement is only to the extent that the Ombudsmen determine is necessary. The Ombudsmen go to CPAC for technical advice and assistance, but all of the decision-making authority is retained by the Ombudsmen. Accordingly, the RD properly concluded that, after the reorganization, labor relations are no longer handled by a single human resources office but are handled individually by the ASC and JMC Ombudsmen. Thus, the Union has not established that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Union has not established that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter warranting a review of his decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD Did Not Fail to Apply Established Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an existing unit remains appropriate after a reorganization, the Authority focuses on the changes caused by the reorganization, <span class="Italic">see Morale, Welfare and Recreation Directorate, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, N.C.,</span> 45 FLRA 281, 286 (1992)<span class="Italic"> (Marine Corps Air Station),</span> and assesses whether those changes are sufficient to render a recognized unit inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See DLA, Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1122-23.

Reg'l Office, San Francisco, Cal.,</span> 15 FLRA 338, 341 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where there are claims alleging different appropriate units, the Authority will first consider the appropriate unit claim that will most fully preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in terms of unit structure and the relationship of employees to their chosen exclusive representative.<span class="Italic"> Naval Base, Norfolk, </span>56 FLRA at 332. This rule stems from the Authority's reluctance to disturb long standing bargaining units when bargaining in those units has been successful. <span class="Italic">DLA, Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1124. Further, the Authority has held that there is a preference in the Statute for preventing unit fragmentation when an existing unit otherwise remains appropriate. <span class="Italic">Naval Base, Norfolk, </span>56 FLRA at 333; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, </span>55 FLRA 359, 361 (1999); <span class="Italic">Library of Congress,</span> 16 FLRA 429, 431 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the RD failed to follow established law.&#x2003;In this regard, the Union initially claims that the RD did not properly consider Authority precedent expressing "reluctance to disturb long standing bargaining units when bargaining in those units has been successful." Application for Review at 5 <span class="Italic">(citing DLA, Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1124). With regard to bargaining history, the RD acknowledged that the unit dates back to the 1970s, during which time the nonprofessional and professional units were separate and each represented by different labor organizations. According to the RD, the professional and nonprofessional employees were in separate units until the Union became the exclusive representative of the professional employees and the units were consolidated in May 2006. As such, the RD determined that the bargaining history for the combined professionals and nonprofessionals unit has been "brief." Citing National Labor Relations Board case law, the RD concluded that, "past bargaining history has less weight when, as here, there have been significant changes in the employer's operations and organization."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Authority precedent expresses a reluctance to disturb longstanding bargaining units when bargaining in those units has been successful, here the RD found that the history of the bargaining unit including both professional and nonprofessional employees was relatively short. In addition, a unit's bargaining history is just one factor that the Authority considers when making appropriate unit determinations. Although the Authority has set out factors for assessing each appropriate unit criteria, it has not specified the weight of the individual factors. <span class="Italic">Army, </span>60 FLRA at 394. Here, the RD clearly considered the bargaining unit's history, but determined that its history was not of such strength and longevity to outweigh other factors favoring separate units. As such, the Union has not demonstrated that the RD failed to follow established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the RD failed to follow established law because he erred in his application of several of the community of interest factors in determining that the ASC and JMC employees no longer share a community of interest.&#x2003;Initially, in this regard, the Union argues that the RD applied the wrong criteria when finding a lack of community of interest between the ASC and JMC employees because "the duties of ASC and JMC employees are not 'interchangeable.'" According to the Union, the RD should have considered whether the employees' duties are related to each other and whether there is "employee interchange."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering whether ASC and JMC employees enjoy regular contact and interchange, the RD found that the ASC and JMC employees work in the same building, but that most of them do not work together. In addition, the RD found that the ASC and JMC employees that do work together perform duties that are related to each other but are not interchangeable. Although the RD acknowledged that ASC contract specialists and procurement officers work together with JMC employees on the JMC commodity teams located on the sixth floor of Building 350, he noted that these ASC contract specialists and officers have moved from the ASC to the Army Contracting Command, which is a new major subordinate command of the AMC. In addition, although the Union asserts that there is extensive interaction between ASC and JMC employees, the record does not support this assertion. With regard to interchange between the ASC and JMC employees, the RD found that only nine ASC employees have transferred to the JMC and three JMC employees transferred to the ASC. As such, the RD properly concluded that there was no indication of significant interchange between JMC and ASC employees and the Union has not demonstrated that the RD failed to follow established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union argues that the RD mistakenly found a lack of community of interest between the parties because, although the ASC and JMC chain of commands have changed, the two Commands maintain the same policies. According to the Union, none of the employees "had any changes to their working conditions, including to their immediate supervision, as a result of the reorganization."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering whether the employees are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office, the RD found that the ASC and JMC each have set up various offices designed to create and issue individualized personnel <span id="page_221"></span>policies. The RD further found that the ASC has issued "a number of personnel policies that apply only to ASC personnel." In addition, the RD found that the JMC has issued its own policies and, as a subordinate command to the Joint Munitions and Lethality, Life Cycle Management Command, is subject to its policies, while the ASC is not.<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD further found that the Commands have separate competitive areas for RIFs, different awards policies, different approaches to their VSIP programs, and administer leave differently. As such, while some of the ASC and JMC personnel policies may be similar, each organization has the authority to issue distinct personnel policies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the post-reorganization working conditions, many ASC and JMC employees are subject to similar general working conditions because they work in the same building. In determining whether an existing unit remains appropriate after a reorganization, the Authority focuses on the changes caused by the reorganization, <span class="Italic">see Marine Corps Air Station,</span> 45 FLRA at 286, and assesses whether those changes are sufficient to render a recognized unit inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See DLA, Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1122-23. Here, the RD determined and the record reflects that the changes caused by the reorganization "significantly altered the scope and character" of the combined unit. Specifically, the RD properly found that the ASC and JMC now have separate and distinct chains of commands and missions, drastically changed budgets, authority to administer their own personnel policies, and the authority to make independent labor relations decisions. The RD properly found that the totality of these circumstances outweighs the fact that the ASC and JMC employees still work in the same building. Consequently, the Union has failed to establish that review is warranted because there is a genuine issue over whether the RD failed to apply established law in his conclusion that the ASC and JMC employees no longer share a community of interest. As such, we find that the Union has not established that the RD failed to apply established law applying the appropriate unit factors and deny the application for review.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed a petition seeking to amend the Union's certification to reflect a change in the level of recognition within the Agency. Prior to the petition, the Union's certification noted the level of recognition within the Agency as the CNO. Since the Union's certification, the Agency created a new command level, now known as the CNIC, that lies immediately below the CNO. In the command structure of the Agency, the CNIC is the immediate superior of the subordinate, administrative commands, referred to as regions. The bargaining-unit employees all work within these regions. CNIC personnel have the authority to hire, fire, and discipline bargaining-unit members as well as to arbitrate grievances. The CNIC has its own labor-relations program that handles labor relations for CNIC employees, including all bargaining-unit employees whom the Union represents. Additionally, the CNIC negotiated, on behalf of the CNO, with the Union on the most recent collective-bargaining agreement between the parties. The parties stipulated that there has been no significant change in the Union's bargaining unit itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the ARD's decision is inconsistent with established law. Under amended Executive Order 11,491 (the executive order), the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (Assistant Secretary) addressed a petition similar to the one at issue here.[14] Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Fort McCoy, Sparta, Wisconsin</span> (<span class="Italic">Fort McCoy</span>), an activity sought to amend a bargaining-unit certification to change the name of the activity, where certain authority had been delegated below the activity level.[15] The exclusive representative objected to the petition on grounds similar to the Union's objections here.[16] The Assistant Secretary denied the petition, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]&#x2003;petition for amendment of certification is appropriate when parties seek to conform the recognition involved to the existing circumstances resulting from such nominal or technical changes as a change in the name of the exclusive representative or a change in the name or location of the agency or activity. In the instant case, the evidence establishes that the re[-]delegation of authority herein did not result in a change in the name of the [a]ctivity or its location, but merely indicated that the four [U.S. Army Reserve] Command Commanders are now authorized to administer the Civilian Management Personnel Program.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Army, Fort McCoy, Sparta, Wis</span>., 6 A/SLMR 184 (1976) (<span class="Italic">Fort McCoy</span>).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 186 (union claiming that "to grant the petitioned[-]for amendment would diminish its representative status by precluding it from consulting with higher-level officials...on matters affecting the unit employees," and that "in matters concerning grievances, [the union] would not have recourse to any agency authority at a level higher than" the commanders to whom authority had been delegated).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then, in an early Authority decision (also applying the executive order), the Authority stated that a petition to amend a certification "is an appropriate vehicle to conform a recognition to existing circumstances resulting from such nominal or technical changes as a change in the name of the exclusive representative or a change in the <span class="Italic">name or location</span> of the agency or activity."[18] The Authority also stated that a petition to amend a certification "<span class="Italic">cannot alter the bargaining relationship between parties</span>."[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Neither of those decisions has been revised or revoked.&#x2003;Consequently, they remain in full force and effect.[20] Further, the parties have not asked us to revisit them, and we see no basis for doing so here. In fact, in an early decision arising under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), the Authority implied (without expressly holding) that these principles continue to apply under the Statute.[21] Specifically, the Authority stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he...petition filed herein seeks only to bring the certification up to date, and to reflect the new name of the [a]ctivity. <span class="Italic">There is no evidence in the record to substantiate</span> [<span class="Italic">the union's</span>] <span class="Italic">contention that the name change would have the effect of lowering the level of recognition, or in any other manner change the relationship of the parties. Accordingly</span>, the Authority will order that the unit certification be amended to reflect the change in the name of the [a]ctivity.[22]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7135(b) (requiring that "decisions issued under" the executive order "remain in full force and effect until revised or revoked by the President, or unless superseded by specific provisions of [the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute)] or by regulations or decisions issued pursuant to [the Statute]").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Headquarters, 1947th Admin. Support Grp., U.S. Air Force, Wash., D.C</span>., 14 FLRA 220, 221 (1984).</p>

(citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Assistant Secretary's and the Authority's holdings discussed above are consistent with well-established, private-sector precedent.[23] And other lines of Authority precedent further demonstrate that--contrary to the ARD's finding--changing the level of recognition on a certification is not merely a nominal or technical change. Instead, it has legal implications. In this regard, "[b]oth the courts and the Authority have...limited the parties' mandatory bargaining obligation, holding that a party is only required to negotiate with the certified exclusive representative and agency, respectively."[24] Consequently, one party to a certified bargaining relationship may not force another to bargain below the level of recognition--such bargaining is a <span class="Italic">permissive</span> subject of bargaining.[25] Consistent with these principles, "an agency may not foreclose bargaining on an otherwise negotiable matter by delegating authority as to that matter only to an organizational level within the agency different from the organizational level of recognition."[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Granting the petition in this case would effectively allow the Agency to escape its statutory obligations to the Union, over the Union's objections, and without any argument or evidence that organizational changes have occurred to render the bargaining relationship inappropriate.[27] This is contrary to the established law discussed above.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, nothing in <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot</span>, cited by the ARD, is to the contrary. In that case, the only change at issue (as relevant here) was a change in the name of the activity.[28] The instant case does not involve a situation where CNO has changed its name to CNIC; it involves a situation where CNO is trying to change the <span class="Italic">level of recognition</span> to the CNIC, over the Union's objection. The established law set forth above demonstrates that this is inappropriate. Therefore, we find that the ARD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot</span>, 47 FLRA at 243.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent distinguishes <span class="Italic">Fort McCoy</span> on the ground that, here (unlike there), the parties' bargaining relationship changed before the Agency filed the petition. As evidence of this change, the dissent claims that CNIC--not CNO--negotiated the latest collective-bargaining agreement with the Union. But it is undisputed that CNIC negotiated that agreement "<span class="Italic">on behalf of</span> CNO"--in other words, as CNO's "duly authorized <span class="Italic">representative</span>[&#8197;]" during negotiations.[32] That did not change the bargaining relationship between the Union and CNO.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The dissent also suggests that the Authority should just defer to the ARD's decision. But, as established above, the ARD's decision failed to apply established law. And the dissent does not explain why we would defer to such a decision--particularly given that (as stated above) one of the express regulatory bases upon which we will grant review of a regional director's decision is where the regional director has "<span class="Italic">failed to apply established law</span>."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the ARD's decision, grant the Union's application for review, and dismiss the Agency's petition. Consequently, it is unnecessary to resolve the Union's additional arguments, as set forth in its application.</p>
