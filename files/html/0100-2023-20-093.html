<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amended 5 USC 1221(e)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if, <span class="Italic">after a finding that a protected disclosure was contributing factor</span>, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure. [Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The italicized portion of the statute was added by the 2012 legislation to avoid the use of bifurcated hearings by the Board in IRA cases. AJs would hear the agency's explanations for their actions and then listen to evidence from the appellant, often truncating the hearings by concluding that clear and convincing evidence supported the agency's action even if it could be determined that reprisal played some part in the action. Appellants believed that their discovery efforts and hearings were significantly undermined by the <span id="Page_3808"></span>failure of AJs to permit full and orderly evidentiary development.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, AT-1221-13-0239-B-1 (NP 12/9/2014), explained the significance of the 2012 legislation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that he made protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), she made alternative findings that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have suspended the appellant, even in the absence of his alleged protected disclosures. Congress, however, recently amended the procedures the Board must follow in adjudicating claims of whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Clarke v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 19 n.10 (2014). Specifically, Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2) to provide that corrective action cannot be ordered if, "<span class="Italic">after</span> a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor," the agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing the WPEA) (emphasis added). Under this amendment, the Board may not proceed to the clear and convincing evidence test unless it has first made a finding that the appellant established his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, because the administrative judge did not conclude that the appellant made a protected disclosure which was a contributing factor in a challenged personnel action, we find that the administrative judge erred in rendering alternative findings that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 19 (declining to reach whether the administrative judge's alternative findings were proper in the absence of evidence that the appellant made protected disclosures and exhausted those disclosures with OSC). Thus, to the extent that the administrative judge made alternative findings that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have suspended the appellant, even in the absence of his alleged protected disclosures, we VACATE this portion of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nothing in the WPEA, however, precludes the Board from considering, at the jurisdictional stage, whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to a personnel action, even in the absence of a finding that he made a nonfrivolous allegation that the disclosure was protected or that he engaged in protected activity. <span class="Italic">Medina v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> SF-1221-14-0700-W-1 (NP 3/26/2015); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Delosreyes v. GSA,</span> NY-1221-14-0379-W-1 n.2 (NP 5/5/2016) ("Once the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency took or threatened to take a personnel action against her, the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, and the administrative judge was not required to address whether the appellant engaged in protected activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shivaee v. Department of the Navy,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 383, 387-89 (1997 (dismissing an IRA appeal on the ground that an appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of a personnel action, without addressing whether he had a reasonable belief that the agency violated the law).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the bifurcated or attenuated hearing practices in IRA cases were on their way out by the time the WPEA was enacted, it was previously determined that the Board "may assume for purposes of argument that it has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal in order to reject a whistleblower reprisal claim on its merits." <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dept. of Army</span>, 81 MSPR 225, 228-29 &#x00B6; 18 (1999). In <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span>, the Board assumed jurisdiction and then determined that the appellant's case failed because the agency met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the same action would have been taken without the appellant's protected disclosures. The Federal Circuit, whose jurisdiction depends on the existence of Board jurisdiction, was not much taken with the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span>, and reversed the Board. A proper jurisdictional analysis is required. The court concluded in <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20001551219f3d133211396">219 F.3d 1332</a>, 1336-37 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not consider whether it had jurisdiction over Mr. Schmittling's IRA appeal. Rather, it simply "assume[d] for purposes of argument that it [had] jurisdiction over [Mr. Schmittling's] IRA appeal in order to reject [his] whistleblower reprisal claim on its merits." <span class="Italic">Schmittling II</span>, 81 MSPR at 228. With this assumption, the Board dismissed Mr. Schmittling's IRA appeal because the Agency had "met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 229. In concluding that it could assume jurisdiction, the Board cited <span class="Italic">Niswonger v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 665 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">superseded by statute on other grounds</span> by 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)(A), (B)). <span class="Italic">See Schmittling II</span>, 81 MSPR at 228. We believe that the Board erred in its approach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, we allowed the Board to assume the first jurisdictional requirement--whether the employee's disclosure was protected--if the Board found that the petitioner was unable to prove the second jurisdictional requirement--that the agency took or failed to take a personnel action because of the protected disclosure<span class="Italic">. See Clark</span>, 997 F.2d at 1470-71. We held that it was not error for the Board to skip the first inquiry because, since the Board concluded that Clark's IRA appeal failed to meet the second jurisdictional requirement, addressing the first requirement would be both unnecessary and possibly wasteful. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the Board in this case assumed Mr. Schmittling's IRA appeal met <span class="Italic">all</span> of the jurisdictional requirements. The Board then proceeded to address the merits of the appeal, determining whether the Agency had proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same prohibited personnel action in the absence of Mr. Schmittling's protected disclosure--a defense to an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Schmittling II</span>, 81 MSPR at 229 (citing 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2)). Therefore, unlike <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Board completely bypassed the question of its jurisdiction over Mr. Schmittling's appeal. This was done in the face of the Agency's opposition to the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Schmittling II</span>, 81 MSPR at 228. Our holding in <span class="Italic">Clark</span> supports the proposition that the Board may assume certain jurisdictional requirements are met if it ultimately concludes that at least one element is not met. However, <span class="Italic">Clark</span> does not stand for the proposition that the Board may assume all jurisdictional elements are met in order to consider an IRA appeal on the merits. In cases such as <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, determining whether each jurisdictional element is met is "unnecessary, and probably wasteful." <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 997 F.2d at 1470. However, before addressing the merits of an IRA appeal, the Board first must determine whether all its jurisdictional requirements have been met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If it lacks jurisdiction, the Board is without authority to decide the issues presented by a petitioner. "The [Board] has only the jurisdiction conferred on it by Congress." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. United States</span>, 709 F.2d 48, 49 (Fed. Cir. 1983). This jurisdiction, provided by statute, creates "the power of the [Board] to hear and decide a case," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the Board's "subject matter jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Without jurisdiction, the Board's decision on the merits of a petition is a nullity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1217 (Fed.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 F.3d 961, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Moreover, in a case such as this, brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, "the scope of the subject matter jurisdiction of this court is identical to the scope of the jurisdiction of the [B]oard." <span class="Italic">Rosano v.

Thus, without jurisdiction, neither the Board nor this court is empowered to decide the merits of a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board improperly assumed it had jurisdiction over Mr. Schmittling's IRA appeal. The Board should have addressed the matter of its jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of the appeal. Accordingly, the decision of the Board denying Mr. Schmittling's appeal is vacated. The case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 454, 457-58 &#x00B6; 5 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Schmittling</span> determined that the Board "erred in assuming for purpose of argument that all of the jurisdictional requirements in an IRA appeal had been met in order to reject an appellant's whistleblower reprisal claim on its merits."), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOD</span>, 95 MSPR 192 (2003) (dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mentioning <span class="Italic">Schmittling,</span> the Board seemed to question an inverted analysis in <span class="Italic">Mason v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 135, 139 n.3, 2011 MSPB 39 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's entitlement to corrective action under the WPA concerns the merits of his IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 18 (2010). The Board may only address the merits after it has found jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Schmittling v. Department of the Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Thus, the administrative judge's determination that the appellant failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal is at odds with her denial of corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span> approach was implicitly endorsed in a decision that if jurisdiction was clearly established by the facts, the Federal Circuit would not remand simply to obtain the IRA jurisdictional finding omitted by the Board, <span class="Italic">Yunus v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20011609242f3d136711455">242 F.3d 1367</a>, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board did not reach the issue of whether Dr. Yunus had made any protected disclosures. Instead, the Board determined, as in <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span>, that Dr. Yunus was not entitled to relief on the merits because the agency had established by clear and convincing evidence that he would have been discharged even absent any protected disclosures on his part. The procedural posture of this case is therefore similar to that in <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span>. We do not believe that <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span> requires us to remand this case for the Board to decide the jurisdictional issue, however, because we do not interpret <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span> to require us to remand a case to the Board whenever the Board bypasses the question of its jurisdiction in order to decide the case on a nonjurisdictional ground. Where it is clear to us that the Board has jurisdiction over a case, it would be pointless to <span id="Page_3809"></span>remand the case to the Board for the Board to make its own jurisdictional determination. The error that this court identified in <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span>--the Board's conclusion that it could decide a case on the merits even if it lacked jurisdiction--is not presented in a case in which it is clear that the Board has jurisdiction, even if the Board did not address the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Briley v. Nat'l Archives &#x0026; Records Admin.</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has held that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the OSC and makes "non-frivolous allegations" that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). <span class="Italic">See Briley</span>, 236 F.3d at 1378; <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 234 F.3d 9, 12 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span>, 219 F.3d at 1336; <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see generally Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 686-89 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Yunus plainly satisfied these jurisdictional requirements. His discharge was clearly a "personnel action" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), and it was undisputed that he exhausted his remedies before the OSC. As to the remaining element, Dr. Yunus alleged that he made a disclosure of information that he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation, as required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), which was a contributing factor in his discharge. His claim was therefore facially sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements. Moreover, his factual allegations as to the jurisdictional requirements were not frivolous; indeed, the administrative judge found that Dr. Yunus met his burden of showing that his disclosures were protected and were a contributing factor in the decision to discharge him. Under these circumstances, because it is clear that the Board had jurisdiction over Dr. Yunus's appeal, <span class="Italic">Schmittling</span> does not require us to remand the case to the Board for it to consider the jurisdictional question. We therefore conclude that the Board did not commit legal error in deciding the case based on the DVA's affirmative defense rather than first deciding whether Dr. Yunus had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that his disclosures were protected under the WPA.</p>

Cir. 2006)), resolved that once the appellant established IRA jurisdiction through sufficient allegations, the Board could, during its hearing, bifurcate the merits issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Thus, for example, in cases arising under the WPA where the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations that he was terminated in retaliation for making protected disclosures, an administrative judge could properly hold an initial hearing limited to the question of whether the employee would have been properly terminated absent the disclosures, such as where the employee's attendance record was clearly unsatisfactory. If after such a limited merits hearing the Board concluded that the employee would have been properly terminated absent the protected disclosures, the employee's claim could be rejected on the merits, subject to the right of appeal to the full Board and to this court. This authority is akin to that granted district court judges by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(c)(4), which allows district court judges to govern the order of proof presented at trial, and to allow separate trials of particular issues....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Whatever the justification for inversion of the order of proof in a whistleblower case, it could be impractical because it was necessary to determine the state of knowledge of management officials of the appellant's whistleblowing and their motivation to retaliate--determinations that could not be made by analyzing the strength of the agency's reasons for an action, <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 117 MSPR 362, 370 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2012 MSPB 15 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the WPA does not mandate any particular sequence for trying the elements of a whistleblower case, in appropriate cases, the Board has historically first addressed the agency's affirmative defense and then, if necessary, turned to the question of whether the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> whistleblower claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Azbill v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 16 (2007).

Cir. 2010) (stating in <span class="Italic">dicta</span> that, "in a hearing on the merits," the Board should make findings on whether (1) the acting official had authority concerning the personnel action; (2) the employee made a protected disclosure; (3) the acting official used his authority against the employee; (4) the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action; and (5) the agency would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected disclosure; and that "[I]f the Board finds one of those contested issues dispositive, it should nevertheless resolve the remaining issues to expedite resolution of a case on appeal"). In the present case, the administrative judge found that the agency had proven its affirmative defense by clear and convincing evidence and therefore did not reach the question of whether the appellant proved his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under certain circumstances, however, the Board has found that full and fair consideration of an appellant's claims requires adjudication of both the merits of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as well as the agency's affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCarthy v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-32 (2011). In <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, the Board held that "the circumstantial evidence bearing on retaliatory motive includes the substance of the appellant's allegedly protected activity as well as the extent to which the deciding official was aware of it. Thus, resolution of both the merits of the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency's affirmative defense is required." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 32. We find that the same is true in the present case. We cannot properly assess the existence and extent of any retaliatory motive in this appeal without considering the nature of the appellant's disclosures and the extent to which the management officials responsible for the challenged personnel actions were aware of those disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1363-77 (Fed. Cir. 2012), emphasized the importance of motivational analysis in a case of some factual complexity. Readers should review the facts, but of significance here is the legal analysis that discouraged truncated factual examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The AJ's Exclusion of Witnesses From the Hearing</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ strictly limited the number of witnesses permitted to testify at Whitmore's hearing. Of Whitmore's twelve requested witnesses, the AJ only approved three: Whitmore, Mark Kitzmiller, and Kie'arra Pretlow. For the DOL, the AJ approved Shalhoub, Witt, and Dubois. The AJ's rationale was that other than Whitmore and the proposing and deciding officials, only those such as Kitzmiller who had actually witnessed the July 10 incident could offer sufficiently pertinent testimony. The AJ thus treated the hearing as if it only functioned to examine the proof of the charges and the reasonableness of the penalty--not Whitmore's whistleblower defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among Whitmore's nine excluded witnesses were David Morgan and the witnesses interviewed during Morgan's investigation. These witnesses were offered to show bias on the part of Morgan and OSHA officials against Whitmore, as well as proof that the stated reasons for Whitmore's removal were a mere pretext for his being removed due to his whistleblowing disclosures. The AJ excluded these witnesses because she believed they "are not material to the central issue in this matter, but rather have only peripheral relevance...." Several of those witnesses interviewed by Morgan were also offered to testify as to Whitmore's integrity, leadership, and commitment to OSHA's mission, as well as the alleged harassment of Whitmore by Dubois and others creating a hostile work environment to provoke Whitmore.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another witness offer by Whitmore named Eleanor Lauderdale was a non-OSHA DOL employee offered to testify regarding a DOL manager whose act of physical assault resulted in no discipline (and in fact the manager was later promoted). The AJ excluded her testimony because Whitmore failed to timely provide the AJ with a detailed summary of Ms. Lauderdale's testimony, as the AJ had requested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also precluded by the AJ was the testimony of Dr. Adam Finkel, another OSHA whistleblower investigated by David Morgan and removed from his position, regarding bias at OSHA against whistleblowers. A declaration signed by Finkel attests to various matters about which he would have testified at the hearing if given the opportunity. Finkel declared that certain OSHA officials had in the past made threats of violence to coworkers such as "[I]f you ever say that again, I'll squeeze your head like a grape until it explodes," "I'm going to tear you limb from limb," and "I'm going to kill you," but that "none was ever taken seriously, and no discipline or other action resulted from them." Finkel chalked all of this up to being "products of the stress and tension that permeated the Agency," and commented that "[t]he senior leadership at OSHA clearly regards such statements as unremarkable, even funny, when they are made by favored colleagues." Finkel also recounted an instance where an employee slammed a door so hard in Finkel's office that the hinges popped off and had to be replaced, but Finkel never reported the incident since he believed that no action would be taken against her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ thus admitted only testimony as to the affirmative charges brought against Whitmore, and excluded witnesses offered to support Whitmore's affirmative whistleblowing defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3810"></span>As explained in detail below, in this case the AJ unduly focused both the hearing and her decision on the DOL's affirmative case for removal of Whitmore, to the exclusion of Whitmore's whistleblower defense. Because we conclude that the MSPB abused its discretion regarding evidentiary matters, and failed to adjudicate Whitmore's whistleblower defense in accordance with the law, we vacate and remand for further proceedings in accordance with the following discussion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background Law</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 prohibits retaliation for whistleblowing, and provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not...take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;any disclosure to the Special Counsel, or to the Inspector General of an agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures, of information which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Analysis of a whistleblower defense takes place within a burden shifting scheme, wherein the agency must first prove its case for removal by a preponderance of the evidence, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56, then the former employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she made a protected disclosure under &#x00A7; 1202(b)(8) that was a contributing factor to the employee's termination. If the employee establishes this <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for whistleblowing, the burden of persuasion shifts to the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken "the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The "Clear and Convincing" Evidence Standard</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has explained that "[t]he purpose of a standard of proof is to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication." <span class="Italic">California ex rel. Cooper v. Mitchell Bros. Santa Ana Theater,</span> 454 U.S. 90, 92-93 (1981) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The "clear and convincing standard" is understood to be "reserved to protect particularly important interests in a limited number of civil cases." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 93. When enacting the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Congress explained its reasoning for requiring clear and convincing evidence as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"Clear and convincing evidence" is a high burden of proof for the Government to bear. It is intended as such for two reasons. First, this burden of proof comes into play only if the employee has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the action--in other words, that the agency action was "tainted." Second, this heightened burden of proof required of the agency also recognizes that when it comes to proving the basis for an agency's decision, the agency controls most of the cards--the drafting of the documents supporting the decision, the testimony of witnesses who participated in the decision, and the records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases. In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that the agency bear a heavy burden to justify its actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">135 Cong. Rec. H747-48 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (explanatory statement on Senate Amendment to S. 20). Against this backdrop, there is no doubt that Congress considered it very important that federal agencies be required to clearly and convincingly rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of whistleblower retaliation, especially given the evidentiary disadvantages that face removed whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether evidence is sufficiently clear and convincing to carry this burden of proof cannot be evaluated by looking only at the evidence that supports the conclusion reached. Evidence only clearly and convincingly supports a conclusion when it does so in the aggregate considering all the pertinent evidence in the record, and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Li Second Family L.P. v. Toshiba Corp.,</span> 231 F.3d 1373, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("When determining whether [deceptive] intent has been shown by clear and convincing evidence, a court must weigh all evidence, including evidence of good faith."); <span class="Italic">Price v. Symsek,</span> 988 F.2d 1187, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (vacating and remanding because the Board failed to consider certain testimony, explaining that under the clear and convincing evidence standard<span class="Italic"> "all</span> of the evidence put forth by Price, including any of his <span class="Italic">corroborated</span> testimony, must be considered as a whole, not individually, in determining whether Price conceived the invention of the count before Symsek") (emphasis in original). It is error for the MSPB to not evaluate all the pertinent evidence in determining whether an element of a claim or defense has been proven adequately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act makes clear that whistleblowing provides an important public benefit that must be encouraged when necessary by taking away fear of retaliation. <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("The purpose of the Whistleblower Protection Act is to encourage disclosure of wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to act to remedy it, either directly by management authority, or indirectly as in disclosure to the press."). Yet Congress understood that whistleblowers are at an evidentiary disadvantage in proving their cases. In many instances, our review of whistleblower appeals turns on whether substantial evidence exists to support the judgment of the MSPB. However, we are unable to make such determinations if the MSPB fails to provide an in depth review and full discussion of the facts to explain its reasoning. Such a complete evaluation of the facts is necessary in every case because outside of written opinions and transcribed oral statements, we have no basis to discern the reasoning of the MSPB and decide whether there exists "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Massa v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 815 F.2d 69, 72 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). If considerable countervailing evidence is manifestly ignored or disregarded in finding a matter clearly and convincingly proven, the decision must be vacated and remanded for further consideration where all the pertinent evidence is weighed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, "[p]rocedural matters relative to discovery and evidentiary issues fall within the sound discretion of the board and its officials." <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988). "If an abuse of discretion did occur with respect to the discovery and evidentiary rulings, in order for petitioner to prevail...he must prove that the error caused substantial harm or prejudice to his rights which could have affected the outcome of the case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, the AJ excluded numerous witnesses from the hearing that caused substantial harm and prejudice to Whitmore's right and ability to present a complete whistleblower defense under<span class="Italic"> Carr.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the AJ erred in summarily excluding David Morgan and his interviewees from testifying at the hearing. The AJ's rationale for this exclusion was on relevance grounds, stating that the witnesses "are not material to the central issue in this matter, but rather have only peripheral relevance...." A75; <span class="Italic">see also</span> A19 ("I found Morgan's report of his investigation, and the employee interviews he attached to it, irrelevant to the charges at issue here."). The "central issue," in her mind, was the July 10, 2007 incident and the charges leveled against Whitmore; she found the alleged bias and impropriety pervading the Morgan investigation was not relevant to the charges. This was an abuse of discretion. The first two <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors plainly deem the strength of the agency's evidence and the existence of any retaliatory motive to be relevant considerations in determining whether the DOL has proven that an employee would have been removed regardless of his whistleblowing disclosures. <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323. Whitmore was entitled to introduce testimony calling into question the veracity and reliability of Morgan's report and the interviewees' statements therein, since at least some evidence in the record suggests that Morgan's report was relied on by Witt and Shalhoub in their decision to remove Whitmore. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., A748 (Witt's proposed removal notice stating that the situation revealed in Morgan's report formed "the basis for this proposal"); A138 (Witt admitting that Morgan's investigation formed "part of the support for Specification 1" of Whitmore's proposed removal); A292-93 (Shalhoub admitting that he relied on certain statements from the Morgan report). Indeed, the proposed removal notice itself extensively summarizes and quotes from the Morgan report. The AJ moreover dismissed Whitmore's contentions by suggesting that there was "nothing inappropriate" about Witt and Shalhoub relying on the witness statements gathered by Morgan, as opposed to Morgan's conclusions, but this fails to account for Whitmore's allegation that the statements themselves were selected in a biased fashion and were tampered with by Morgan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eleanor Lauderdale's testimony was excluded because Whitmore failed to timely provide the AJ with a detailed summary of Ms. Lauderdale's <span id="Page_3811"></span>testimony, as the AJ had requested. This was a reasonable request from the AJ, intended to discern whether Ms. Lauderdale was being offered as a mere character witness or for some other purpose. We see no abuse of discretion in excluding Ms. Lauderdale's testimony on this basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, it was an abuse of discretion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Finkel. Dr. Finkel was an OSHA whistleblower previously removed from his position and investigated by David Morgan. Although the AJ does not specifically explain her reasoning for excluding Finkel in particular, it appears that this decision was based on relevance grounds akin to those for excluding Morgan. A75 ("The remaining lengthy list of proposed witnesses on both sides were not approved since their proffered testimony was not relevant to the issues set for hearing at this time."). Finkel's testimony, to the extent it would show bias on the part of Morgan or OSHA against whistleblowers, was relevant to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors one and two as it would help to diminish the apparent strength of the agency's case against Whitmore and suggest a retaliatory motive. Finkel's testimony was also offered to discuss threats of violence made by other OSHA officials with no repercussions. This testimony would plainly be relevant under the third<span class="Italic"> Carr</span> factor which examines "any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated." <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323. Whitmore was entitled to offer this testimony to make his defense and attempt to show that his threats of violence were treated differently than threats made by non-whistleblower OSHA officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we hold that it is an abuse of discretion to categorically exclude all witnesses offered to testify as to evidence under the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors on relevance grounds. Doing so prevents whistleblowers from effectively presenting their defenses, and leaves only the agency's side of the case in play. This can have a substantial effect on the outcome of the case, and so constitutes harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Retaliatory Motive</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found "no evidence" to support a finding of a retaliatory motive, since Witt and Shalhoub were outside Whitmore's chain of command, were not directly implicated in any of Whitmore's whistleblowing, and had only limited knowledge of Whitmore's whistleblowing activity. The AJ noted in particular that both Witt and Shalhoub denied that Whitmore's whistleblowing disclosures affected their decisions to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To find zero evidence suggesting any retaliatory motive on this record is to take an unduly dismissive and restrictive view of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor two: "the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision." <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323. Those responsible for the agency's performance overall may well be motivated to retaliate even if they are not directly implicated by the disclosures, and even if they do not know the whistleblower personally, as the criticism reflects on them in their capacities as managers and employees. <span class="Italic">See Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1322-23; <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 17, 55 (2011) (finding motive to retaliate because proposing and deciding officials were high level officials and the disclosures "reflected on both of them as representatives of the general institutional interests of the agency"); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 73, 83 (2010) (finding that comments generally critical of agency's leadership "would reflect poorly on" officials "responsible for monitoring the performance of the field staff and making sure that agency regulations are carried out correctly and consistently").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Various emails in the record show that both Witt and Shalhoub, along with many other OSHA officials, were closely following Whitmore's whistleblowing disclosures and the effect they were having on OSHA in compelling OSHA to remedy the problems disclosed by Whitmore. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> A524-25 (email from Dubois, copying Goddard, forwarding Dave Schmidt's comments on Whitmore's congressional testimony); A526 (email chain including Goddard and Dubois concerning how to refute Whitmore's congressional testimony); A696-708 (email from Goddard and received by OSHA officials including Dubois, Poogach, Schmidt, and Shalhoub reprinting Charlotte Observer article quoting Whitmore); A715-17 (email to Goddard, Shalhoub and other OSHA officials forwarding article quoting Whitmore entitled "OSHA Turns Blind Eye to Underreporting"); A727 (email from Goddard to OSHA officials attaching article quoting Whitmore, and asking "Can an [sic] current employee on administrative leave go on record in the media, as an agency subject matter expert, discrediting the agency?"); A738-40 (Charlotte Observer article about congressional hearing sent to Witt, Goddard and Dubois, pointing to "Whitmore statements at the end"); A746-47 (email to Witt and Goddard concerning media coverage of issues of underreporting and worker safety on the Bay Bridge, which media coverage quotes Whitmore). This evidence plainly shows awareness and concern regarding the substance of Whitmore's disclosures by many high-level OSHA managers, including Witt and Shalhoub. Whitmore repeatedly cast OSHA and, by implication, all of the responsible OSHA officials, in a highly critical light by calling into question the propriety and honesty of their official conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a whistleblower makes such highly critical accusations of an agency's conduct, an agency official's merely being outside that whistleblower's chain of command, not directly involved in alleged retaliatory actions, and not personally named in the whistleblower's disclosure is insufficient to remove the possibility of a retaliatory motive or retaliatory influence on the whistleblower's treatment. Since direct evidence of a proposing or deciding official's retaliatory motive is typically unavailable (because such motive is almost always denied), federal employees are entitled to rely on circumstantial evidence to prove a motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Int'l Boundary &#x0026; Water Comm.,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 594, 613 (2011). Thus, "[w]hen applying the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the Board will consider any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency official who ordered the action, as well as any motive to retaliate on the part of other agency officials who influenced the decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 624-25; <span class="Italic">see also Phillips,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. at 82 (same). For example, the Board has held that a "proposing official's strong motive to retaliate may be imputed to a deciding official" in some circumstances. <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. at 48 (citing<span class="Italic"> Miller v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 610, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20 (2002)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ failed to consider the evidence suggesting the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of OSHA officials aside from Witt and Shalhoub, such as Dubois and Goddard, and the extent to which Witt and Shalhoub might have been influenced by such other OSHA officials. The record as discussed above includes several years' worth of evidence showing a pattern of Whitmore's whistleblowing disclosures followed by adverse personnel actions taken against Whitmore by his direct supervisors. Against this backdrop, Robert Poogach's April 14, 2009 email to David Morgan asks if Witt, who had nothing to do with Whitmore previously, may in fact have been "duped into signing [a removal proposal for] what [other OSHA officials] had long ago decided." Likewise, the Morgan report is alleged to have been written by Morgan, pursuant to OSHA's desire to avoid the appearance of retaliation, to contain a selective (if not falsified) version of the facts favorable to OSHA. The record contains evidence that supports this view of the circumstances surrounding Morgan's investigation. To the extent Morgan's report reflects and perpetuates retaliatory motives of the OSHA officials with whom Morgan worked and communicated, the report might also have influenced Witt and Shalhoub for purposes of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor two.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the AJ's reasoning, however, allegations of retaliatory motive in this context can easily be dispelled if the proposing and deciding officials are not directly named in whistleblowing disclosures, are outside of a whistleblower's chain of command, and simply deny having a retaliatory motive. We disagree. This reasoning flies in the face of congressional intent, and is a perfect example of why the agency is expected to carry a "high burden" to prove that Whitmore would have been removed regardless of his whistleblowing. 135 Cong. Rec. H747-48. Whitmore is at a particularly severe evidentiary disadvantage when it comes to proving the state of mind of OSHA officials if a mere denial is sufficient to remove the possibility of retaliatory motive.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span> Whitmore also has no control over the identity of the proposing and deciding officials or what documentation is created or maintained, whereas the agency can direct the course of an investigation and advantageously select officials several degrees removed from the whistleblower to help the agency's case withstand judicial scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In this manner the agency can "build" a more defensible case, as Whitmore alleges was done via the removal proposals and the Morgan report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, it is not unreasonable to suggest that Witt and Shalhoub might have developed or at least been influenced by retaliatory motives to remove Whitmore. In any event, the AJ clearly erred in finding that "no evidence" in the record supports Whitmore on <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor two. In fact, this finding is plainly inconsistent with the AJ's prior finding that "the timing of the agency's actual proposal to remove the appellant followed closely enough to the appellant's protected disclosures that one could reasonably conclude that his whistleblowing disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's removal action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ must reconsider the record under a more expansive view of what suffices to evidence the existence or strength of retaliatory motive consistent with this opinion, so that all the pertinent evidence may be properly weighed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Similarly Situated Non-Whistleblowers</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent Finkel's testimony concerning other actions by OSHA officials, the AJ had only Dubois's conduct for comparison to Whitmore's. Whitmore was removed, whereas Dubois faced no disciplinary action. Under<span class="Italic"> Carr</span> factor three, which inquires as to "any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated," the AJ believed that Dubois was not similarly situated to Whitmore since Whitmore was the instigator and the one who had threatened physical violence. A22; <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323. Thus, no meaningful comparison between the action taken against Whitmore and the lack of action against Dubois was made in evaluating Whitmore's whistleblower defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3812"></span>Board precedent under<span class="Italic"> Carr</span> factor three takes a narrow view of what it means for employees to be "similarly situated." "For other employees to be deemed similarly situated, the Board has held that all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be 'nearly identical' to those of the comparative employees." <span class="Italic">Spahn v. DOJ,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 195, 202 (2003). Regarding the employees' conduct, two employees are not similarly situated if there are "differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it." <span class="Italic">Godesky v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 280, 285-86 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot endorse the highly restrictive view of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three adopted by the AJ in this case. One can always identify characteristics that differ between two persons to show that their positions are not "nearly identical," or to distinguish their conduct in some fashion. <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> however, requires the comparison employees to be "similarly situated"--not identically situated--to the whistleblower. To read <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three so narrowly as to require virtual identity before the issue of similarly situated non-whistleblowers is ever implicated effectively reads this factor out of our precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Dubois and Whitmore were both in supervisory positions within the same branch of the same department at OSHA. They even operated within the same chain of command. Whitmore and Dubois were similarly situated from an employment position and responsibility perspective. <span class="Italic">Compare with Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1327 ("[t]he 'support' staff employees of the New Haven hearing office were not similarly situated to Ms. Carr. Significantly, those employees and the ALJs were supervised under separate chains of command. More importantly, as an ALJ, Ms. Carr held a position of trust and responsibility that was entirely different from the positions of the employees who made complaints about her.") (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In terms of their conduct, regardless of who initiated or escalated the various altercations, the record supports that both Whitmore and Dubois engaged in the same inappropriate and unprofessional conduct and hostility to large degree. The ultimate conditional threat of violence made by Whitmore certainly distinguishes the two, but for the most part Dubois's conduct could well be considered the very same kind of disruptive and intimidating behavior, conduct unbecoming a supervisor, and inappropriate conduct in the workplace for which Whitmore was charged. Dubois yelled, spat, and was openly hostile to Whitmore. Dubois also participated in perpetuating argumentative email threads between himself and Whitmore, copying uninvolved OSHA officials. To the extent Whitmore's conduct was the same as Dubois's, but was more frequent, serious, or unprofessional as a matter of degree, any meaningful <span class="Italic">overall</span> comparison also would have had to weigh the evidence in the record suggesting that Dubois was maliciously tampering with Whitmore's leave totals. Without weighing the evidence ourselves, we simply illustrate that a meaningful comparison between the conduct of Whitmore and Dubois can be made, but was not made in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of examining <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, the requisite degree of similarity between employees cannot be construed so narrowly that the only evidence helpful to the inquiry is completely disregarded. Differences in kinds and degrees of conduct between otherwise similarly situated persons within an agency can and should be accounted for to arrive at a well reasoned conclusion regarding <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, particularly where, as here, there was only a single person in the record for which a comparison can be made (Finkel's testimony having been excluded). Despite ultimately finding no evidence of similarly situated non-whistleblowers, even the AJ found Whitmore's contentions concerning Dubois's lack of any disciplinary action to be his "strongest argument in support of his affirmative defense." Yet by deeming Dubois not "similarly situated," the AJ did not examine how the disparity in treatment between Whitmore and Dubois should inform the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The whistleblower statute is clear that even where the charges have been sustained and the agency's chosen penalty is deemed reasonable, the agency must still prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have imposed the <span class="Italic">exact same penalty</span> in the absence of the protected disclosures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e) (providing that the agency must prove it would have taken "the <span class="Italic">same personnel action</span> in the absence of such disclosure") (emphasis added). Perhaps the most helpful inquiry in making this determination is <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, and its importance and utility should not be marginalized by reading it so narrowly as to eliminate it as a helpful analytical tool.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be clear, <span class="Italic">Carr</span> does not impose an affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence with respect to each and every one of the three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors to weigh them each individually in the agency's favor. The factors are merely appropriate and pertinent considerations for determining whether the agency carries its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the same action would have been taken absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323; <span class="Italic">see Kalil v. U.S.D.A.,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20071300479f3d82111300">479 F.3d 821</a>, 824 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting that "the [B]oard in <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> identified several factors that <span class="Italic">may be considered,</span> including [the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors].") (emphasis added, internal citation omitted). Indeed, the absence of any evidence relating to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three can effectively remove that factor from the analysis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCarthy v. Int'l Boundary and Water Comm.: U.S. &#x0026; Mexico,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 594, 626 (2011) (finding no evidence of the agency taking similar actions against similarly situated nonwhistleblowers, and therefore concluding that "the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is not a significant factor for the Board's analysis in the instant appeal"); <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 4, 13-14 (2003) (finding that whistleblower was lawfully removed based on the evidence under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors one and two, where the record contained no evidence of action taken against similarly situated non-whistleblowers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent such evidence exists, however, the agency is required to come forward with all reasonably pertinent evidence relating to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three. Failure to do so may be at the agency's peril. As a practical matter, the agency has far greater access to and control over evidence of prior disciplinary action taken against its employees than a whistleblower-employee typically does. The agency should liberally produce this evidence not only because any such evidence in its possession is plainly relevant and discoverable, but also to help the agency carry its overall burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the personnel action taken against the whistleblower would have been taken regardless of the whistleblowing. Stated differently, the absence of any evidence concerning <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three may well cause the agency to fail to prove its case overall. <span class="Italic">See Chambers,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. at 88 (finding that "we are simply not left with a 'definite and firm conviction' that the agency would have taken any action based on the sustained charges in the absence of her protected disclosures" in large part because the agency "did not show that it took similar actions against similarly-situated non-whistleblowers"); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 610, 621 (2002) ("[A]lthough the Board of Investigation report provided agency officials with evidence to support taking some disciplinary action against the appellants, this factor is far outweighed by the strong motive to retaliate by agency officials who were involved in these disciplinary actions and the lack of evidence showing that the agency took similar actions against otherwise similarly-situated non-whistleblowers.");<span class="Italic"> Russell v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 327-328 (M.S.P.B. 1997) ("Weighing the three factors..., we find that although the reporting officials had strong evidence to support their reports concerning the appellant, this factor is far outweighed by their strong motive to retaliate and the lack of any evidence showing that they treated non-whistleblower employees the same way they treated the appellant.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ must reconsider the evidence surrounding Dubois's conduct and lack of any repercussions, along with the testimony of Dr. Finkel, in a manner consistent with the scope of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three as expressed herein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">F.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Omissions From the AJ's Decision</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To reach her conclusions, the AJ focused strictly on the three charges and various specifications against Whitmore surrounding the July 10, 2007 incident, Whitmore's emails, and the sign Whitmore placed on his door. Whitmore's theory below and on appeal, however, is essentially as follows. Beginning in 2005 when Whitmore's whistleblowing started, the DOL and various managers at OSHA began to systematically create a hostile work environment for him as retaliation, primarily by making his ability to take leave to which he was entitled very difficult, and preventing him from obtaining any relief from other OSHA officials. Eventually, as intended by the DOL, the stress of this environment caused Whitmore such aggravation that he acted out in various ways against his better judgment. David Morgan was then brought in as a hired gun to help build a case that would withstand legal scrutiny for OSHA's removal of Whitmore. Witt and Shalhoub were then brought in to create an appearance of impartiality in the proposing and deciding officials, since they were both outside Whitmore's chain of command. This admittedly elaborate theory finds considerable evidentiary support in the record, and yet virtually none of the key evidence is acknowledged or alluded to--let alone discussed--in the AJ's decision. While we do not presume to re-weigh the evidence on appeal, we must note for the record at least the most prominent evidence in support of Whitmore's theory that must be examined and re-weighed on remand pursuant to the proper clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, while the AJ mentions the longstanding dispute between Whitmore and Dubois regarding Whitmore's leave usage and balances, there is no discussion of the fact that Whitmore's leave totals were shown to be incorrect by 75 hours, and that testimony suggested this was due to Dubois's intentionally and maliciously altering Whitmore's time sheets. The AJ does not discuss the fact that a mere two days after Whitmore reported Dubois' illegal gambling activities using office resources, Dubois removed Whitmore's rating authority over his subordinates. There is also no discussion of Robert Poogach's April 14, 2009 email to Dave Morgan indicating his confidence that OSHA can "make the case that [Whitmore's removal] is not tied to any protected activity," and questioning whether <span id="Page_3813"></span>Witt was simply "duped into signing [a removal proposal for] what we had long ago decided." Nor is there any discussion of how OSHA witnesses and their statements were selected and gathered for Morgan's investigation. The AJ makes no mention of the fact that, although Morgan's report was purportedly an independent investigation to assist the DOL in its disciplinary determination regarding Whitmore, Goddard's initial proposal to remove Whitmore in 2007 was authored two days prior to Morgan's report. Of course, the likely testimony of various witnesses excluded by the AJ was also not discussed because those witnesses never appeared at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps most glaringly absent from the AJ's decision is any serious discussion of the facts and circumstances surrounding how Whitmore's whistleblowing in 2005 marked the beginning of his increasingly strained relationships with OSHA officials, and how his disclosures paralleled his increasingly poor performance reviews and adverse personnel actions after decades of exceptional service. The AJ concluded that for purposes of Whitmore's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of whistleblower retaliation, "the timing of the agency's actual proposal to remove the appellant followed closely enough to the appellant's protected disclosures that one could reasonably conclude that his whistleblowing disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's removal action." However, this finding and the surrounding facts were never revisited in the context of the agency's burden to prove that it would have taken the same action against Whitmore regardless of his whistleblowing. The AJ did not consider the possibility that the conduct upon which Whitmore's removal was premised might never have occurred but for the DOL's retaliatory actions creating a hostile work environment for Whitmore. In exploring whether the DOL would have removed Whitmore in the absence of his whistleblowing, the AJ must concede this possibility and examine the evidence that supports it. Otherwise, any agency could take retaliatory action against whistleblowers by creating a hostile work environment for the whistleblower until the whistleblower acts out, then lawfully remove the whistleblower under the pretext of that later conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ thus reasoned through her opinion in a manner that ignores or overlooks essentially all of the evidence offered to support Whitmore's theory, and provides no explanation for why such evidence was inappropriate for consideration, unpersuasive, or otherwise not entitled to any weight. While the DOL urges us to affirm the MSPB's judgment as supported by substantial evidence, absent discussion in the AJ's decision to account for Whitmore's theory and the evidence on which he relies, we cannot meaningfully evaluate whether substantial evidence exists to support the AJ's conclusions. Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 347 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). Any determination by an AJ that is based on findings made in the abstract and independent of the evidence which fairly detracts from his or her conclusions is unreasonable and, as such, is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we acknowledge that the AJ may well have considered the countervailing evidence and rejected or discounted it for various reasons, with no basis in her opinion to understand her logic, we cannot say that her analysis is reasonable or complies with the law for how proof by clear and convincing evidence is to be evaluated. <span class="Italic">See Li Second Family,</span> 231 F.3d at 1381; <span class="Italic">Price,</span> 988 F.2d at 1196. Because considerable countervailing evidence was manifestly ignored, overlooked, or excluded, we must vacate and remand for consideration of all the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the various determinations and rulings of the AJ were "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)(1). We therefore set aside the judgment of the MSPB and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Conclusion</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The laws protecting whistleblowers from retaliatory personnel actions provide important benefits to the public, yet whistleblowers are at a severe evidentiary disadvantage to succeed in their defenses. Thus, the tribunals hearing those defenses must remain vigilant to ensure that an agency taking adverse employment action against a whistleblower carries its statutory burden to prove--by clear and convincing evidence--that the same adverse action would have been taken absent the whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite Robert Whitmore's highly unprofessional and intimidating conduct, which may well ultimately justify some adverse personnel action, he is nevertheless a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> whistleblower. Mr. Whitmore is therefore entitled to the full scope of protection afforded by the Whistleblower Protection Act, which ensures for him and whistleblowers everywhere that they need not fear retribution for disclosing to the public such vital information concerning an agency or official as "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or...gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Congress decided that we as a people are better off knowing than not knowing about such violations and improper conduct, even if it means that an insubordinate employee like Mr. Whitmore becomes, via such disclosures, more difficult to discipline or terminate. Indeed, it is in the presence of such non-sympathetic employees that commitment to the clear and convincing evidence standard is most tested and is most in need of preservation.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing decisions, <span class="Italic">Mohler v. DHS</span>, CH-1221-18-0119-W-2 (NP 7/18/2022), explained that the analysis of the agency's defensive evidence is multifactor, requiring analysis of all the facts and circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has met this burden, the Board will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> was applied by the Board in <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 118 MSPR 308, 310-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-8, 2012 MSPB 87 (2012) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Massie v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...After reviewing the testimony and documentary evidence, the administrative judge found that, while Merritt knew that the appellant claimed to be a whistleblower after he filed an earlier IRA appeal in 2009, there was no evidence that she knew of his disclosures or that she considered them when she wrote his performance appraisal. Moreover, the administrative judge found that the evidence supported Merritt's determination that the appellant adequately, though minimally, performed his duties such that, while he received a cash award for his work on a particular project, he failed to provide outstanding contributions to the agency's mission and therefore did not merit an SCI. The administrative judge further found that the appellant's co-worker, a self-styled whistleblower who had also disclosed to the IG information regarding the agency's dealings with Eclipse Aviation and who was also supervised by Merritt, did receive an SCI, thereby supporting Merritt's claim that it was the appellant's performance that caused her to evaluate him as she did. The administrative judge found that there was strong evidence to support Merritt's performance appraisal and determination not to give the appellant an SCI, no evidence on Merritt's part of retaliatory motive, and no evidence that the agency failed to take similar actions against similarly situated non-whistleblowers, and she therefore concluded that the agency had presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions absent the appellant's disclosures....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions against the appellant, even absent any protected disclosures, the administrative judge considered the three factors which the Board and the court have considered appropriate: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of agency officials involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 23 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, our reviewing court has recently issued a decision providing further guidance regarding the Board's consideration of the evidence presented by an agency in an effort to meet its clear and convincing evidence burden. <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, the court stated that "[e]vidence only clearly and convincingly supports a conclusion when it does so in the aggregate considering all the pertinent evidence in the record, and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1368. The court further determined that "[i]t is error for the [Board] to not evaluate all the pertinent evidence in determining whether an element of a claim or defense has been proven adequately." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Upon its review in <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, the court found that the administrative judge had taken an unduly dismissive and restrictive view on the issue of the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate by the agency, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1370-72, and that remand for further fact finding was necessary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1372, 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge's analysis of Merritt's motive to retaliate was similarly inadequate. In his prehearing submission, the appellant contended that Merritt and Kimberly Smith, the Directorate manager, were highly motivated to retaliate against him because, among other things, they were responsible for briefing FAA headquarters on the IG investigation's findings. The appellant also noted that Merritt had a reason to retaliate against him because the IG interviewed her regarding his whistleblower complaints, some managers were called before Congress to defend the agency's actions, and at least one agency manager was reprimanded as a result of the Eclipse Aviation investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge failed to consider in his analysis the effect that the Eclipse Aviation investigation had upon Merritt or other agency managers. Rather, the administrative judge focused on the strength of Merritt's testimony that she was unaware of any specific disclosure that the appellant may have made, her testimony that the appellant's performance was merely adequate, and evidence that a similarly situated co-worker of the appellant, the self-styled whistleblower discussed above, received a performance award from Merritt. As set forth above, the administrative judge's analysis of this issue was not based on all of the evidence, considered as a whole. Accordingly, the appeal must be remanded for further consideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Mattil v. Dept. of State</span>, 118 MSPR 662, 669-70, 674-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 25-31, 2012 MSPB 127 (2012), the Board disapproved of bifurcation, as it returned the IRA appeal to an AJ for adjudication:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there are times when an administrative judge may properly determine whether the agency met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel actions at issue absent the appellant's alleged whistleblowing before proceeding to whether the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, such an approach is not always appropriate. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-31 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2011-3239, 2012 U.S. App. Lexis 21262 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 15, 2012). Instead, certain circumstances require adjudication of both the merits of the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as well as the agency's affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-32. These circumstances arise where the substance of the alleged disclosure, as well as the extent to which the retaliating official was aware of the disclosure, is relevant to retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such is the case here. For example, the substance of the appellant's first disclosure is intertwined with his claim that his immediate supervisor was concerned with the effect of that disclosure on his own career. The administrative judge did not address this claim in determining that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel actions at issue absent the appellant's alleged whistleblowing. We, therefore, find that remand for a complete adjudication of the issues in this appeal is required, including the opportunity for further discovery and the submission of documentary evidence and hearing testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2012), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit explained how the Board should evaluate the record in determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel actions at issue absent an appellant's whistleblowing. It explained that whether evidence is sufficiently clear and convincing to meet this burden of proof is not determined by examining only the evidence that supports the ultimate conclusion reached. 680 F.3d. at 1368. Instead, evidence satisfies this burden of proof only when it is considered with all the pertinent record evidence and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court further specifically stated that it is error to not evaluate all the pertinent evidence in determining whether an element of a claim or defense has been adequately proven. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court then applied this standard in evaluating the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323, for determining whether an agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel actions at issue absent the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1368-75. These factors include the strength of the agency's evidence supporting its personnel action, the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision, and any evidence that the agency took similar actions against employees who were not whistleblowers but who were otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3815"></span>In examining retaliatory motive, the court cautioned the Board against taking an unduly dismissive and restrictive view, noting that, where the whistleblowing disclosure reflects on agency officials in their capacities as managers and employees, or is highly critical of an agency's conduct, agency officials may be motivated to retaliate even when they are not directly implicated by the disclosures, do not know the whistleblower personally, are outside the whistleblower's chain of command, were not directly involved in the alleged retaliatory actions, or were not personally named in the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370-72. The court further stated that, when applying the retaliatory motive factor, the Board should consider any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency official who ordered the action, as well as any motive to retaliate on the part of other agency officials who influenced the decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court then discussed the similarly situated non-whistleblower factor, noting that Board precedent has taken an unduly narrow view of the meaning of "similarly situated" in determining whether an agency met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the alleged personnel actions in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1373. The court criticized Board precedent requiring that the appellant's employment situation be "nearly identical" to the comparison employees, finding that <span class="Italic">Carr</span> requires the comparison employees to be "similarly situated" rather than identically situated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court then explained that the "requisite degree of similarity between employees cannot be construed so narrowly that the only evidence helpful to the inquiry is completely disregarded." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court added that "[d]ifferences in kinds and degrees of conduct between otherwise similarly situated persons within an agency can and should be accounted for to arrive at a well-reasoned conclusion..., particularly where...there was only a single person in the record for which a comparison can be made." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1373-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge focused almost exclusively on the hearing testimony in making his clear and convincing evidence determination. In doing so, he mainly discussed the agency's testimony supporting its reason for taking the actions at issue. In fact, the administrative judge did not discuss any evidence supporting the appellant's position for some of these alleged personnel actions at issue. As such, the initial decision does not meet the requirement in <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> that an initial decision examine all the pertinent record evidence, rather than focusing on only the evidence supporting the ultimate conclusion reached.[3] 680 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the administrative judge relied heavily upon credibility determinations, including demeanor observations, in reaching his ultimate conclusion, and such credibility determinations are typically entitled to deference on review. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, however, requires more than just an evaluation of testimonial evidence and instead specifically requires an evaluation of all of the pertinent record evidence. 680 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's petition for review, however, is replete with allegations identifying specific evidence, both documentary and testimonial, weighing against finding that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the actions at issue absent the appellant's whistleblowing. In making this observation, we note that the administrative judge properly rejected the appellant's attempt to submit some of the referenced documents because the appellant failed to timely submit them. Many of the documents in the appellant's rejected submission, however, are still properly in the record because they are duplicated in the agency file and should, therefore, be considered in the <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision also omits discussion or meaningful analysis of the appellant's claims that his supervisor expressed a motive to retaliate against the appellant for his whistleblowing because the supervisor feared that the appellant's action would hamper the supervisor's career, and that the appellant was the only OAT employee denied an extension and whose position was threatened with elimination. In determining whether the agency met its burden of proof, the administrative judge should analyze all of the record evidence in accordance with the instruction in <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> and make thoroughly reasoned findings that address both the evidence supporting his conclusion and the countervailing evidence. <span class="Italic">See Massie v. Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 308, 310-12 (2012).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hugenberg v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 120 MSPR 381, 390 &#x00B6; 20, 2013 MSPB 92 (2013), commented, as the Board remanded the appeal for reconsideration of the AJ's exclusion of some witnesses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that our reviewing court has provided guidance regarding the Board's consideration of the evidence presented by an agency in an effort to meet its clear and convincing evidence burden. In <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, the court stated that "[e]vidence only clearly and convincingly supports a conclusion when it does so in the aggregate considering all the pertinent evidence in the record, and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion." <span class="Italic">Whitmore v.

The court further held that "[i]t is error for the [Board] to not evaluate all the pertinent evidence in determining whether an element of a claim or defense has been proven adequately." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the administrative judge on remand shall make findings on the clear and convincing evidence issue in accordance with <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Board still allowed for the possibility of bifurcated hearings in what it called unusual cases, stating, without reference to the WPEA, in <span class="Italic">Herman v. DOJ</span>, 119 MSPR 642, 651-52 &#x00B6; 19, 2013 MSPB 60 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the administrative judge's evidentiary rulings were occasioned, at least in part, by his decision to bifurcate the hearing and proceed directly to the clear and convincing evidence issue without deciding whether the appellant made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor to a personnel action. The Board and its administrative judges have historically sought judicial economy through this procedural option, especially in the context of IRA appeals, which can be very factually intensive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Sutton v.

However, after the administrative judge issued his initial decision, the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, in which the court cautioned the Board against unduly restricting evidence in whistleblower claims. We do not think that <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> or <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 618 F.3d 1306, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2010), in which the court stated its preference that the Board resolve all issues in an IRA appeal, necessarily foreclose bifurcated hearings or proceeding directly to the agency's rebuttal case under appropriate circumstances. However, we do think that they require the Board to use care in doing so and to reserve bifurcation for unusual cases. Above all, administrative judges should bear in mind that some matters pertinent to the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case may also be relevant to the agency's rebuttal case. <span class="Italic">Compare Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 16 (2012) (the appellant bears the burden of showing a nexus between the disclosure and the personnel action) <span class="Italic">with Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (with respect to the agency's rebuttal case, the Board will consider the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials involved). In other words, full and fair consideration of the appellant's claims may require adjudication of both the merits of his showing of a contributing factor as well as the agency's affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCarthy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-32.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> controls the analysis, there must first be proof of a protected disclosure. If there is no protected disclosure, the IRA analysis ends, <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210212128">846 Fed. Appx. 886</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Taking Ms. Brown's second argument first, the "clear and convincing" burden only shifts to the agency if the employee shows "by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she made a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) that was a contributing factor to the [personnel action taken against the employee]." <span class="Italic">Whitmore v.

Because Ms. Brown failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that she made a protected disclosure, the clear and convincing evidence burden never shifted to the Air Force.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 101, 116-17 n.2 (2004), decided before <span class="Italic">Whitmore,</span> explained the permissible variations in the order of proof, depending on whether a case is an IRA or an otherwise appealable action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant files an individual right of action (IRA) appeal regarding a personnel action that is not appealable to the Board in the absence of a whistleblower reprisal claim, the Board must first determine whether it has jurisdiction over the appeal before it has the authority to consider the merits of the whistleblowing claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Department of the Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (in an IRA appeal, the Board may not assume that the appellant has established jurisdiction over his appeal and then proceed to reject his whistleblower reprisal claim on the merits; rather, the Board must first address the matter of jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of the appeal). Thus, before an administrative judge may consider the merits of an IRA appeal, including determining whether the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing, the administrative judge must first determine that the appellant exhausted his remedies before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and nonfrivolously alleged that he made a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). However, when an appellant files an appeal directly with the Board concerning an otherwise appealable action, the Board's jurisdiction to consider the affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing activity is derived from the statute or regulation that confers jurisdiction on the Board to consider the underlying action and from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), which requires the Board to determine whether the appellant showed that the agency decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) (including whistleblower reprisal described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)), rather than from the IRA provisions found in chapter 12 of title 5, United States Code. Thus, when an appellant raises whistleblower reprisal as an affirmative defense to an otherwise appealable action, administrative judges are not bound by the IRA jurisdictional restrictions and are free to address the elements of the whistleblower defense in the order they find most efficient, including proceeding to a determination as to whether the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing without first determining: (1) that the appellant exhausted his remedies before OSC; and (2) that the appellant established or made nonfrivolous allegations that he made protected disclosures and that the disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take the otherwise appealable personnel action.</p>

Cir. 2010), the Board's reviewing court decided that the Board should, in one decision, consider and decide all aspects of an IRA appeal once it determines that it has jurisdiction over the appeal, so that repeated remands are not required to consider components of the appeal on the merits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, had we agreed with Kahn in this appeal, we would have again remanded the case to the Board to determine whether the DEA had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have transferred Kahn to the Atlanta Field Office independent of his protected disclosure. To avoid such inefficiency in the future, the Board should resolve all contested issues on the merits after a petitioner in a whistleblowing case has established jurisdiction and is entitled to a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">Cf. Simmons Fastener Corp. v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc.</span>, 739 F.2d 1573, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (directing district courts to decide both infringement and validity before final judgment). Accordingly, in a hearing on the merits, the Board should make findings on whether (1) the acting official had the authority to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action; (2) the aggrieved employee made a disclosure protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); (3) the acting official used his authority to take, or refuse to take, a personnel action against the aggrieved employee; (4) the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action; and (5) the agency would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Chambers</span>, 602 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Fellhoelter</span>, 568 F.3d at 970-71. If the Board finds one of those contested issues dispositive, it should nevertheless resolve the remaining issues to expedite resolution of a case on appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kahn</span> declined the appellant's invitation to consider the agency's affirmative defense because it agreed with the Board that the appellant failed to establish his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the court stated in dicta that, in an IRA appeal, even where the Board finds a contested merits issue dispositive, it should nevertheless resolve the remaining issues to expedite resolution of the case on appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We note, however, that after <span class="Italic">Kahn</span> was decided, Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2) to provide that corrective action cannot be ordered if, "<span class="Italic">after</span> a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor," the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.

<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, the clear and convincing evidentiary test comes into play only after the Board finds that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor to the challenged personnel action, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOJ</span>, DA-3330-15-0612-I-1 (NP 9/27/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's alternative finding that, even if the appellant established that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in his nonselection, the agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action, even absent those disclosures. In <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 618 F.3d 1306, 1316 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">In an adverse action appeal involving a whistleblowing reprisal affirmative defense, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. EPA</span>, 118 MSPR 161, 168-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-20, 2012 MSPB 70 (2012), bifurcation of the proof was improper; the appeal was remanded when prior analysis by the AJ of whether the agency's proof of misconduct was by clear and convincing evidence precluded evaluation of the existence and extent of retaliatory motive based on proof of the appellant's disclosures and the extent that relevant management officials knew of the disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge bifurcated the hearing and limited the evidence at the first hearing to "the agency's proof of the charges by preponderant evidence and the agency's proof by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the removal action in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing activity." In response to the appellant's request for clarification, the administrative judge indicated that the appellant would not be permitted to present evidence relating to her protected disclosures or her claims of retaliation in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) and (12) during the first hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) prohibits any federal agency from taking, failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, any personnel action against an employee in a covered position because of the disclosure of information that the employee reasonably believes to be evidence of a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement or a waste of funds, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), (b)(8). In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the WPA, the appellant must prove, by preponderant evidence, that she made a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in an adverse action against her. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). If the appellant makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim of reprisal for whistleblowing, the agency is given an opportunity to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); see <span class="Italic">Fellhoelter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 568 F.3d 965, 970-71 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Schnell v. Department of the Army,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 18 (2010). In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, although there are times when it is appropriate <span id="Page_3817"></span>to determine whether the agency has met its burden by clear and convincing evidence before proceeding to whether the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, such an approach is not always appropriate. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-31 (2011). Rather, under certain circumstances, the Board has held that full and fair consideration of an appellant's claims requires adjudication of both the merits of her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as well as the agency's affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-32 (adjudication of both the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency's affirmative defense was required where both the substance of the appellant's alleged protected disclosures, as well as the extent to which the deciding official was aware of it, were relevant to the issue of retaliatory motive). We find that such circumstances exist in the present case. Without evidence regarding the appellant's alleged disclosures and the extent to which the relevant management officials were aware of those disclosures, it is impossible to properly evaluate the existence and extent of any retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Ryan v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 14 (2012). By bifurcating the agency's presentation of evidence regarding the charge and its evidence of clear and convincing evidence from the appellant's evidence regarding her affirmative defenses, the administrative judge artificially separated the removal decision from the appellant's affirmative defenses, when in fact the removal and the appellant's affirmative defenses are intertwined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that bifurcation of the hearing denied the appellant a full opportunity to present evidence regarding her claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) and (12). Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) prohibits any employee who has the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, to take any personnel action against any employee "because of[] (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation; [or] (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 2302(b)(12) prohibits the taking of a personnel action when "such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in [5 U.S.C.] section 2301." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of subsection (b)(9), the appellant must demonstrate that she engaged in an activity protected by the section; that she was subsequently treated in an adverse fashion by the employer; that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected activity; and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984). Where, as here, the agency has already articulated a non-retaliatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct, it has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Thus, our inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, weighing all the evidence, the appellant has met her burden of proving illegal retaliation. <span class="Italic">Crump v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">see U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983). The Board has not previously established the precise elements for proving a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12). However, under the circumstances of this appeal, we find that it is appropriate to proceed directly to the ultimate question of whether, weighing all the evidence, the appellant has met her burden of proving that the agency's removal action violated a law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301. <span class="Italic">Cf. MacLean v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-27 (2011) (finding it unnecessary to decide the specific legal framework applicable to claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) because the outcome was the same under either the analytic framework applicable to Title VII claims or the framework applicable to claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)). Because the appellant has the ultimate burden of proof with respect to her claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) and (12), she must be given the opportunity to present evidence in support of those claims on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge's bifurcation of the hearing adversely affected the appellant's ability to receive a fair adjudication of her affirmative defenses in relation to the agency's action based on all of the relevant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Stein-Verbit v. Department of Commerce,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 332, 338-42 (1996) (the administrative judge's decision to bifurcate the charges under the circumstances of the case constituted an abuse of discretion where the decision incurred on the appellant's right to present a full defense and to have a meaningful right to a hearing). We find, therefore, that the interest in simplifying the hearing in this case is outweighed by the incursion on the appellant's right to present a full defense and to have a meaningful right to a hearing. We find that we must remand this appeal to allow the appellant to fully develop the record with documentary and testimonial evidence relevant to her affirmative defenses under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), (9), and (12).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Until the law changed in 2012, AJs frequently inverted the order of proof in IRA cases involving disciplinary action, decided that the agency clearly would have taken the disciplinary action and avoid further analysis of whistleblowing reprisal. Given the proclivity of the Board to sustain adverse actions when the facts and charges permit those actions to be sustained, it was impossible to define through caselaw how the Board's usual analysis of disciplinary action and deference toward agency penalty decisions was somehow different under the "clear and convincing evidence" standard. As a practical matter, inversion of the order of proof was at best an artifice. Since one of the issues would be the intensity of the motive of agency official to retaliate, putting the agency in the position of proving "clear and convincing" evidence of the reasonableness of the challenged personnel action, leaving the appellant to prove the equivalent of pretext, confused both the analysis and the participants in an IRA case. Abandonment of the bifurcation approach was proper: the appellant should be able to lead off with his or her case in chief, establishing the background of the case and the basis for the reprisal allegation, leaving the agency to its defenses.</p>
