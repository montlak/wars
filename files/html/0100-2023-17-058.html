<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-57"><span class="space">E.</span> MANAGEMENT RIGHTS; PROCEDURES AND ARRANGEMENTS; IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The management rights structure is complex in its application to arbitration awards. 5 USC 7106, providing definition, states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7106.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management rights</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;to determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices of the agency; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;in accordance with applicable laws--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;to hire, assign, direct, layoff, and retain employees in the agency, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;to assign work, to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;any other appropriate source; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_1774"></span>(D)&#x2003;to take whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the agency mission during emergencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;at the election of the agency, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.</p>
<p class="noindent">The management rights provisions of 5 USC 7106 do not provide a basis for determining that a grievance is not arbitrable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1045 and VAMC Biloxi</span>, 64 FLRA 520, 522 (2010); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA OHO and IFPTE AALJs</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-21.html">72 FLRA 108</a>, 110 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting in part) ("The Authority has repeatedly held that the management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute do not provide a basis for finding a grievance non-arbitrable."). Conversely, a grievance is arbitrable (although other exceptions to the resulting award may lie) despite even a successful claim that the resultant award infringes management rights, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 61 FLRA 72, 75 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CBP's management's rights arbitrability exceptions are misplaced because they ignore applicable Authority precedent. The Authority has consistently held that the management's rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute do not provide a basis for finding grievances non-arbitrable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Pac. Missile Test Ctr., Point Mugu, Ca</span>l., 43 FLRA 157, 159 (1991); <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency</span>, 32 FLRA 739, 748-49 (1988); <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 631-35 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Newark</span>); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Support Base, Pac., Barstow, Cal.</span>, 3 FLRA 397, 398-99 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Barstow</span>). As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Newark</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The proper phase of the arbitration proceeding in which to determine the impact or application of [&#x00A7;] 7106 is not at the outset so as to preclude by law an arbitrator from having jurisdiction over the matter.

<p class="noindent">The structure of the Statute makes the exercise of management rights defined under &#x00A7; 7106(a) subject to negotiated procedures for the exercise of those rights (&#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)); negotiated "appropriate arrangements" for employees adversely affecting by the exercise of management rights (&#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)); and, at the election of the agency, other topics affecting how work is organization and directed, so-called permissive subjects of bargaining (&#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)). In addition to those procedures, arrangements, and permissive topics of negotiations in derogation of management rights, there is the qualifying phrase that management rights described in &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) by exercised in accordance with applicable laws. FLRA interprets 5 USC 7106(a)(2), establishing the right of management to fill positions and assign work, among other functions, "in accordance with applicable laws," to allow an arbitrator to determine if management has exercised its authority in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; if not, the arbitrator may direct a remedy, <span class="Italic">DOD, Illinois NG, Scott AFB and ACT Chapter 111</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-49.html">69 FLRA 345</a>, 347-48 (2016), involving a challenge to a selection for a supervisory position:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, there is no dispute that Agency regulation TPP 335 is mandatory and establishes the obligations of the Agency and the rights of employees with respect to promotions and assignments within the Agency. Accordingly, the first requirement is satisfied. As to the second requirement, Congress has expressly authorized the President of the United States to prescribe rules governing the competitive service, and the President has, in turn, so authorized the U. S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).[40] Consistent with this authority, OPM has promulgated rules governing agency promotion and placement programs from which TPP 335 is derived.[41] As to the final requirement, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)[42] specifically exempts matters relating to agency management and personnel from the notice and comment requirements otherwise required for regulations by the APA.[43] Accordingly, the third requirement is satisfied. We conclude that the TPP 335 is a regulation having the force and effect of law, and thus constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Agency regulation TPP 335 when it selected for the supervisor position an applicant who was unqualified.&#x2003;According to the Arbitrator, the only qualified applicants were the two grievants. It is well established that the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings, unless a finding has been successfully challenged as a nonfact, which is not the case here.[44] In his award, the Arbitrator credited the testimony of the retired, former supervisor who testified about the requirements for the position as given in the job announcement, namely the thirty-six months of technical experience with the equipment at issue, and who testified that only the two grievants had that required experience and that the selectee did not. While the Agency challenges the credibility and persuasiveness of the former supervisor's testimony, we have already determined that the "missing" resumes are barred under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5, and the Agency does not provide any other support for its challenge. Therefore, as the Agency's arguments lack support in the record, we find the Agency's arguments to be bare assertions.[45] Finally, we note TPP 335 requires that candidates meet the basic qualifications established for the position.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, as the award is based on the Arbitrator's enforcement of an "applicable law," the Agency fails to establish that the award impermissibly affects its management right to select employees. The Agency does not successfully challenge the Arbitrator's factual findings or otherwise demonstrate that the award misapplies the Agency regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Authority notes that the Agency did argue very briefly that the award also infringed on its right to assign work, and cited as support for this argument two negotiability decisions.[47] Nonetheless, even assuming the argument was sufficiently raised and even assuming the Agency's right to assign work was affected by the award, the Arbitrator was enforcing an applicable law, as discussed above. Therefore, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award impermissibly affects its right to assign work.[48]</p>

Office for Immigration Review and AFGE Local 3525</span>, 65 FLRA 657, 662-63 (2011), involving an arbitrator's determination that the agency violated its performance appraisal program when it prepared the grievant's performance appraisal and denied her a within-grade increase:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions that contend that an award is contrary to a management right, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of a right set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring). If the award affects the right, then the Authority examines whether the arbitrator was enforcing either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency cites <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153, which involves the effect of an arbitrator's cancellation of performance ratings on an agency's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. The Authority has held that an arbitrator's cancellation of a performance appraisal affects these management rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Carderock Div., Acoustic Research Detachment, Bayview, Idaho</span>, 59 FLRA 763, 765 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring). As the Arbitrator directed the Agency to rescind the performance appraisal challenged by the grievant, we find that the award affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the PAP, but did not find any violations of the parties' agreement. Because the Arbitrator's cancellation of the grievant's performance rating is based solely on the Agency's violations of the PAP, this remedy is valid only if the PAP constitutes an applicable law under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency regulation constitutes an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) when it has "the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA 377, 390-91 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds</span> 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C.

Regulations have the force and effect of law when they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 690; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA at 391-93. Applying this standard, the Authority has held that agency performance appraisal regulations enacted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and corresponding Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations constitute "applicable law" under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 690-91.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first requirement--that a regulation affect individual rights--is satisfied where the regulation is mandatory and establishes the obligations of agencies and the rights of employees. <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 690; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA at 391. As in <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the PAP regulations "oblige the agency to conduct the performance appraisal process in a particular manner and affect the rights of individual employees to obtain a particular summary performance rating." 55 FLRA at 690-91. Specifically, the section of the PAP violated by the Agency states that the "appraisal period <span class="Italic">shall </span>cover one year[.]" This wording affects the obligation of the Agency and the right of the employees. Thus, the first requirement has been met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second requirement is that the regulation was promulgated pursuant to a Congressional delegation of legislative authority.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 690; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA at 392. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, each agency is required to establish performance appraisal systems that are consistent with OPM regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">See Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 691. The PAP lists both 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and the OPM regulations as authority for its creation and references the OPM regulations throughout. In addition, there is no claim that the PAP is inconsistent with either the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 or corresponding OPM regulations. Accordingly, the PAP meets the second requirement. <span class="Italic">See Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 691.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final requirement is that the regulation was "promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by Congress." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Section 553(a)(2) of Title 5 excepts agency rulemaking relating to agency management and personnel, such as the PAP, from the notice and comment requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, performance appraisal regulations must be promulgated under OPM regulations, which require agencies to submit their performance appraisal regulations to OPM for approval. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.209. If OPM determines that an agency performance appraisal regulation does not meet statutory or regulatory requirements, then "it shall direct the agency to implement an appropriate system or program or to take other corrective action." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.210. As a result, the Authority has held that where performance appraisal regulations have existed for an extended period of time and OPM has not directed an agency to take corrective action, the Authority may reasonably conclude that the regulations were promulgated in conformance with the appropriate procedural requirements. <span class="Italic">See Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 691. Here, neither party addresses this issue. However, the PAP had been in effect for over four and a half years at the time of the Arbitrator's award. Thus, we conclude that the PAP was promulgated in conformance with OPM requirements, and we find that the PAP was validly promulgated. <span class="Italic">See Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 691.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that PAP is an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), and that the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a). Consequently, we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's well-established precedent, when a party alleges that an arbitrator's award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted right.[25] If the award affects the right, then the Authority examines, as relevant here, whether the award provides a remedy for a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b).[26] The Authority places the burden on the party arguing that the award is contrary to management rights to allege not only that the award affects a right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), but also that the enforced provision is not the type of contract provision that falls within &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent">Over time, FLRA has shifted its approach to exceptions by agencies claiming that awards involving "appropriate arrangements" interfere with management rights. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990), determined that when an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a), FLRA will examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights, and if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right. If the exercise of the management right was not abrogated, the award stands. Then, in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 111, 115-17 (2002), FLRA switched from the "abrogation" standard to an "excessive interference" test, and it did so with recognition of the significance of the change but with little if any explanation in the majority opinion for the change. Member Pope noted in her concurrence that "the change will tilt the playing field not only in arbitration but also at the bargaining table, permitting agencies to gain concessions from unions by agreeing to provisions that the agencies can later claim excessively interfere with its rights in arbitration."

The Authority will apply the three-part framework established in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP</span>[39] (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>) to evaluate such claims, but only in "cases where the awards or remedies affect[ ] a management right."[40] When applying the three-question test established in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the first question is whether the arbitrator has found a violation of a contract provision; if the answer to that question is yes, then the second question is whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that violation.[41] If the answer to the second question is yes, then the third question is whether <span id="page_1776"></span>the award excessively interferes with the &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right.[42] If the answer to this question is yes, then the award is contrary to law and must be set aside.[43]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we construe CBP's claim that the award would disrupt its disciplinary process as an assertion that the award affects management's right to discipline employees. When resolving an exception which contends that the award is contrary to a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first considers whether the award affects the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Div. Newport, Newport, R.I.,</span> 63 FLRA 222, 225 (2009). In this case, the award does not affect CBP's right to discipline an employee. Rather, the award merely requires CBP, in disciplining an employee, to comply with its regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is the agency's responsibility to make a record demonstrating violation of a management right. In a case reviewing an arbitrator's award involving flexiplace work under an agreement, FLRA noted the absence from the record of a policy that the agency claimed to have been infringed, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Office of Medicare Hearings &#x0026; Appeals and NTEU Chap. 229</span>, 65 FLRA 175, 177 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's management-rights exceptions are premised on the Agency's claim that it has a policy forbidding the removal of Medicare files from its offices. However, the Arbitrator made no finding about such a policy in his award, and the record contains no evidence regarding such a policy. As there is no evidence to establish the existence of this policy, and the Agency presented no other arguments related to management's rights on appeal, we find that the Agency has not established that the award affects the cited management rights as alleged. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Chi.

<p class="noindent">If the grievance and award do not involve application of an arrangements clause, the award will be reviewed under traditional tests to determine whether it interferes with the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 2</span>, 49 FLRA 1363, 1367-68 (1994). If the award applies a government-wide regulatory requirement, e.g., an OPM RIF regulation, the excessive interference test, applicable only to contractually-negotiated provisions, does not apply to the analysis of the validity of the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force and AFGE Local 997</span>, 61 FLRA 797, 800 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">For FLRA to consider exceptions based on a violation of management rights (including a remedy that violates management rights), the issue concerning management rights must have been presented to the arbitrator if the issue could have been raised with the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See SSA Newark and AFGE Local 2369,</span> 64 FLRA 259, 260 (2009); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 68</span>, 63 FLRA 202, 205 (2009); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 62 FLRA 416, 417 (2008). If management does not raise a management rights issue, and if the arbitrator does not create that issue, there is no management rights issue to resolve, even if the union raises it with the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 299 and Dept. of Treasury, OCC</span>, 68 FLRA 835, 837 (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to a seniority-based assignment system, <span class="Italic">VA St. Cloud Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 390</span>, 62 FLRA 508, 509-11 (2008), summed up the analysis involving permissible infringements on management rights by arbitration awards before FLRA's (temporary) return to the abrogation test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When resolving an exception that alleges an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If it does, then the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Under prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a) (2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 153. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the award reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had management not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously stated, under prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a) (2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See </span>53 FLRA at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties dispute whether Article 12 constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In determining whether a contract provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB and General Counsel of the NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA 576, 579 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope dissenting on other grounds (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 978, 981 (2004)) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the provision is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA at 579. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citation omitted).<span class="Italic"> </span>The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate only those employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this regard, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals and provisions that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the provision is an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A provision excessively interferes with a management right if the benefits afforded employees under the provision are outweighed by the burdens imposed on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Fed. Satellite Low, La Tuna, Tex.</span>, 59 FLRA 374, 376 (2003) (Member Pope concurring) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Okla. City, Okla., </span>58 FLRA 109, 111 (2002) (Chairman Cabaniss and Member Armendariz concurring; Member Pope concurring as to result)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that Article 12 constitutes an arrangement, for the following reasons, we find that it does not constitute an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign employees.</p>
