<p class="noindent">FLRA concluded that &#x00A7; 709(e) of the Technicians Act precluded it from reviewing through ULP proceedings the assertion that his dismissal as a technician resulted from termination of his military status for union activities. FLRA followed court decisions determining that, as to negotiability of grievance procedures for technicians, Congress intended that the state adjutants general have the final authority over adverse personnel actions against National Guard technicians. <span class="Italic">DOD, Illinois Air Nat'l Guard, 182nd Tactical Air Support Group, Peoria and Illinois Air Chap. 34, ACT</span>, 19 FLRA 101, 104-05 (1985).</p>

FLRA</span>, 239 F.3d 66 (1st Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>, described FLRA's jurisdiction to remedy ULPs committed in units of civilian National Guard employees, although FLRA noted that it could not order the reinstatement of a Guardsman:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that it is a state agency and that, therefore, we do not have jurisdiction over it. For the purposes of the Statute, however, the Respondent is also a federal agency and must comply with the Statute's mandates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Guard has both state and federal functions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See New Jersey Air National Guard v. FLRA,</span> 677 F.2d 276, 278-79 (3d Cir. 1982) <span class="Italic">(New Jersey</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard) </span>(The National Guard is "hybrid" with both state and federal functions.). Because the National Guard is not a full-time active force, it employs "civilian 'technicians' to perform administrative, clerical, and technical tasks." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard Bureau, Rhode Island National Guard, Rhode</span> <span class="Italic">Island v. FLRA, </span>982 F.2d 577, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1993). These technicians are federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2105. When the state National Guards administer the technicians program, they act in their federal capacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Technicians Act, 32 USC &#x00A7; 709(c) (The Secretary of the Army or the Air Force, as the case may be, "shall designate the adjutants general...to employ and administer the technicians authorized by this section.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal case law makes clear that state National Guard units act as federal agencies in matters concerning the employment of technicians.[6] Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held, in a case related to this one, that in matters arising under the Statute, "the Guard is being sued in its capacity as a federal agency." <span class="Italic">FLRA v.

Fulton, </span>615 F.2d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1980) (finding that the Adjutant General was a federal agency with respect to technician employment, and finding further that the fact that "an adjutant general is a state officer does not preclude his simultaneously being a federal agency"); <span class="Italic">Chaudoin v. Atkinson,</span> 494 F.2d 1323, 1329 (3d Cir. 1974) ("there can be no doubt that the Adjutant General of Delaware is an agency or agent of the United States [in administering the technician program]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither of the cases that the Respondent relies upon is persuasive<span class="Italic">. See Ursulich v. Puerto Rico</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>384 F. Supp. 736 (D.P.R. 1974) <span class="Italic">(Ursulich); Melendez v. Puerto Rico National Guard</span>, 70 MSPR 252 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Melendez). </span>The first, <span class="Italic">Ursulich</span>, is inapposite. The case involved a tort action concerning the death of a National Guard member, not a technician. The court ruled that the Guard member was a state employee and that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was the party in interest. 384 F. Supp. at 738. This case sheds no light on whether, in administering federal statutes, and the technician program in particular, the Respondent has the legal status of a federal agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the second decision on which the Respondent relies, <span class="Italic">Melendez, </span>the MSPB held that the Puerto Rico National Guard is not a federal agency and that the adjutant general is not a federal employee. This MSPB decision is inconsistent with long-standing Authority and judicial precedent, discussed above, finding that with respect to technician employment, the state National Guards and their adjutants general are federal entities subject to enforcement of Authority orders. Accordingly, we are not persuaded by <span class="Italic">Melendez.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Air Nat'l Guard, 156th Airlift Wing,</span> decided that FLRA lacked the jurisdiction to direct the reinstatement of a National Guard technician who was removed from the Guard, and then terminated from his associated civilian technician position, as a result of his union activities. The decision of the Adjutant General was unreviewable, 56 FLRA at 181-82:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;Section 709(e) of the Technicians Act Precludes the Authority from Reviewing the Respondent's Retaliatory Termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Judge found that the Respondent terminated a technician for the express and sole reason that he engaged in informational picketing and that this termination violates the Statute. The Respondent does not dispute the facts. Instead, it questions our ability to remedy what would in a non-technician setting be a patent violation of our Statute. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Judge's findings with regard to the termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 709(e)(5) of the Technicians Act provides that "a right of appeal which may exist with respect to [adverse personnel actions] shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned." The Authority has held that review of an adverse personnel action against a technician in a ULP proceeding would violate that provision. <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard,</span> 19 FLRA at 105. In so holding, the Authority relied on court decisions that had reversed the Authority concerning a technician's right to arbitrate adverse actions.[12] <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 103-105 (citing <span class="Italic">New Jersey National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, </span>677 F.2d 276, 282 (3d Cir. 1982), and <span class="Italic">California</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard v. FLRA, </span>697 F.2d 874, 879 (9th Cir. 1983)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;As the dissent points out, the Authority's review of unfair labor practice complaints is different from arbitral review. Nevertheless, with regard to challenging technician terminations, both types of review are prohibited by section 709(e) because only an adjutant general may review such an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See New Jersey Air</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>677 F.2d at 282 (Section 709(e) "establishes only that a dispute over one of the enumerated matters, <span class="Italic">whatever procedural route it may take,</span> must terminate, finally, with the decision of the adjutant general") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard, </span>the Authority recognized, and the D.C. Circuit affirmed, that Congress's intent regarding section 709(e) is clear--"Congress plainly intended to leave with state adjutants general the final authority over adverse personnel actions against National Guard technicians." 19 FLRA at 105. The adjutant general has final authority, Congress has emphasized, "notwithstanding any other provision of law," which includes the Statute.[13] <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 104. As the D.C. Circuit stated in affirming <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard,</span> "the [Statute] evidences no legislative intent to override the clear pre-emptive language of the Technicians Act<span class="Italic">." Illinois Air Chapter 34, ACT, Inc. v. FLRA, </span>No. 851579, at 2 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 23, 1986). Accordingly, the Authority determined that it lacked jurisdiction in ULP proceedings to review a technician's termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;When Congress enacted the Statute in 1979, it was presumably aware of the "notwithstanding any other provision of law" language which it had enacted in the Technicians Act of 1968. However, Congress chose not to address the Technicians Act's limit on review procedures when it drafted the Statute. <span class="Italic">See New Jersey National Guard, </span>677 F.2d at 286 ("It appears inconceivable that Congress in 1978, without a moment's thought as to the question of state control over the National Guard, or as to the needs of military discipline over Guard technicians in their dual status as civilian and military personnel, intended to eliminate, by mere implication, the controls that Congress carefully had imposed over those employees and deemed 'essential' ten years earlier.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's attempt to distinguish the case based on the "important First Amendment rights protected by the Statute" is not persuasive. The Judge cited cases in which federal courts exercised jurisdiction over otherwise nonreviewable personnel actions where constitutional rights were implicated. However, the Authority's jurisdiction in ULP cases extends only to claims arising from the Statute, not constitutional claims. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. King, </span>961 F.2d 240, 243 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that a union's constitutional claim was not adjudicable in the administrative proceeding before the Authority). Here, the Authority has clearly found that the employees have the statutory right to picket. However, it is section 709(e) of the Technicians Act, not the Statute, that restricts the Authority's ability to review an employee's termination for picketing. As such, the constitutional question raised in this case does not provide a basis for adjudication where the Authority is other-wise deprived of jurisdiction to resolve a particular issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel contends that review should lie in at least those cases where the termination is expressly premised on protected activity.&#x2003;Unfortunately, the express and exclusive language of section 709(e) does not permit such an exception, even where--as here--the Respondent's misconduct is flagrant. Notwithstanding the blatant nature of the violation in this case, the wording of section 709(e) deprives us of jurisdiction. We recognize that the National Guard's immunity from prosecution in ULP proceedings for retaliatory discharges of civilian technicians leaves meaningful rights Congress provided technicians under the Statute largely unenforceable. It seems incongruous for Congress to on the one hand provide rights, but on the other to deny any meaningful enforcement. Nevertheless, it is for Congress, not the Authority, to correct this injustice. <span class="Italic">See Pritzker v. Yari, </span>42 F.3d 53, 73 (1st Cir. 1994) (the unambiguous language of a statute may not be ignored, even if its application to particular facts evokes a "sympathetic reaction").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Air Nat'l Guard, 156th Airlift Wing</span>, rejected the argument that FLRA lacked jurisdiction because the matter leading to the complaint--directions to the union concerning the conduct of informational picketing, and actions taken against employees following that picketing--involved matters of military rather than civilian employment. FLRA directed restoration of security clearances and rescission of agency decisions to suspend employees with pay, 56 FLRA 174, 178-80 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Authority Has Jurisdiction To Determine Whether the Order, Surveillance Threat, and Picketing Were Civilian, Rather Than Military in Nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that the case involves a military--as opposed to civilian--controversy and that, therefore, the Authority lacks jurisdiction. Military matters are generally nonjusticiable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wright,</span> 5 F.3d at 590-91. Although the Authority does not have jurisdiction over military matters, it does have jurisdiction over civilian matters that arise under the Statute. Because this case relates to the civilian aspect of technician employment, we conclude that the Authority has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Technicians Have a Dual Status, and the Authority Has Jurisdiction over the Civilian Aspect of Technician Employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that there is both a military and a civilian aspect to technician employment.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., National Federation of Federal Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1669 and U.S. Department of Defense, Arkansas Air</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard, 188th Fighter Wing, Fort Smith,</span> <span class="Italic">Arkansas, 55 </span>FLRA 63, 66-67 (1999) <span class="Italic">(Arkansas Guard)</span> (union proposal regarding technician uniforms relates to civilian aspect of technician employment and, therefore, is within the Guard's duty to bargain), <span class="Italic">enforced sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom.

<p class="noindent-1">The long-standing precedent on this point is supported by both the language [7] and legislative history [8] of the Technicians Act. In addition, the technician's dual status has been recognized by virtually every court and administrative forum to address the issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1623, </span>852 F.2d 1349; <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 182, 186 (1991) <span class="Italic">(Kostan). </span>Further, technicians possess the same rights and privileges as other federal employees, except where specifically and expressly limited by law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1623, </span>852 F.2d at 1350-51 (technicians covered under the Statute); <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, 50 MSPR at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The Technicians Act states that a technician employed under the act "is an employee of the Department of the Army or the <span id="page_1614"></span>Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(d). The Technicians Act not only establishes the civilian character of technician employment, but also reflects Congress's intent that technicians have the same collective bargaining rights as other federal employees. In this regard, subsections 709(f) and (g) exempt technicians from specific provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code, but do not exempt them from the Statute.</p>

News 3318, 3319 (technicians serve both by performing "full-time civilian work" and "military training and duty"). In addition, legislation enacted after the Technicians Act confirms that Congress intended technicians to have the right to bargain collectively like other federal employees. In 1978, Congress enacted what was to become 10 USC &#x00A7; 976 (Pub. L. 95-610), which prohibits collective bargaining in the military. The language and legislative history of that statute demonstrate that Congress knew of and considered the special employment circumstances of civilian technicians and that Congress was committed to collective bargaining rights for civilian technicians. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 95-894(l), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 7575, 7580; H.R. Rep.

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that technician employment is military in character, citing <span class="Italic">Wright, </span>where the First Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">dicta </span>that the military and civilian aspects of technician employment are inseparable. Because the technicians' military and civilian roles are so intertwined, the Respondent contends that the FLRA lacks subject matter jurisdiction even in cases where there are effects on a technician's civilian employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's attempt to merge the civilian and military aspects of technician employment. First, the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Wright </span>is not persuasive. The First Circuit in <span class="Italic">Wright </span>recognizes the dual status of Guard technicians. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 F.3d at 587. Moreover, the court was not asked to determine whether technicians have rights under the Statute. Indeed, the First Circuit has recognized that technicians are covered by the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Granite State Chapter, Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Civilian Technicians v. FLRA, </span>173 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 1999). Second, Congress has specifically provided that National Guard technicians have the right to collectively bargain over the non-military conditions of their employment. <span class="Italic">See </span>32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 and footnote 7, <span class="Italic">supra. </span>Although technician employment takes place in a military environment, the technician is a federal civilian employee who has rights under the Statute. To accommodate this dual nature of technician employment, the Authority determines whether an issue relates to the civilian aspect of that employment--and is, therefore, within the protection of the Statute, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Arkansas</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, </span>55 FLRA at 66-67--or whether the issue relates to the military aspect, which is outside the Statute's coverage, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., South Carolina Guard, </span>28 FLRA at 643.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Order, Surveillance Threat, and Picketing Relate to Civilian Matters, and, Therefore, the Authority Has Jurisdiction to Find a Violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether we have jurisdiction over this case, we must decide whether the underlying controversy relates to the civilian or the military aspect of technician employment. As explained below, each allegation of the complaint relates to the civilian aspect of technician employment, and, accordingly, we have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first two allegations in the complaint, concerning the December 6 "order" and the December 8 surveillance threat, both relate to the civilian aspect of technician employment. Before picketing, the Union distributed a flyer and issued a press release announcing its intention to protest the technicians' working conditions. In response, on December 6, the Respondent, through Romo, directed the Union not to picket on the access road leading to the Respondent's premises. Two days later, Romo warned Romero that picketing employees would be photographed and that they should wear a bag or mask over their heads.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the "order" and the surveillance threat, the actual picketing that occurred in this case related to the civilian, as opposed to the military, aspect of technician employment. Both the subject and the manner of the picketing demonstrate the civilian nature of this case. As the Judge found, the technicians were picketing about civilian matters. The picketing emphasized three grievances, all of which relate to the civilian aspect of technician employment, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the retaliation against two union officials for protected activity, the alleged immoral practices of the Respondent's officials during duty hours, and the Respondent's failure to abide by negotiated agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The manner of the picketing was also civilian.&#x2003;The picketing was conducted when the technicians were on neither civilian nor military duty. Further, the picketing technicians wore civilian clothes, not military uniforms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent relies on 10 USC &#x00A7; 976, which generally bars members of the military from activities associated with collective bargaining, to argue that the picketing was unlawful. However, a military agency may not prohibit civilian employees from engaging in informational picketing on its premises. <span class="Italic">See Fort Benjamin Harrison</span>, 40 FLRA at 566. Here, the technicians were picketing in their civilian capacity. In addition, they were picketing about their working conditions, not the military aspect of their employment. Accordingly, section 976 does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also argues that the picketing violated a "military order." We disagree. First, employees on a military base have the right to picket on agency property, "subject only to restrictions necessary to avoid disruption of the agency's mission." <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison, </span>40 FLRA at 566. Neither Romo nor the Respondent has asserted that the basis for Romo's "order" was that the picketing would be disruptive of agency operations. Indeed, as the Judge found, the actual picketing--which was done with permission--did not disrupt military operations and, therefore, was a lawful activity protected by the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, although the Respondent now refers to this "order" as a military order, it was not issued as a military order. Romo's instruction was not addressed to Romero in his military capacity, but in his capacity as Union president. In this regard, the instruction was clearly directed not only to Romero, but to all employees intending to participate in the picketing. Thus, Romo, viewing this as a labor-relations matter, communicated the instruction through channels appropriate for that non-military context and not through a recognized chain of command. Further, the Respondent has not alleged--and there is no direct evidence to support--that Romo's "order" was passed on to the employees who engaged in the picketing. Indeed, the technicians who testified at the hearing stated that they did not receive an order not to picket on the agency's premises. Finally, the instruction was given in a non-military location, at the Base Community Club, in the evening after duty hours. Romero was indisputably present in an off-duty civilian capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Authority has jurisdiction over this case because the actions involved were civilian, rather than military. Accordingly, we affirm the Judge's findings that the Respondent's instruction and surveillance threat regarding the picketing, as well as certain actions taken in retaliation for the lawful picketing, violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal the FLRA's determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the retaliatory termination in <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Air Nat'l Guard, 156th Airlift Wing and AFGE Local 3936 </span>was affirmed,<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 3936 v. FLRA</span>, 239 F.3d 66, 68-72 (1st Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent Federal Labor Relations Authority ("the Authority") issued a final decision and order holding that the Puerto Rico Air National Guard ("the Guard") committed unfair labor practices in violation of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135 (1994 &#x0026; Supp. 1998)<span class="Italic">. P.R. Air Nat'l Guard 156th Airlift Wing and Am. Fed'n Gov't Employees, Local 3936,</span> 56 FLRA 174 (2000). The Authority further held, however, that the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, 32 USC &#x00A7; 709 (West Supp. 2000) ("Technicians Act"), precluded it from reviewing the Guard's alleged retaliatory termination of a union member. Petitioner American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3926 ("the Union") challenges the ruling as to the retaliatory termination. We affirm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union is the exclusive representative of certain "dual-status" technicians employed by the Guard. These technicians are federal civilian employees who, as a condition of their employment, must become and remain military members of the state National Guard unit in which they are employed. 32 USC &#x00A7; 709.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In late November, 1998, the Union planned to conduct an informational picket concerning working conditions at the Guard. Upon learning of the Union's intention, the Assistant Adjutant General advised Pedro Romero, the local union president, not to picket on the access road leading to the Guard's main gate. The Assistant Adjutant General also warned that the picketing might be photographed and that the picketers should wear bags or Halloween masks to cover their faces. On December 8, 1998, approximately twenty-five off-duty technicians picketed in an area designated by the Guard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following month, the Guard placed the picketing technicians on non-duty status and suspended their security clearances. The Authority's General Counsel initiated an unfair labor practice proceeding against the Guard under section 7116(a)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135 ("the Labor-Management Act") (1994 &#x0026; Supp. 1998). The complaint alleged that the Guard interfered with bargaining unit employees' right to picket by ordering the employees not to engage in picketing on the Guard's property, placing them on non-duty status, and suspending their security clearances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Effective March 9, 1999, the Guard discharged Romero from his military position, then terminated his technician employment because he was no longer a Guard member. In response, the General Counsel amended the complaint to allege that the termination was retaliatory and violated the Labor-Management Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1615"></span>The Guard moved to dismiss the case, contending that the Authority lacks subject matter jurisdiction. The administrative law judge denied the motion. Because the Guard failed to participate in the prehearing discovery required by the Authority's regulations, the General Counsel moved for sanctions. The ALJ granted the motion and prohibited the Guard from introducing evidence, objecting to the General Counsel's evidence, or "raising any particular jurisdictional defense pertaining to a particular remedy." Ultimately, the ALJ held that the Guard had violated the Labor-Management Act as charged by interfering with the technicians' right to picket, and ordered the Guard to rescind the retaliatory personnel actions taken against the technicians, including Romero's termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guard appealed the ALJ's decision to the Authority, which largely affirmed the ALJ. The Authority determined, however, that the ALJ's sanctions could not legally prevent the Authority from addressing issues regarding its jurisdiction. The Authority further held that it was precluded from reviewing Romero's termination because of section 709(f) of the Technicians Act, which gives the state adjutants general (including the adjutant general of Puerto Rico) "final review" of technician terminations. The Union appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Discussion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first consider the frameworks of the two statutes at issue.&#x2003;In 1968, Congress enacted the Technicians Act to "accommodate the civilian interests of [National Guard technicians] without intruding on the Guard's military and security needs, and to recognize by statute the special employee status that had evolved informally," <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 677 F.2d 276, 279 (3rd Cir. 1982). The Act sets forth several conditions of employment concerning the discipline and discharge of Guard technicians that remain within the final discretion of the adjutants general of the state National Guards. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 32 USC &#x00A7; 709(f). It provides, in relevant part: "<span class="Italic">Notwithstanding any other provision of law...</span>a right of appeal which may exist with respect to [separation or discharge from employment] shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned." 32 USC &#x00A7; 709(f) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The other statute at issue is the Labor-Management Act, a comprehensive legislative scheme regulating the organizational rights of federal employees. It "embodies a statutory scheme...for the establishment of a law of labor-management relations for the federal public service analogous to that of the National Labor Relations Act in the private sector." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy v. Fed Labor Relations Auth</span>, 815 F.2d 797, 798 (1st Cir. 1987) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Authority that the plain language of section 709(f)(4) of the Technicians Act categorically precludes review of technician terminations under the Labor-Management Act. A "clearer statement" than the Technicians Act's "notwithstanding any other provision of law" language "is difficult to imagine." <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 283. This "preemptive language is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend any other, more general, legislation, whenever enacted, to qualify the authority of the state adjutants general as set out in the Technicians Act<span class="Italic">." Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority decided this issue squarely in <span class="Italic">Ill. Nat'l Guard and Ill. Air Chapter 34, Ass'n Civilian Technicians, Inc., </span>19 FLRA 101, 105 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd, Ill. Air Chapter 34, Ass'n Civilian Technicians, Inc. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </span>No. 85-1579 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 23, 1986), holding that the Authority could not review in an unfair labor practice proceeding an allegation that a technician had been terminated for exercising rights protected by the Labor-Management Act. The Authority looked to the plain language of section 709, noting that Congress had emphasized that the adjutant general should have final authority over adverse personnel actions against technicians, regardless of what other laws provided. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other circuits have considered the intersection of the Labor-Management Act with the Technicians Act, although not in the specific context of unfair labor practices. In <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, the Third Circuit held that the appeal provision of section 709(f) made it clear that the Guard is not obligated to engage in collective bargaining. This is true, the court held, despite the subsequent enactment of the Labor-Management Act, which sets forth a collective bargaining system for federal employees. 677 F.2d at 280, 285. There is no evidence that Congress intended the general provisions of the Labor-Management Act to repeal or modify the specific reservation of authority set out in section 709(f) of the Technicians Act. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 285. All of the other circuits considering this issue have similarly held that the Technicians Act reserves exclusive review of personnel actions affecting technicians for the state adjutants general. <span class="Italic">Ind. Air Nat'l Guard v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 712 F.2d 1187 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Neb. Military Dep't, Office of Adjutant Gen. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </span>705 F.2d 945 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Cal. Nat'l Guard v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </span>697 F.2d 874 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of the Technicians Act also supports the Authority's conclusion. This history evidences "serious congressional concern with ensuring the final authority of state adjutants general." <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 283. In its report, the Senate Committee on Armed Services stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This bill implements the purpose [of the legislation] by converting the technicians to Federal employee status with certain controls on administration and supervision which would as a matter of law remain at the State level. In effect, the technicians will become Federal employees receiving the salaries, fringe and retirement benefits, but with certain administrative control regarding employment supervision remaining with the adjutants general of the jurisdiction concerned under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S. Rep. No. 90-1446, at 2 (1968). Accordingly, "section 709[(f)], which ensures the authority of the state adjutants general, can be viewed as a virtual <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for the section 709 [(e)] grant of federal employee status." <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l </span>Guard, 677 F.2d at 284.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Labor-Management Act's legislative history "do[es] not provide an affirmative expression of congressional intent to override the specific provision for exclusive review of section 709 [(f)] matters by the state adjutants general in the technicians statute." <span class="Italic">Neb. Military Dep't,</span> 705 F.2d at 951-52; <span class="Italic">see also N.J. Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 285 (no reference to dual-status technicians in the Labor-Management Act's legislative history). While Congress could have altered the Technicians Act's limit on review procedures when it enacted the Labor-Management Act, it did not do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In attempting to evade the finality of section 709(f), the Union contends that this case does not involve an "appeal" within the meaning of that provision. The fact that an unfair labor practice proceeding begins with a "complaint" rather than an "appeal," however, is not a meaningful distinction. As have other courts considering the interaction between the Technicians Act and the Labor-Management Act, we will construe the term "appeal" broadly enough to include procedures that involve the review of terminations but are not technically described as "appeals." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cal. Nat'l Guard</span>, 697 F.2d at 879 (holding that a negotiated grievance procedure effectively constitutes an appeal Within the meaning of section 709(f)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that First Amendment concerns modify the reach of the Technicians Act because Romero was terminated for participating in "protected activity." The protections at issue here are rooted in the Labor-Management Act, however; the Authority's jurisdiction extends only to statutory, not constitutional, claims. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. King, </span>961 F.2d 240, 243 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that a union's constitutional claim was not adjudicable in the administrative proceeding before the Authority). Therefore, there is no independent constitutional basis for petitioner's retaliatory termination claim.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Union correctly points out that when interpreting the Labor-Management Act, the Authority should "consider the constitutional implications of its choice between permissible interpretations of the Statute." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. Fed. Labor Relations</span> <span class="Italic">Auth., </span>986 F.2d 537, 539 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In this case, however, the Authority resolved a threshold jurisdictional issue based on the requirements of law external to the Labor-Management Act. It properly concluded that any constitutional questions raised in this case do not independently establish jurisdiction. Nor does the fact that the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA)--of which the Labor-Management Act is a part--preempts judicial review of the technicians' constitutional claims provide the Authority with jurisdiction. The fact that a court will not hear a claim does not provide an agency with jurisdiction that it otherwise lacks, even if a party is left without a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Roth v. United States,</span> 952 F.2d 611, 615 (1st Cir. 1991) (even though administrative agencies rejected claim for lack of jurisdiction, CSRA preempted court review of that claim).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Technicians Act deprived the Authority of jurisdiction, it could not review Romero's termination, despite the Guard's patent and egregious violations of the Labor-Management Act. We agree with the Authority that this result is unfortunate. As the Authority stated in its majority opinion, however, we cannot rewrite the statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it may lack authority to review discipline of a dual status technician, FLRA determined that the agency committed a ULP by interfering with the union's ability to conduct its investigation into disciplinary charges that would be reviewed by an agency tribunal. The agency improperly directed the union to have no contact with agency employees outside the presence of agency counsel before the initiation of the hearing, <span class="Italic">Michigan Army Nat'l Guard and LIUNA Local 2132</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-56.html">69 FLRA 393</a>, 395-96 (2016) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Michigan Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 878 F.3d 171 (6th Cir. 2017)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although military matters are generally nonjusticiable before the Authority,[19] not all aspects of technician employment are, as the Respondent argues, "irreducibly military in nature." To the contrary, "the technician's dual status has been recognized by virtually every court <span id="page_1616"></span>and administrative forum to address the issue," including the Authority.[21] As the Judge noted in his decision, it is well-settled that "[a]lthough technician employment takes place in a military environment, the technician[s are] federal civilian employee[s] who [have] rights under the Statute." Moreover, the National Guard Technician Act expressly designates technicians as "dual status" civilian and military employees.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, although the Authority does not have jurisdiction over military matters arising out of technician employment, it does have jurisdiction over civilian matters of technician employment that arise under the Statute.[24] To accommodate this dual nature of technician employment, the Authority determines whether an issue relates to the civilian aspect of that employment--and is therefore within the protection of the Statute--or whether the issue relates to the military aspect, which is outside the Statute's coverage.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Respondent claims that this dispute is military in nature because it arises out of an administrative process concerning the discipline of two technicians. The Respondent asserts that "the hearings requested by the...employees in this case...[are] irreducibly military in nature," and that "any conduct that occurred within the context of said hearings" is outside the jurisdiction of the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the ULP charge does not stem from the subject matter of the administrative hearing. Rather, it concerns only the Respondent's directive prohibiting the Union representative from engaging in "[a]ny communications with employees or representatives of the [Respondent] outside the presence of a[&#8197;] [Respondent] attorney." This complete and unqualified ban on communications extends beyond any military aspect of the administrative hearing and into the civilian realm of bargaining-unit employees' employment. For example, this directive would extend to off-duty communications between the Union representative and the two technicians. The Authority has previously held that off-duty activities undertaken by technicians fall within the civilian component of technicians' dual military-civilian status.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The FLRA's Jurisdiction Over the Guard</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guard contends that the FLRA lacks jurisdiction over the Guard because the Guard is not an executive agency under the Statute. Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo. Ammex, Inc. v. United States</span>, 367 F.3d 530, 533 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Econ. Dev. Corp</span>., 241 F.3d 501, 509 (6th Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As background, the Statute is a federal law that establishes collective-bargaining rights for most employees of the federal government. It was established under Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which limited the scope of the FLRA's jurisdiction to "executive agencies." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3). Thus, we start our analysis by addressing whether the Guard is a federal executive agency under the Statute. Our precedent dictates that it is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Michigan Army National Guard</span> [<span class="Italic">FLRA v. Michigan Army National Guard</span>, 878 F.3d 171 (6th Cir. 2017)], the Michigan National Guard challenged the power of the FLRA to assert jurisdiction over it and cited to many of the same cases on which the Guard now relies. We rejected their challenge and held that the Statute "clearly" provides labor rights and protections to dual-status technicians, and that the FLRA has jurisdiction over state national guards and their adjutants general with respect to technician bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 178 (citing <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 286; <span class="Italic">Lipscomb v. FLRA</span>, 333 F.3d 611, 620 (5th Cir. 2003)). We reasoned that "[w]hile each state unit of the National Guard is ‘a state agency, under state authority and control,' the ‘activity, makeup, and function of the Guard is provided for, to a large extent, by federal law.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 177 (citing <span class="Italic">New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 278).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Put differently, in their capacity as employers of dual-status technicians who receive "the benefits and rights generally provided for federal employees in the civil service," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 279), state national guards are executive agencies. Because our precedent dictates that the FLRA has jurisdiction over the Michigan National Guard with respect to labor-relations disputes, it would be unreasonable to suggest that the FLRA does not have jurisdiction over the Ohio National Guard with respect to nearly identical issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Every other circuit that has considered this issue has similarly found that state national guards constitute executive agencies in their capacity as employers and supervisors of technicians. For example, in Lipscomb, 333 F.3d at 616, the Fifth Circuit held that dual-status technicians are employees of an "executive agency" for the purposes of the Statute. In fact, the Guard itself concedes that many circuits have held that "technicians have bargaining rights under the Reform Act, and that state adjutants general or state national guards are therefore subject to the orders of the FLRA." <span class="Italic">See Assoc. of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 230 F.3d 377, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def. v. FLRA</span>, 982 F.2d 577, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">N.Y. Council, Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 505 (2d Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Ind. Air Nat'l Guard v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 1187, 1190 n.3 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Neb. v. FLRA</span>, 705 F.2d 945, 948 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Cal. Nat'l Guard v.

If we accepted the Guard's argument to the contrary, we would create a circuit split. And given the "unanimity of thought" across the circuits on this issue, we are not inclined to do so. <span class="Italic">Terry v. Tyson Farms, Inc</span>., 604 F.3d 272, 279 (6th Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Guard is a federal executive agency in its capacity as the employer of technicians. Thus, the FLRA has jurisdiction over the Guard with respect to labor relations issues under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The FLRA's Jurisdiction Over Dual-Status Technicians</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To issue orders over the Guard with respect to the collective-bargaining disputes at issue here, the FLRA also needs jurisdiction over dual-status technicians. The Guard argues that technicians are members of the uniformed services, and that the Civil Service Reform Act explicitly excludes members of the uniformed services from the FLRA's reach. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(B)(ii). According to the Guard, technicians are members of the uniformed services because they must "wear the uniform appropriate for the member's grade and component of the armed forces." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b)(4). But once again, our decision in <span class="Italic">Michigan Army National Guard</span> forecloses this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Michigan Army National Guard</span>, we held that dual-status national guard technicians are covered by the Statute and are thus afforded certain labor rights. 878 F.3d at 179-80. This includes the right to form, join, and/or assist a labor organization, and the right for labor organizations to engage in collective bargaining with their employing guard over certain labor relations matters related to the civilian aspects of technician employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 181. And because the FLRA is tasked with enforcing these rights, it follows that technicians fall under the FLRA's jurisdiction. Were we to accept the Guard's argument that technicians are not covered under the FLRA's jurisdiction, we would in effect be overturning the ruling of a three-judge panel, an action we are not permitted to take under these circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Lanier</span>, 201 F.3d 842, 846 (6th Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Statutory analysis provides further support for the conclusion that dual-status technicians fall within the FLRA's jurisdiction. The Civil Service Reform Act separates government service into three buckets: the civil service, the armed forces, and the uniformed services. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1). Additionally, the text of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216(a) discusses dual-status military technicians and states that "for purposes of this section and <span class="Italic">any other provisions of the law</span>," dual-status technicians are "federal civilian employees," not uniformed services employees. (Emphasis added.) Because technicians are federal civilian employees, they have collective bargaining rights under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976, which prohibits military unions, also supports this reading. The House Committee specifically rejected the idea that civilian technicians were members of the military. H.R. Rep. No. 95-894(II) at 7 (1978). This legislative history reflects Congress's efforts to ensure that dual-status technicians, in their civilian capacity, have collective bargaining rights that members of the uniformed services do not have.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, for the reasons stated, both the Guard and its technicians fall within the scope of the FLRA's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Guard's Constitutional Arguments</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn next to the Guard's constitutional challenge. We review constitutional questions <span class="Italic">de novo. Ammex</span>, 367 F.3d at 533 (citing <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 241 F.3d at 509.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guard argues that, under the Militia Clause of the Constitution, art. I, &#x00A7; 8, cls. 15-16, Congress's power to govern state national guards (militias) extends only to the part of the militia that is employed in service of the <span id="page_1617"></span>United States. The Guard understands this to mean that "Congress's power to govern the militia applies only to the portion of the militia called into active duty at any one time." (Pet'r Br. 32.) If the state guard has not been called into active duty, argues the Guard, then the Tenth Amendment "reserves to the states" the power to regulate. (<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 33.) This argument fails. It is not unconstitutional for the FLRA to enforce the Statute by issuing orders to state national guards and their adjutants general. Not a single court of appeals has found that the FLRA lacks jurisdiction over dual-status technicians, or their employing agencies, when the labor dispute at hand is related to the civilian aspects of a technician's job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Lipscomb</span>, for example, the Fifth Circuit addressed similar arguments from the Mississippi National Guard. 333 F.3d at 620. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments barred the FLRA from exercising jurisdiction over the Mississippi Guard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 618 n.7. The Fifth Circuit found that, in its capacity as employer of dual-status technicians, the Mississippi Adjutant General and Mississippi National Guard were not acting as state agencies, but instead as federal executive agencies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 618-19. For that reason, the Fifth Circuit held there were no constitutional problems with Congress giving the FLRA jurisdiction over the state guard. The Tenth and Eleventh Amendment issues addressed in <span class="Italic">Lipscomb</span> mirror the Guard's arguments in this case, and we find the Fifth Circuit's reasoning persuasive here. It is not unconstitutional for the FLRA to enforce the Statute by issuing orders to state national guards in their role as employers of technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf. Nat'l Guard Bureau and ACT</span>, 57 FLRA 240, 244 (2001) (bargaining was not precluded over agency changes in the type of positions that employees could fill, thereby reducing their chances of advancement. That the jobs involved National Guard technician positions did not exempt the agency from national consultation rights. The "military aspects" doctrine did not bar bargaining over matters relating to civilian aspects but not the military aspects of their employment. The employees who sought relief were not dual status technicians.</p>
