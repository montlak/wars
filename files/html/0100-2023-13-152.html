<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-151"><span class="space">a.</span> Evidence of Recovery Between Date of Removal and MSPB Decision</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Street v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 335, 341-42 (1984), determined that an AJ may not consider in mitigation of a removal for physical disability to perform job duties post-termination recovery from the underlying physical condition. The reasoning was that the recovery could not have been reasonably foreseen by the agency at the time it selected removal. But evidence of post-termination recovery is relevant and material to the issue of whether the agency action enhances service efficiency. Although the agency was not faulted for taking the removal action, the action was reversed after the appellant presented evidence to the Board of recovery from the condition leading to termination for inability to perform. This result was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 458, 459 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> the appellant was removed on July 24 for failing to meet the physical requirements of the job. A September 26 medical report showed that he was again fit for duty. By an initial decision on November 21, the AJ concluded that removal did not promote service efficiency, although back pay was docked for the period that appellant was unfit for duty. Another case reaching the same result is <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 676, 680-81 (1988), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 70 (1997) ("[P]ost-removal evidence may be considered by the Board in reviewing a charge of medical incapacity, to the extent that it 'sheds light on the circumstances at the time that the agency acted.'"). In cases of recent recovery, the Board scrutinizes the medical evidence to determine whether recovery is truly achieved; if not, removal is sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 617, 621 (1991) (claim of recovery from job stress once the supervisor announced the intent to leave was undermined by the examination of medical evidence concerning the appellant's problems with stress).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM decided to challenge the analysis in <span class="Italic">Street</span> by requesting reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, but the Board declined to abandon its approach, <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 607, 610-13 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its brief in support of its petition for reconsideration, OPM contends that <span class="Italic">Street</span> should be overruled and that the instant case was wrongly decided. In support of its contention, OPM asserts, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the Board erred in admitting into the record evidence pertaining to events that occurred after the agency's removal decision (presumably such "events" are the appellant's recovery and reinstatement) because the Board's adjudicatory authority is limited to review of the agency's decision at the time the removal action was taken. OPM further contends that the proper issue before the Board is whether the agency's removal action at the time it was taken promotes the efficiency of the service and that evidence relating to the issue of the appellant's improved condition is not relevant to this issue. Finally, it contends that the Board's order violated the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, because the agency's removal action was not erroneous or unjustified, as required under that statute, since the appellant was incapable of performing the duties of her <span id="Page_2204"></span>position at the time the agency removed her, and because the appellant was not ready, willing and able to work before the agency reinstated her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fundamental question presented in this appeal is whether the Board is restricted to reviewing the propriety of the agency's decision when made. As detailed below, under the limited factual circumstances where an individual removed for inability to perform recovers during the time in which an appeal is pending before the Board, we find that OPM has set forth no basis upon which to overrule <span class="Italic">Street</span> or to alter the Board's decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that it is well-settled that the Board has <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review authority. The Board has expressly held that it is not in the position of a Court of Appeals but rather is itself an administrative establishment within the Executive Branch "exercising independent quasi-judicial functions." Thus, "it is the Board's decision, not the agency's [decision] that constitutes an 'adjudication'...which must be articulated in a reasoned opinion providing an adequate basis for review by a Court."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has rejected the notion that its scope of review is limited to consideration of the administrative record established before the agency. Under 5 USC 7701(a) and (b), the Board is mandated to conduct a hearing, if requested by the appellant, and to consider, <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, all the relevant evidence presented by both parties, whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as part of the agency's case record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zeiss v. Veterans Administration</span>, 7 MSPB 516, 8 MSPR 15, 17-18 (1981), where the Board held that an appellant in an adverse action based on absence without leave, "as in any other adverse action" may rely upon medical evidence not previously submitted to the agency as a defense to the merits of the agency's action. The Board noted that the agency is not restricted to reliance upon its administrative record, but may cross examine or otherwise rebut an appellant's evidence presented for the first time at a hearing before the Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's review is not limited to the evidence supporting the agency's decision at the time the removal action was taken. Thus, the Board can rely on evidence of subsequent events that sheds light on the circumstances at the time that the agency acted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that "the efficiency of the service" is the "ultimate criterion" for determining both whether any discipline is warranted and whether a particular penalty may be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goode v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 31 MSPR 446, 449 (1986); <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Department of the Interior</span>, 28 MSPR 673, 675 (1985) ("[a]n adverse action promotes the efficiency of the service when the grounds for the action relate to either an employee's ability to accomplish his duties satisfactorily or to some other legitimate government interest"). Thus, evidence relating to the event of the appellant's improved condition and subsequent reinstatement is relevant to the agency's removal action at the time it was taken because such evidence relates to the ultimate criterion, whether removal promotes the efficiency of the service and, therefore, whether removal is appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Street</span>, the Board expressly recognized the broad scope of its <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review authority. <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 MSPR at 341. It further noted its authority to render a final determination on whether an agency action was taken "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board found that the administrative judge properly admitted into the record evidence of the appellant's recovery from disability, "although such evidence came into existence subsequent to the removal action and was not considered by the agency in effecting the removal."... The Board noted that there had been a "unique intervening substantial change in the appellant's physical condition" after decision at the agency level and upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the administrative judge. The Board found such evidence "directly material" to the sole charge on which the appellant was removed; namely, his physical inability to perform, and found that evidence of his recovery "related to the physical condition which formed the basis for his removal."... Thus, although the Board concluded that the agency showed by preponderant evidence that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position at the time he was separated, due to the "unique circumstances of the case," it concluded that the new evidence was of sufficient weight "to be determinative of the outcome."... The Board explicitly found that the agency's action was not, therefore, taken "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly in this case, where the agency showed before the Regional Office that it had reinstated the appellant because she could perform the duties of her Letter Carrier position, the Board considered these events. It again found these events "directly material" to the sole charge on which the appellant was removed, "physical inability to perform" and that her recovery and reinstatement "was related to the physical condition that formed the basis for her removal." <span class="Italic">Morgan v. United States Postal Service</span>, 38 MSPR at 680. Thus, despite the fact that the appellant was physically incapable of performing the essential duties of her position at the time of her removal, her recovery means that the adverse action can no longer be considered to have been "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Street</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> are based upon the Board's broad <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review authority and its authority to determine whether an agency action promotes the efficiency of the service. The Board, as the "last voice" in the Executive Branch, must avoid the manifest absurdity of upholding a removal for physical incapacitation when intervening events show that the appellant is no longer incapacitated and, thus, removal cannot promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both <span class="Italic">Street</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> are limited to the unique circumstances of each case and simply attempt to avoid a manifestly absurd and inefficient result by taking into consideration the fact that an appellant removed for inability to perform has recovered during the pendency of the appeal before the Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of these cases, the fact that the agency could show that at the time it took the action the appellant was incapable of performing his/her duties, is not determinative of the ultimate outcome of the appeal before the Board. Implicit and inherent in the agency's action in effecting the removal actions based upon inability to perform is its necessary conclusion that such inability will be permanent or at least long-enduring. Otherwise the agency could grant the appellant sick leave or leave without pay to afford the appellant an opportunity to recover. Thus, when it is apparent that the appellant's inability to perform is temporary in nature and, in fact, that the appellant has recovered even before the Board can render an initial decision in an appeal, the Board correctly and properly refuses to hold that the agency's removal action is for the efficiency of the service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e note that the Board has held that a removal for physical disability cannot be sustained when the employee diligently obtains and presents new medical evidence showing that he has recovered from the condition that previously prevented him from performing the duties of his position. In <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Army,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 335, 342 (1984), the Board referred to the provision, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), that a removal may be effected "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." It then found that evidence of the recovery of an employee removed for physical disability even when the evidence was obtained and submitted only on appeal, after the employee's removal had been effected was relevant and material to the "efficiency of the service" requirement. <span class="Italic">Street,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 342. Although the Board expressly declined to "impugn the judgment of the agency based on the facts that it knew at the time it effected [the employee's] removal," it concluded that the removal in that case could not be sustained in light of the newly submitted evidence of recovery. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 343; <span class="Italic">see also Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 607, 609-13 (1991) (the employee's removal for physical inability did not meet the "efficiency of the service" standard, and therefore could not be sustained, in light of evidence submitted on appeal, indicating that the employee's condition had improved and that she had been reinstated).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the timing of submission to the Board of evidence of record was noted in <span class="italic">Jones v. USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/JONES_JULIA_HAMILTON_AT_0752_20_0570_I_2_REMAND_ORDER_1996296.pdf">AT-0752-20-0570-I-2</a>, n.3 (NP 1/25/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her petition for review, the appellant has submitted a brief statement from a physician dated August 10, 2021, indicating that she is clear to work but cannot lift over 10 pounds. To the extent the appellant suggests that this statement establishes that she is recovered and thus the agency action must fail, the Board has held that when an appellant recovers from the medical condition that resulted in her removal before the administrative judge has issued an initial decision in her removal appeal, the removal action does not promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="italic">See Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 607, 613 (1991) ("Thus, when it is apparent that the appellant's inability to perform is temporary in nature and, in fact, that the appellant has recovered even before the Board can render an initial decision in an appeal, the Board correctly and properly refuses to hold that the agency's removal action is for the efficiency of the service."). Here, the agency removed the appellant in 2019 and the administrative judge issued the initial decision in July 2021. Thus, the appellant's new medical evidence is from after the initial decision and is not material. <span class="italic">Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980) (finding that the Board generally will not grant a petition for review based on new evidence absent a showing that it is of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unstated in <span class="italic">Jones</span> was why evidence of recovery is material while an appeal is pending before a regional office, but immaterial while the nonfinal decision of the regional office is pending before the Board on PFR. The distinction is a matter of happenstance. An appeal before a regional could be pending for many months; a PFR could be resolved in a few months. And it occurred in <span class="italic">Jones</span>, an adverse action appeal, that the appeal returned to the region on remand to analyze a whistleblowing defense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant claims that he recovered from a disabling condition that led to <span id="Page_2205"></span>adverse action, the proof must be convincing and unequivocal, <span class="Italic">Casillas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 627, 633-34 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified at the hearing and argues on review that as a result of a rehabilitation program, he has fully recovered from his disability and should be allowed to return to work. In his dissent, the Chairman, citing <span class="Italic">Street v. Department</span> of the <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 23 MSPR 335 (1984), and <span class="Italic">Morgan v. United States Postal Service,</span> 48 MSPR 607 (1991), argues that the appellant's removal is not justified in light of his recovery. The Chairman bases this conclusion on a work capacity evaluation of the appellant by the San Antonio Rehabilitation Clinic that, the dissent asserts, establishes that the appellant has completely recovered from his physical disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The work capacity evaluation presented by the appellant does not establish complete recovery, however. The Clinical Director, Alden Lim, who wrote the report, is not a medical doctor, in contrast to the agency physicians who reviewed medical records prepared by the appellant's own physician and concluded that medical restrictions were warranted. Furthermore, Mr. Lim noted that "the critical demands of [the appellant's] job were not confirmed by his employer." Mr. Lim thus admits that his report on the appellant's ability to work was not based on knowledge of the actual physical requirements of the appellant's job. Most importantly, Mr. Lim never concluded that the appellant had fully recovered and was able to perform the duties of his position without any medical restrictions. On the contrary, he stated that he "recommend[ed] a work tolerance screening in order to determine his response to an 8-hour work day before return to work is initiated." Thus, what the appellant's evidence amounts to is a statement from someone who is not a medical doctor to the effect that the appellant might be able to return to work, but that further tests are needed to be sure. This is simply insufficient evidence from which to conclude that the appellant has fully recovered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We emphasize that this case does not present a situation analogous to that in <span class="Italic">Street</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, cited by the dissent. Both those cases involved unambiguous evidence of complete recovery from the physical disabilities that had resulted in each appellant's removal. In <span class="Italic">Street</span>, the appellant's physician unequivocally found that the appellant's health had improved to the point where "he currently has no physical limitations whatsoever and should be able to perform physically in [his former job] easily." 23 MSPR at 340. In <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> the agency found the appellant fit enough to reinstate her to her position three months after her removal. 48 MSPR at 609. The appellant made no such showing in this case, and, indeed, did not even suggest that <span class="Italic">Street</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> had any application to his case. In his petition for review, the appellant claims only that the Lim report shows that he has overcome "the vast majority" of the restrictions that resulted in his removal; he does not assert complete physical recovery.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morgan</span> appears to be limited to cases involving separation for physical inability to perform job functions, <span class="Italic">Bal v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-15-0442-I-1 (NP 9/12/2016) (involving charges of improper coding of time sheets and AWOL) (remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Bal v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 729 Fed. Appx. 923 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP) (Judge Mayer dissenting)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge failed to consider his argument that he "got better" and that, pursuant to Board precedent, specifically, <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 607 (1991), his removal should not be sustained. The appellant's argument is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the Board held that a removal for physical inability to perform the functions of a position cannot be sustained when the appellant diligently obtains and presents new medical evidence showing that she has recovered from the condition that previously prevented her from performing the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. at 611-13. The Board reasoned that, under such circumstances, the adverse action can no longer be considered to have been "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. at 612. The holding in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, however, is confined to the charge of inability to perform, which is not a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. at 612-13. We therefore find that it is inapplicable to the instant case, which is based on two charges of misconduct....</p>

Moreover, the appellant provides no medical evidence that would indicate that she has recovered from the medical condition for which Dr. Warren declared her 'permanently and totally disabled.'
