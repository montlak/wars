<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-179"><span class="space">4.</span> Furlough; RIF</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A furlough of less than 30 days is imposed against an ALJ in accordance with a complaint filed by the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ. v. Cook</span>, 46 MSPR 162, 163 (1990) (determining that "good cause exists for the proposed furlough because 'it is directly related to a management plight caused by financial restrictions.'"). A furlough of more than 30 calendar days, defined also by (the late) FPM to include 22 workdays when the furlough is not served on consecutive days, is imposed under reduction in force procedures. An ALJ does not obtain a preaction hearing when he desires to challenge a RIF. <span class="Italic">Clerman v. ICC</span>, 35 MSPR 190, 192-95 (1987), explained both the proper procedures governing RIFs of ALJs and the distinction between short and long-term furloughs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2) provides that an agency should follow reduction-in-force procedures whenever it "releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by furlough for more that 30 days...." The reduction-in-force regulations define "days" as calendar days. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203. OPM has further interpreted 30 calendar days to mean 22 work days whenever the furlough was not to be served on consecutive days. Federal Personnel Manual Bulletin No. 351-32, Para. 6(a)(1), P. 2, issued Dec. 4, 1981 and expired Jan. 20, 1983; and OPM bulletin FEDFACTS-24. Since a 30 calendar day period generally contains 22 work days, the obvious intent of these OPM interpretations was to extend the protections of Part 351 to any furlough served on intermittent days which was the functional equivalent of a covered furlough served on consecutive days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 351 generally provides veterans, employees who have seniority, and employees who have good performance ratings with rights in the event of a reduction-in-force which they would not have if they were subjected <span id="Page_2276"></span>to an adverse action. Therefore, while an employee can be subjected to a sustainable short-term furlough, as an adverse action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512, if the agency establishes that the furlough was in the interests of the efficiency of the service, the same employee cannot be subjected to a sustainable long-term furlough, under Part 351's reduction-in-force procedures, unless the agency establishes that it is also releasing all competing employees who are in a lower tenure group or who have a later service computation date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Administrative law judges have greater adverse action rights than other federal employees since they are entitled to a hearing before the Board prior to the effectuation of the action at which the agency must establish good cause for the proposed action. Therefore, if the determination in the initial decision is correct and the agency's furlough in this case should properly have been classified as an adverse action rather than as a reduction-in-force, the agency's action would have had to have been preceded by a Board hearing in order to have accorded these appellants with their greater adverse action rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the determination in the initial decision was not correct. The initial decision should have concluded that the consistent interpretations given by OPM to its own reduction-in-force regulations were entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Fed. Elec. Comn v. Dem. Senatorial</span> <span class="Italic">Campaign Com.,</span> 454 U.S. 27, 36-43, 102 S. Ct. 38, 44-47, 70 L. Ed.2d 23 (1981). This is particularly true since the Board had previously adopted the position put forward herein by OPM in a case involving a suspension imposed on intermittent days. In <span class="Italic">Klimek v. Department of Army</span>, 3 MSPB 248, 3 MSPR 139 (1980), the Board held, for the purposes of determining adverse action appeal rights, that the length of an action imposed on intermittent days should be judged by the number of work days which generally would be included in an action of the same number of calendar days. Thus, in that case, the Board concluded that the suspension imposed on 14 non-consecutive days had to be regarded as the equivalent of a suspension of more that 14 calendar days and was, therefore, an appealable adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the fact that Congress has provided these appellants, in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521, with greater adverse action protections than other federal employees does not justify adopting a special rule for determining the length of reductions-in-force involving administrative law judges. Congress provided administrative law judges with additional protections in order to insulate them from agency actions that could interfere with their qualified right of judicial independence. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman,</span> 28 MSPR 120 (1985). The Supreme Court has specifically held that Congress did not, however, extend added protections for administrative law judges in reduction-in-force situations and that, for the purposes of reductions-in-force, administrative law judges were to be treated in the same fashion as all other federal employees. Therefore, in <span class="Italic">Ramspeck v. Federal Trial Examiners Conference,</span> 345 U.S. 128, 73 S. Ct. 570, 97 L. Ed. 872 (1953), the Court rejected the contention that civil service reduction-in-force procedures could not lawfully be applied to administrative law judges. It concluded, instead, that, under the protective scheme created by Congress, any agency attempt to improperly utilize those procedures to interfere with the qualified right to judicial independence of administrative law judges would be adequately protected against through reduction-in-force appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because OPM lawfully requires Part 351 procedures to be utilized whenever covered federal employees are furloughed for more than 22 work days and because administrative law judges are treated for reduction-in-force purposes in the same manner as other federal employees, the actions in this case were properly processed under Part 351 procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the actions should have been sustained. The agency established that the reduction-in-force regulations were invoked in order to cope with a budgetary crisis and that Part 351 procedures were properly applied in an across-the-board fashion to all of its employees. The appellants presented no evidence to challenge the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the agency's reason for taking the challenged actions nor did they raise any non-jurisdictional argument that the applicable regulations had been misapplied. Therefore, the initial decision should have concluded that the agency met its burden of proof concerning these actions. <span class="Italic">See Aronson v. Department of Navy</span>, 4 MSPB 379, 4 MSPR 310 (1980) and <span class="Italic">Losure v. ICC</span>, 2 MSPB 361, 2 MSPR 195 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case presents an additional issue which needs to be addressed. The agency anticipated that the furloughs would be served at the rate of one day per week. However, because its budgetary problems were resolved more rapidly than the agency expected, the actual length of the intermittent furloughs was only 8 work days. Given these appellants' statutory entitlement to a hearing before a short-term furlough could lawfully be imposed, this difference raises a question as to whether the length of the furlough should be judged by its anticipated or by its actual length for the purpose of classifying the agency action as a short-term or a long-term furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not had any occasion to rule upon this particular issue. We note that unless an agency is in the unusual position of knowing in advance exactly how long a budgetary crisis will last, it will be forced, as was the agency herein, to estimate the length of the crisis in order to determine which procedural rights it should afford to its employees. Moreover, it would appear to be unfair for this Board to utilize the advantages of hindsight in judging the appropriateness of such an agency determination. Therefore, absent a showing of bad faith, the Board will not overturn an agency action because it incorrectly estimated the necessary length of a furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in that regard is consistent with relevant Board case law. Agencies are required to establish that they properly invoked reduction-in-force regulations for appropriate management reasons<span class="Italic">. Medina-Rodriquez v. Veterans Administration,</span> 21 MSPR 679 (1984). They are not required to establish the correctness of their judgments and once they establish that reduction-in-force regulations were invoked for appropriate reasons, the Board will not then review the management considerations underlying the exercise of that agency discretion. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 2 MSPB 335, 2 MSPR 168 (1980). Therefore, the Board has declined to invalidate the release of employees, due to decreases in personnel ceilings, even though the agencies may have subsequently received increases in their staffing levels which made the earlier reductions-in-force unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Veterans Administration</span>, 4 MSPB 383, 4 MSPR 315 (1980). Instead, the appropriateness of the agency decisions to release these employees, because of staffing limitations, was judged on the basis of the agency's ceilings when the actions were taken and not on events which occurred after the fact. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Veterans Administration,</span> 4 MSPB 398, 4 MSPR 333 (1980).</p>

Palmer</span>, 68 MSPR 586, 589 (1995) (furlough complaints resulting from a threat of budgetary shortfalls were moot once the threat of an appropriations lapse passed; although there was the possibility of a future budgetary shortfall, a resulting furlough would not evade review since an adversely affected ALJ could file an appeal if she was furloughed without prior Board authorization due to a funding lapse).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate actions against ALJs. An agency may take an action against an ALJ only for "good cause" as determined after a hearing by the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a). The petitioner must prove good cause by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision's test fails to recognize that not all furloughs are a result of a shortage of funds. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5)[2] ("furlough" means "the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds or other nondisciplinary reasons"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 (same). If, hypothetically, the petitioner experienced a drastic reduction in the respondents' workload but not in the workload in other parts of the agency, the petitioner would be unable under the initial decision's formulation to establish good cause to furlough its ALJs. This is because the petitioner would be unable to prove that its action was a "management plight related to financial restrictions," and it would be unable to prove that it treated its ALJs the same as it treated employees in other parts of the agency who were not affected by a reduction in the ALJs' workload.[3] We reject the initial decision's four-prong test and reaffirm that the definition of "good cause" is flexible and depends on the individual circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">See Brennan</span>, 787 F.2d at 1561-62; <span class="Italic">Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 467-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Even though "good cause" is not the equivalent of the efficiency of the service standard applicable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in chapter 75 actions against non-ALJ civil servants, the Board finds cases under chapter 75 to be appropriate guidance in adjudicating actions against ALJs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To meet the administrative law judge's disparate treatment <span id="Page_2277"></span>standard under these circumstances, the petitioner would have to furlough employees elsewhere in order to justify furloughing ALJs. If, however, the petitioner did this, it is difficult to imagine how it could show that furloughing one set of employees solely for the purpose of reaching the ALJs promoted the efficiency of the service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the administrative law judge erred by requiring the petitioner to prove, as part of its case-in-chief, that it did not engage in disparate treatment toward the ALJs. This is problematic for two reasons. First, it requires the petitioner to prove a negative, which the Board has acknowledged is usually impracticable. <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 416 (1981). Second, it ignores the possibility of circumstances in which there is good cause for treating ALJs differently from other classes of employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In requiring the petitioner to prove the absence of disparate treatment, the administrative law judge relied on two Board cases, <span class="Italic">Department of Education v. Cook</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 162 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Federal Drug Administration v. Davidson</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 223 (1990). Neither case supports the administrative law judge's conclusion because neither <span class="Italic">Cook</span> nor <span class="Italic">Davidson</span> held that an agency must prove that it treated ALJs the same as other agency employees. Rather, <span class="Italic">Davidson</span> noted, as one consideration among several, that there was no evidence that ALJs were being treated differently. <span class="Italic">Davidson</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 226. <span class="Italic">Cook</span> mentioned disparate treatment in a background statement reciting the parties' arguments, not in any Board finding. <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 163.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, because it relies on the purported "special status" of ALJs,[4] the initial decision could be deemed to imply that ALJs are entitled to greater protection than non-ALJ employees in a furlough situation. An agency may furlough ALJs under &#x00A7; 7521 for precisely the same reasons that it may furlough any other category of employee under &#x00A7; 7513. Actions against ALJs involve a different standard for action, and they involve additional procedural protections in that the petitioner has to obtain authorization from the Board before acting. Also, whatever the reason for the action, it cannot be for a reason that interferes with the ALJs' qualified judicial independence. However, ALJs are not a "protected class," and they have no entitlement to receive favorable substantive treatment in a furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> ID at 32 ("...I must determine whether this plan nevertheless appropriately considered the special status of [ALJs] ...."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> ID at 34 ("The evidence in the record tends to show that the [petitioner] did not recognize its limitations related to the compensation and tenure of its ALJs."); ID at 36 ("If an agency employs [ALJs] ...then under existing law the [petitioner] must consider that ALJs have special protections and accept that the existence of a financial plight does not give it unbridled discretion to furlough them.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Requiring the petitioner to treat ALJs the same as other employees necessarily limits the petitioner's discretion to decide how to allocate its funding because it will, in many circumstances, require the Board to consider whether an agency's choices about how to absorb budget shortfalls are appropriate. We have held in the context of a reduction in force that an agency has broad management discretion to take action to avoid a budget deficit. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 566, 570 (1994). We find that the same is true in the context of a furlough. The Board will not scrutinize an agency's decision to determine whether the agency has structured a furlough in a manner that second-guesses the agency's assessment of its mission requirements and priorities. The Board lacks the expertise to review every agency spending decision to determine whether it was wise or whether a particular choice should have been foregone in order to save funds necessary to avoid furloughs. <span class="Italic">See Chandler v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 2013 MSPB 74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of this is to say that evidence of how the petitioner treated other similarly-situated employees is irrelevant. Disparate treatment is certainly a valid consideration and must be part of the good-cause calculus. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6 (2010) (in a chapter 75 case brought under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, when an employee raises an allegation of disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by preponderant evidence before the penalty can be upheld). Evidence of disparate treatment without justification would weigh against a finding of good cause but it does not alone establish the absence of good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the administrative law judge's decision to reduce the length of the proposed furlough in order to bring it in line with the hypothetical average employee in OSec improperly intruded on the petitioner's broad discretion to structure its furlough. In deciding that the ALJs should receive the same number of furlough days as other employees, the administrative law judge substituted his judgment for that of the petitioner as to where the petitioner could cut spending while performing its mission as it deemed appropriate. Moreover, the initial decision authorizes the petitioner to furlough the respondents for the <span class="Italic">average</span> number of days of furlough per OSec employee. This does not achieve the stated objective of ensuring that employees are treated the same because it remains true that some OSec employees will serve more furlough days than others, and some will serve no furlough days at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the petitioner has shown by preponderant evidence that it had sound business reasons behind its decision to furlough OALJ employees, including the respondents. There is no evidence that the decision was made for an improper reason or to interfere with the ALJs' qualified judicial independence. We further find that the arguments that the respondents proffer on review are unpersuasive. In particular, we find that the respondents have not established that the administrative law judge's discovery ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we find good cause shown under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, and authorize the petitioner to furlough the respondents for 5.5 days.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board here adhered to its longstanding view that "good cause" should be defined in a case-by-case manner. <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 6 (citing <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin. v. Long,</span> 2010 M.S.P.B. 19 &#x00B6; 13); <span class="Italic">see also Soc. Sec. Admin. v. Mills</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 463, 467-68 (M.S.P.B. 1996); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec.

The Board reiterated its position that "disparate treatment" of ALJs "must be part of the good-cause calculus." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see Fed. Drug Admin. v. Davidson</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 223, 226 (M.S.P.B. 1990) ("[A]bsent any showing of disparate treatment with other [agency] employees, we will not interfere with the agency's management determination respecting how to structure the furlough."). Finally, the Board applied the "good cause" requirement by asking if the agency had "sound business reasons" for its adopted furlough. <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> &#x00B6; 13. That focus mirrors what the Board has said about non-ALJ furloughs under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See Chandler v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 2013 M.S.P.B. 74 &#x00B6; 8 (an agency satisfies the standard for a furlough under &#x00A7; 7513 "by showing, in general, that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and that the agency applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a 'fair and even manner,'" quoting <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 24 M.S.P.R. 224, 225 (M.S.P.B. 1984)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find nothing improper in the Board's adherence to those principles. The Board could reasonably proceed by case-by-case adjudication in applying the broad and context-dependent "good cause" standard to the wide variety of circumstances that may arise. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co</span>., 416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974) (citing <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp</span>., 332 U.S. 194, 202-03 (1947)). And the Board reasonably interpreted "good cause" in this context to focus on whether the Department had sound business reasons for the challenged furlough and, relatedly, whether the furlough resulted from disparate treatment of ALJs or from a reason inconsistent with decision-making independence. We see no basis in the statute or in the record of this case for reversing the Board's conclusion that those standards suffice to respect ALJs' "special status." <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding what the "good cause" standard requires for ALJs in the context of a furlough of less than 30 days under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, the Board referred to its precedents interpreting (a) the standards for a furlough longer than 30 days applicable in a reduction-in-force proceeding under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3502 and (b) the standards for a furlough of non-ALJ employees under the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span> &#x00B6; 10 (citing <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 60 M.S.P.R. 566, 570 (M.S.P.B. 1994); <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 2013 M.S.P.B. 74 &#x00B6; 9). The Board made clear, however, that it considered its interpretation of those standards as informing, but not controlling, its interpretation of the "good cause" standard of &#x00A7; 7521. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After all, the provisions, though related, are <span id="Page_2278"></span>distinct in language and procedures. We have no need to explore the significance of the distinctions here. The Board interpreted "good cause" in &#x00A7; 7521 to embody the standards we have described, and we hold that interpretation to be reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have no basis for reversing the Board's conclusion that the challenged furloughs in this case met those standards. The ALJs do not argue that the Department lacked good cause to furlough them for some period. Instead, they argue that the Board abused its discretion, and lacked substantial-evidence support, in finding that the Department had good cause to furlough them for 5.5 days. The crux of their protest is that the Department had no good cause for imposing longer furloughs on them than on many other employees outside the Adjudication subaccount. But the Board had ample grounds to conclude that the Department had good cause for its decisions that produced that result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A difference in furlough lengths alone does not constitute an improper outcome under the good-cause standard. The reason for the durational difference matters. Here, no evidence exists that the difference resulted from any determination that relied on ALJ status to impose a longer furlough, let alone a determination aimed at or causing an impairment of decision-making independence. <span class="Italic">See Brennan</span>, 787 F.2d at 1563 (agency actions "based on reasons which interfere with the quasi-judicial functions" of ALJs cannot stand); <span class="Italic">cf. Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins</span>, 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993) ("Whatever the employer's decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome."). Where there is no such evidence, there is no "disparate treatment" or other impropriety when different furloughs are simply the result of following neutral, sound "business reasons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That is the situation here. The Department was under tight constraints in carrying out the required budget sequester. By order (in compliance with statutory requirements), the Department had to cut five percent in spending from the Management Salaries and Expenses account by the end of fiscal year 2013. The Department then made a neutral determination that it would apply that percentage equally to each subaccount (program, project, or activity) within the account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That determination was a reasonable one. Indeed, it was required by 2 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 906(k)(2), which states that, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided, the same percentage sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account." The provision further clarifies, as relevant here, that the "programs, projects, and activities" are the ones "delineated in the appropriation Act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that account." 2 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 906(k)(2). For the Department of Labor, the 2013 appropriation acts carry forward the appropriations from the 2012 act. Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, Pub. L. No. 112-175, &#x00A7; 101, 126 Stat. 1313, 1313 (2012); Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, Pub. L. No. 113-6, &#x00A7; 1101, 127 Stat. 198, 412. The relevant portion of the 2012 act covers the Management Salaries and Expenses account, but does not itself delineate the Adjudication subaccount. <span class="Italic">See</span> Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, 125 Stat. 786, 1061. But the accompanying budget report--to which &#x00A7; 906(k)(2) points in such circumstances--identifies all nine of the subaccounts the Department used for its sequester planning, including Adjudication. H.R. Rep. No. 112-331, at 1173 (2011) (Conf. Rep.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps the Department of Labor, after making the required cuts, had some discretion "to realign funds to protect mission priorities," as OMB suggested "may" be true for "some agencies." Even if that was so, however, the Department could reasonably decide not to offset the cuts here by shifting funds from another departmental function to the Office of ALJs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board concluded, there is no statutory or other basis for forcing the Department to give the ALJ function priority over other departmental functions. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span> &#x00B6; 10 ("The Board will not scrutinize an agency's decision...in a manner that second-guesses the agency's assessment of its mission requirements and priorities."). Moreover, the ALJs cannot claim that shifting funds to their Office was required by an established departmental practice. The only fund-shifting practice identified here was limited to allowing an organizational unit that controlled multiple subaccounts to shift funds from one to another in some circumstances. But there is no evidence that the Office of ALJs, which is itself an organizational unit within the Department, controlled multiple subaccounts, let alone subaccounts it could tap to reallocate funds that would have increased the Office's resources and thereby shortened furloughs. There was no evidence of a departmental practice to allow fund shifting in circumstances relevant to the ALJs' complaint here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the five-percent cut to the Adjudication subaccount produced the challenged length of ALJ furloughs after one further step, namely, equal allocation among the organizational units funded from the Adjudication subaccount--a step that the ALJs do not challenge (their furloughs being generally similar to or shorter than furloughs imposed on others within the various Adjudication units). It is undisputed that a high share of the ALJ Office's budget is tied to non-discretionary spending and salaries, so that employee salaries for that Office had to bear a higher portion of the five-percent cut than in organizational units funded from subaccounts with a greater share of non-salary, discretionary spending. And it is undisputed that following this neutral method produced the 5.5-day furlough for the ALJs before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There was likewise no abuse in the Board's upholding of Judge Jordan's refusal to allow testimony by current ALJs about their perceptions of how their work affects the Department's core mission and how public opinion of the ALJs' judicial independence might be altered by a furlough. Testimony about the importance of ALJ activities to the Department's missions is, at a minimum, hardly needed; there is no dispute about that issue, and such testimony would not compel the Board to second-guess the Department's decision about how to treat its multiple missions. Moreover, general opinion testimony about the effect of furloughs on public opinion of ALJs' judicial independence can readily be rejected as simply too speculative. The exclusion of such testimony also has not been shown to be harmful under the standards for assessing good cause that the Board adopted and that we have upheld.</p>

Davidson</span>, 46 MSPR 223, 226 (1990), the respondent ALJ argued that a furlough was improper because he was on a reimbursable detail, so the agency would not save money by placing him on furlough, i.e., there was no good cause for the proposed furlough. The Board disagreed: the possibility that the ALJ could be on detail during the time of his furlough was speculative and that furloughs "should be based on the current situation and not on events that might occur in the future."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Rutberg v. OSHRC</span>, 78 MSPR 130, 134-36 (1998), the ALJ appealed from a RIF (not imposed, as in a furlough, as an adverse action through a complaint from the employing agency). The Board applied interim relief provisions [discussed in Chapter 5 under "<a href="0100-2023-12-077.html#sec5-77">Interim Relief</a>"] to an ALJ's appeal from separation by RIF that was reversed by the ALJ as a reprisal for whistleblowing disclosures. The Board ultimately reversed the finding of reprisal and sustained the separation. [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-006.html#sec10-7">Furlough</a>" for furloughs involving employees other than ALJs.]</p>
