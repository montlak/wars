<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-357"><span class="space">f.</span> Improper Appointment Authority</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency uses selection procedures or sources that improperly exclude the crediting or consideration of veterans preference during the selection process, the agency may have violated VEOA, as in <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. VA</span>, 92 MSPR 565 (2002), involving the agency's use of an excepted service appointment procedure that precluded application of competitive service procedures requiring consideration of veterans preference. <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen</span> referenced <span class="Italic">Augustine v. VA</span>, 88 MSPR 407 (2001), discussed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, a decision that went into more detail concerning the Outstanding Scholar Program, a consent decree that essentially invalidated a standardized examination for civil service position, and other aspects of the appointment process. Under <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen</span>, at 570-571:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven if the positions were covered by the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree, the record does not show that the agency's use of the Outstanding Scholar program in this case was consistent with OPM's requirement that the program be invoked "as a supplement to the competitive examining process where the under-representation of Blacks and Hispanics exists." <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 2.8(A); <span class="Italic">see Augustine,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 407 &#x00B6; 18. As mentioned previously, the record does not indicate that the agency conducted a competitive examination before selecting the four individuals to fill the vacancies at issue in this case. If it had, preference eligible candidates who would have taken and passed the competitive examination presumably would have been afforded their veterans' preference rights, at least with respect to the positions filled through the competitive examining process. Furthermore, the record contains no evidence to support the proposition that the agency invoked the Outstanding Scholar appointing authority in this case to ameliorate "under-representation of Blacks and Hispanics." <span class="Italic">See Augustine,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 407 &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the three selectees who were not included on the VRA memoranda, the agency has not identified any authority, other than the Outstanding Scholar program, that would have allowed these candidates to be appointed to the positions for which they were selected without passing an examination. Therefore, if the agency was not authorized to use the Outstanding Scholar hiring authority in this case, it could not have properly hired these candidates without conducting an examination. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) ("An individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title."). In addition, because at least 36 applicants applied for the four vacancies, it appears that any examination the agency may have administered should have been an open, competitive examination in which the appellant and other preference eligible candidates would have had the opportunity to compete with the selected candidates. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(1). Following such an examination, the agency would have been required to augment the ratings of any preference eligible candidates who passed the examination by the appropriate number of veterans' preference points. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309. In addition, if the appellant had taken and passed the examination, his name would have been entered ahead of the names of any of the candidates who were not disabled veterans with a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and the agency would have had to obtain OPM's approval to pass over the appellant to select any of the candidates it actually selected who did not qualify for a non-competitive appointment under some other statutory or regulatory authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3313(2), 3318(a), (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the agency's use of the Outstanding Scholar hiring authority essentially precluded the appellant from exercising any veterans' preference rights he may have had in relation to the Outstanding Scholar candidates. Because the record, as it currently stands, does not establish that the agency was properly authorized to use the Outstanding Scholar program when it filled the vacancies at issue in this appeal, we ORDER the agency to show cause why the Board should not find that the agency's use of the Outstanding Scholar hiring authority violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights by allowing the agency to appoint non-preference eligible candidates without affording the appellant the opportunity to compete against these candidates and exercise the veterans' preference rights he would have been afforded in a competitive examining process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency improperly declined to permit initial consideration of an applicant with veterans preference when it instead first considered (and selected from) two applicants referred to the selecting official with priority consideration rights that resulted from a prior erroneous processing of the applications of those two individuals for selection under a prior vacancy announcement. Priority consideration required by agency practice could not displace consideration of an otherwise proper application from a person with veterans preference, <span class="Italic">Shapley v. DHS</span>, 110 MSPR 31, 34-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-18, 2008 MSPB 212 (2008) (overruled as to VEOA right to compete claim for merit promotion positions sought by federal employees, <span class="Italic">Oram v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 30 (2022)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A violation of the opportunity to compete guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) is redressable under VEOA. <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 12. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) provides that "[p]reference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." Thus, under the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), all covered individuals, including current employees and those seeking initial federal appointments, must be permitted to compete when applications will be accepted from persons outside the hiring agency's work force. <span class="Italic">Styslinger v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 32 (2007); <span class="Italic">Jolley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 20 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the vacancy announcement for the Bridge Program Administrator position explicitly states that the position is "[o]pen to all U.S. citizens and under merit promotion procedures to all competitive status candidates, reinstatement eligibles, VEOA eligibles, and those eligible for special appointing or noncompetitive appointment authorities such as 30% or more compensably disabled veterans and persons with disabilities." A vacancy announcement that is open to individuals outside the agency's hiring workforce, as this announcement was, must be filled following 5 U.S.C. chapter 33 hiring requirements. Thus, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), the appellant, as a covered individual, was entitled to the opportunity to compete.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At issue is whether the appellant was provided a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete by having his application for the position considered. It is undisputed that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) placed the appellant's name on the certificate of eligibles for both the merit promotion and open competitive examination processes. However, it is also undisputed that the selecting official was not provided with either of those certificates of eligibles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, Capt. Wayne A. Muilenburg, the selecting official, provided a signed, written statement that was "true and correct to the best of [his] knowledge" stating that Sandy Davis-Johnson, the agency's civilian personnel liaison, advised him after the vacancy announcement closed for the Bridge Program Administrator position that, as a result of the irregularity in the filling of the Supervisory Bridge Management Specialist position, the agency had awarded priority consideration to Ms. Elgaaly and Mr. Helfinstine, who had applied for this position. According to Capt. Muilenburg, he was advised by Ms. Davis-Johnson that, although priority consideration did not require him to select one of these two individuals, he was required to consider their applications before all others and that, "if [he] decided not to hire them [he] needed to be able to articulate specific reasons why [he] made that choice." Capt. Muilenburg objected to this because he could not determine whether there was a stronger candidate available, but he was advised that he could not review the certificate of eligibles prior to going through the process with the two priority status candidates....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Capt. Muilenburg admits that he did not consider the appellant for the position because he was not provided with the appellant's application packet. As a result, the appellant was excluded from competing for a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> vacancy in a situation where the agency was accepting applications from outside its workforce. Moreover, the agency concedes that the appellant was on the certificates of eligibles for both open competitive and merit promotion applicants, and the record shows that the appellant <span id="Page_658"></span>was qualified and at the top of the list of the competitive certificate of eligibles with a rating of 100 points. The agency also concedes that the only reason the appellant's application was not forwarded to Capt. Muilenburg was because Ms. Elgaaly and Mr. Helfinstine were accorded priority consideration. We find that the agency's action of not providing the appellant's application packet to Capt. Muilenburg for the Bridge Program Administrator position violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) because the agency did not provide the appellant an opportunity to compete for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ relied upon <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6; 11 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007), to find that an agency has discretion to fill a vacancy "by any authorized method," and to find that the agency may use merit promotion procedures for evaluating and selecting internal candidates, as well as competitive examination for selecting external candidates. Generally, this is a correct statement of the law because merit promotion procedures constitute an authorized method for evaluating and selecting from among internal candidates, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103, and competitive examination is an authorized method for evaluating and selecting from among external candidates, <span class="Italic">see generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3302, 3304, 3309-3318. However, even though an agency has the discretion to fill a vacancy "by any authorized method," the agency must not violate an individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, like 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also relied upon <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 52 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 88 (2001), <span class="Italic">rev'd sub nom. Meeker v</span>. <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003), and <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 40 (2003), to find that the agency properly granted Ms. Elgaaly and Mr. Helfinstine priority consideration for the position of Bridge Program Administration under merit promotion procedures because they were denied consideration for a position for which they were qualified. Although, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Azdell</span>, priority consideration for future vacancies may generally be the proper remedy for an individual who was denied consideration for a position for which he was qualified due to an invalid employment practice, we have found no statutory authority that provides for the use of priority consideration as a means to exclude from competition a preference eligible or qualified veteran entitled to the rights set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). In any event, the Board in <span class="Italic">Azdell</span> had no occasion to address the impact of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and VEOA on a situation where priority consideration was at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our decision in this case, we recognize that agencies validly use priority consideration under various circumstances, and an individual's entitlement to it can come from a variety of sources. For example, when an employee fully recovers from an injury after more than one year from the date of commencement of compensation, the employing agency must make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Welby v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 13 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). In another context, when a removal action is mitigated by the Board to a demotion, the agency must provide notice of vacant higher-graded positions and give the employee priority consideration for any higher-graded positions for which he is qualified and which the agency elects to fill in those instances where the position on reinstatement is less than the highest graded position to which he would be entitled under the Board's final order. <span class="Italic">Gutkowski v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 399, &#x00B6; 15 (2006); <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 658, 662-63 (1997). In still another context, an applicant who is improperly rated ineligible for a particular position may be entitled to priority consideration for future vacancies. <span class="Italic">Baxter v</span>. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 125, 133 (1990). Priority consideration is also a concept frequently used in settlement agreements which the Board enforces. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Outlaw v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 12-13 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency, relying on "Coast Guard practice," determined that the two individuals who were improperly excluded from consideration for the earlier-advertised position were entitled to priority consideration. The agency argued before the AJ that it relied on OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (May 2007) in determining that those two individuals had to be ranked ahead of all 10-point preference eligibles with a service-connected disability of 10% or more. The agency further argued that the Handbook, which provides guidance to federal agencies, is the type of publication of which the Board should take administrative notice. As set forth above, priority consideration has its place in agency hiring and other personnel decisions. However, the agency used priority consideration in this case to exclude the appellant from consideration, based only on OPM guidance. That guidance, as set out in the Handbook, is subject to, and may not override, applicable laws in Title 5, U.S. Code, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f). <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 35 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006). The agency's decision cannot be sustained when challenged in a VEOA appeal by a preference eligible like the appellant because it denies him the statutory opportunity to compete guaranteed to him by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency's failure to consider the appellant for the position of Bridge Program Administrator violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by denying him the opportunity to compete for a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> vacancy in a situation where the agency was accepting applications from outside its workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper remedy for a VEOA violation is reconstruction of the selection process in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Heckman v. Department of the Interior</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 16 (2008); <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (2005). Although the appellant is not necessarily entitled to be appointed to the Bridge Program Administrator position, if the reconstructed selection process results in the appellant's selection, he may be entitled to an award of compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of the agency's violation of his rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">Heckman</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
