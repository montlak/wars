<p class="noindent">Apart from its reconsideration authority, FLRA vacated prior decisions when, in its later judgment, a jurisdictional issue was improperly resolved. <span class="Italic">HUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 70 FLRA 605 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHUD and HUD Local 222</span>, 71 FLRA 17 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting)), vacated a series of prior decisions involving an arbitration award that was finally assessed to involve a nonarbitrable classification issue pertaining to promotion potential of positions and potential back pay. Member DuBester, dissenting, pointed out the hazards of vacating prior FLRA decisions (the majority decision provided little discussion of the matter; a footnote reference explained that the parties would no longer be concerned with any impact of prior awards of the arbitrator that were reviewed and remanded by the earlier FLRA decisions)). Member DuBester argued, 70 FLRA at 609-10:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The impulsive decision the majority makes today in this case is, to put it colloquially, a really bad idea. Once again losing sight of the distinction between adjudicating and legislating,[1] the majority, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, reaches back well over a decade to eliminate a series of Authority decisions, and arbitration awards, they do not like. Because the majority's decision has neither a legal foundation nor a legal justification, and leaves chaos rather than greater certainty and stability in its wake, I dissent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. DOL</span>, 70 FLRA 452, 458 n.8 (Dissenting Opinion of Member DuBester) (discussing the majority's "backdoor rulemaking" masquerading as adjudication).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are good reasons why courts and other adjudicative tribunals "vacate" final decisions only in extremely limited circumstances. These circumstances generally include a timely motion by a party, before too many actions in reliance on the decision have been taken, and reasons extrinsic to the proceeding itself, such as fraud or newly-discovered evidence.[2] But none of those circumstances are present here. Unbidden by the Agency that brought the current dispute before us, and which does not request this result, and wasting time on neither words nor reasoning, the majority in a few short paragraphs "vacates" seven decisions made by a variety of panels of Authority members reaching back well over a decade. And the majority does this despite the inconvenient legal reality that these decisions have long since become final decisions of the Authority, and the underlying arbitration awards have become "final and binding"[3] "for all purposes."[4] Also, the parties, fulfilling their legal obligations,[5] have for years been relying on these final and binding decisions and awards in deciding how to comply and what actions to take.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Undeterred by the lack of legal authorization for its actions, and heedless of the consequences, the majority impulsively, extralegally, seeks to travel back in time to undo what the majority would not have done if it, rather than those previous Members, had been in office. This is not what adjudicative tribunals, operating within the law, and respecting the finality and repose underlying the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, are authorized to do.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the majority goes even further, apparently claiming the authority to set aside awards to which no exceptions were ever filed.[7] These ultra vires actions are directly contrary to the Statute's injunction that "[i]f no <span id="page_2504"></span>exception to an arbitrator's award is filed..., the award shall be final and binding."[8]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And what of the majority's decision's retroactive consequences, a separate legal issue?[9] The majority avoids this uncomfortable subject. Under the Statute, the Arbitrator's first nine awards, including both those to which exceptions were denied, and those to which no exceptions were ever filed, are "final and binding" "for all purposes." But if those awards, "final and binding" "for all purposes," have somehow ceased to be so, as the majority claims, what is the status of any actions taken, or actions specifically not taken, by the Agency, the Union, and the thousands of potentially affected employees who may have made decisions and taken actions relying on those awards? The majority, in its haste to act, does not pause a moment to consider, and apparently does not care about, the chaos that its impulsive decision will cause. For example, what about the status of personnel actions taken, or postponed, years ago or recently, to comply with the "final and binding" awards? Or payments made to employees pursuant to the "final and binding" awards?[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;The majority appears confused on this point. <span class="Italic">See</span> Majority at 5 n.24 (one of the majority's Members justifying the <span class="Italic">retroactive</span> effect of the majority's decision based on Authority precedent in which the Authority determines, <span class="Italic">prospectively</span>, to "no longer follow" certain Authority precedent).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To be clear, I understand, and accept, that Authority Members may differ, sometimes sharply, on how cases that parties bring to the Authority should be resolved. But it is also my expectation, which I believe is reasonable, that the Authority's Members will be unified in their allegiance to the rule of law, a pillar of our democratic society, to fundamental adjudicatory principles applied by courts and administrative agencies, and to interpreting and applying the Statute "in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient government."[11] Because the majority's decision in this case is faithful to none of these precepts, I respectfully dissent.</p>

As relevant now, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">HUD VIII</span> that "[a]t all times...the essential nature of [the underlying] grievance--as demonstrated by the requested remedy--concerned classification."[4] As such, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute)[5] excluded the grievance from the negotiated grievance procedure and dismissed the grievance.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority granted the Agency's exceptions and vacated <span class="Italic">HUD I</span> through <span class="Italic">HUD VII</span> as well as the Arbitrator's written summaries. The Union now requests that we reconsider our decision in <span class="Italic">HUD VIII</span>. On June 8, 2018, the Union filed its motion for reconsideration. On June 25, 2018, the Agency requested leave to file--and did file--an opposition to the motion.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that extraordinary circumstances exist, and as a result has granted reconsideration, in a very limited number of situations. As relevant here, these have included where a moving party has established that the Authority had erred in its conclusion of law or factual findings.[9] But attempts to relitigate conclusions already reached by the Authority are insufficient.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority did not err by vacating final and binding decisions.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most of the Union's exceptions argue that the Authority was ultra vires and erred by "refusing to accept and acknowledge final and binding decisions," namely the prior arbitration awards and summaries."[12] Under &#x00A7; 7122(b), "[i]f no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed...during the [thirty]-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding."[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The Union alleges that that the Authority "disregarded prior Authority decisions which were final and binding." Mot. at 12. However, it is arbitration awards, not Authority decisions that become final and binding. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b) ("If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed [timely]...the <span class="Italic">award</span> shall be final and binding." (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union is correct that the prior arbitration awards and written summaries, with the exclusion of the tenth written summary,[15] were final and binding. Either the Agency filed exceptions to the awards[16] and written summaries[17]--and those exceptions were denied or dismissed[18]--or the Agency did not file exceptions within the thirty-day, statutory limit; thus the awards and written summaries, except the tenth written summary, were final and binding.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;Although the Authority did not directly address its Order to Show Cause concerning the timeliness of the Agency's exceptions to the tenth written summary, the decision in <span class="Italic">HUD VIII</span>, by addressing the issue of classification present in the tenth written summary, implicitly found the exceptions timely. Consequently, any arguments that exceptions to the tenth summary were untimely are merely an attempt to relitigate an issue already decided by the Authority. Mot. at 17.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) has agreed with the Authority that it may consider jurisdictional questions even where the merits of an underlying final and binding award are not at issue.[20] Thus, the Authority is not precluded from considering whether jurisdiction existed.</p>

FLRA</span>) (rejecting the argument that the Authority is not authorized to consider "challenges to the validity of an arbitrator's award in an unfair labor practice proceeding").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with unfair labor practices (ULPs), the Authority may reach into the merits of final and binding awards when a jurisdictional question is present.[21] It would be unreasonable, as well as inefficient and ineffective,[22] for the Authority to consider such jurisdictional questions on final and binding awards only after a ULP complaint has been filed but be unable to address that question directly now on exceptions. Fundamentally, questions of jurisdiction must be addressed when they appear, and the mere technicality of when in the process a party files exceptions does not act to extend jurisdiction to situations where statutorily none exists.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;For the same reasons, we reject the Union's argument that the Authority violated the Administrative Procedures Act by "disregarding" our own regulation concerning the deadline for filing exceptions and "impermissibly set aside prior final and binding decisions."

<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the Authority erred in its conclusions of law and "findings of fact" and deprived the Union and the grievants of a property interest without substantive due process.[27] We disagree.</p>

Supp.3d 12, 33 (D.D.C. 2014) (Allegations challenging a departure from procedures constitutes a substantive due process claim while allegations challenging an inherent infirmity of those procedures constitutes a procedural due process claim.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, in order to show a substantive due process violation,[28] the Union must first demonstrate that it had a vested property interest in "an expectation of continued employment," specifically the employment granted in the erroneous award. In the current case, any property right of the Union or the grievants could arise from either a legitimate expectation of a particular grade arising from the Arbitrator's awards or a legitimate claim of entitlement to the remedies.[30]</p>

Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985) ("Respondents' federal constitutional claim depends on their having had a property right in continued employment.")

<p class="noindent-1">Courts have held that federal employees do not have a legitimate expectation in "promises of appointment to a particular grade or step level"[31] or even "promises of promotion upon satisfaction of certain conditions."[32] Consequently, neither the Union nor the grievants can claim a property right based solely on any expectation arising from the remedies.</p>

United States</span>, 695 F.2d 1163, 1164 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 249-50 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Ganse v.

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union cannot claim a legitimate property interest through an entitlement to the remedies granted in the awards. The D.C. Circuit has ruled that "due process 'property interests' in public benefits are 'limited, as a general rule, by the governmental power to remove, through prescribed procedures, the <span class="Italic">underlying source of those benefits</span>."[33] As found in <span class="Italic">HUD VIII</span> and confirmed above, the Arbitrator was without jurisdiction to issue any awards, and the Authority vacated those awards. Consequently, the underlying source of any purported legitimate claim of entitlement--the erroneous awards--has been removed. Because the Authority acted within its authority to review arbitration awards, the removal of the underlying and erroneous awards vitiates any claim the Union or grievants might have in the awards' remedies.[34]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Union has not demonstrated a legitimate property interest. Furthermore, even assuming the Union could claim a legitimate property interest in the remedies, the Union has failed to demonstrate a violation of law, let alone an action that "shocks the conscience" in violation of substantive due process.[35] The D.C. Circuit ruled that, where a court rejects an appeal challenging an exercise of jurisdiction, there is no substantive due process violation.[36] The Court also held that, for substantive due process claims, "[t]he threshold for such a constitutional violation is unclear, but this court has held that a mere violation of law does not give rise to a due process claim."[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 446 v. Nicholson</span>, 475 F.3d at 353.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>. ("We have held that the timing of the [jurisdictional-challenging d]ecision was not unlawful, and so our discussion of the [u]nion's due process claim comes to an end.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Union has not demonstrated that the Authority erred in its jurisdictional finding in <span class="Italic">HUD VIII</span> or violated the substantive due process rights of the Union or the grievants.[38] Consequently, this argument does not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances warranting the reconsideration of <span class="Italic">HUD VIII</span>.</p>
