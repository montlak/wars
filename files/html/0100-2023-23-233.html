<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-200a"><span class="space">20.</span> Reprisal or Harassment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Most litigation involving settlements stems from an effort to set the agreement aside because an appellant thinks he received less than he should have or because an agency misinterpreted or failed to abide by its affirmative obligations under the agreement. Some appellants add to the usual challenges complaints of harassment or reprisal by agency personnel following a settlement that returns the appellant to the workplace. "[t]he Board has continuing jurisdiction to review specific allegations of retaliatory actions constituting noncompliance." <span class="Italic">Corsiglia v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 447, 448-49 (1996). The Board considers enforcement petitions that allege harassment or reprisal following settlement, although the appellant who brings the charge has a high burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some settlements expressly prohibit harassment or reprisal. If an agency promises in a settlement that the appellant will not be harassed, the Board must adjudicate the nonfrivolous complaints of harassment and permit the development of evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Womack v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 213, 216 (1994). Following remand in <span class="Italic">Womack</span>, the Board reiterated that it had the authority to ensure agency compliance with a non-harassment agreement, <span class="Italic">Womack v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 58, 61 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[t]he issue here is not the feasibility of reassignment; it is the agency's obligation to prevent the appellant from being harassed, intimidated, or reprised against. The agency's obligations under the settlement provision are no more expansive than those under other settlement provisions held enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Del Balzo v. Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 659 (1994) (agency's knowing allowance of employees to provide information to reference investigator in contravention of settlement provision constitutes breach of agreement). Moreover, the agency's responsibility here is very similar to its statutory responsibilities to every employee under the merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301, 2302. An agency cannot avoid these responsibilities by claiming a lack of control over its employees. To the contrary, it is responsible for the actions of its employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that an agency cannot prevent every improper activity by every employee, it can take steps--including employee training, immediate attention to reported wrongdoing, and discipline where warranted--to minimize such prohibited conduct. Here, where there is a specific contractual obligation to one employee, we have been presented with no reason why the agency cannot focus on her situation to prevent and, in the unlikely event of failure to prevent, to promptly stop any attempt by agency personnel to harass or intimidate her or to take action in reprisal against her.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether expressed in the settlement or not, under <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 320-25, 328-29 (1995), the agency has an implied obligation of good faith in the administration of a settlement. The Board will entertain, through its enforcement and compliance proceedings, substantive allegations of harassment and reprisal by appellants who enter into settlements (including last chance agreements) with their agencies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ noted, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Department of the Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 587 (1990), that, in enforcing a settlement agreement that was silent as to retaliation, it would nevertheless consider the appellant's allegations of retaliation because "[a]n employee who is being retaliated against for having filed an appeal with the Board has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>...." This holding was based on <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. US Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 276, 279 (1988), which, in turn, was based on <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984), in which the Board held that when a personnel action is reversed, the agency must "place the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." 726 F.2d at 733.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 635, 640-42 (1991), however, the Board rejected a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis of settlement terms, and thus refused to imply back pay into a settlement term that simply provided for cancellation of the personnel action. Contrary to the appellant's argument on petition for review that, for purposes of applying the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis, there is no reason to distinguish between enforcing the Board's reversal of an agency's action, such as in <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, and enforcing the parties' settlement agreement, as here, there are fundamental differences between the two. Unlike the Board's adjudication in the former situation, the settlement agreement in the latter situation generally does not specify or imply that the underlying personnel action was wrong, and the Board is not enforcing its own determinations but rather the parties' bargained-for agreement, based on contract law principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 673, 675 (1993); <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, 50 MSPR at 640-42; <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Jones v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 56 MSPR 311, 315 (1993). Therefore, the rationale for applying a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis to the former situation--that "when a wrong has been done...[t]he injured party is to be placed, as near as may be, in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed"--generally does not apply to the latter situation. <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733 n.3; <span class="Italic">see Kelley</span>, 50 MSPR at 640-42. Hence, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Kelley</span> that "in construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the four corners of the agreement itself shall be examined to determine the parties' intent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 642; <span class="Italic">see also Beard v. Department of Defense</span>, 57 MSPR 355, 357-58 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although, as the appellant appears to argue on petition for review, <span class="Italic">Kelley</span> did not explicitly overrule <span class="Italic">Baughman</span>, it did so implicitly, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Baughman</span> <span class="Italic">per se</span> applied a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis in enforcing a settlement agreement. We reaffirm here that the Board will not <span class="Italic">per se</span> apply a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis to settlement terms,[3] and we find that the appellant has shown no basis for applying such an analysis to any settlement term here. Because <span class="Italic">Kelley</span> did not involve allegations of retaliation, however, it did not necessarily overrule the conclusion in <span class="Italic">Baughman</span>, nor does it preclude the possibility here, that the Board could consider allegations of retaliation on grounds other than the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis would apply, needless to say, if the settlement agreement included a term specifying that the employee should be returned to the "<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." We note that in <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 559, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court, in the context of interpreting a settlement term requiring the agency's payment of the appellant's attorney fees, stated that the <span id="Page_5150"></span>settlement agreement there "required, as far as possible, a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." In making this statement, the court cited the rationale, applicable to fully adjudicated cases, that "[a]n injured party must be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position he would have occupied had the wrong not been committed." 852 F.2d at 561 n.4. Because <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is a broad and imprecise concept that, in general, should not be implied into specific settlement terms, <span class="Italic">cf. Kelley</span>, 50 MSPR at 640-42, and because as discussed in the text above, the Board has since determined that such a rationale is inapplicable to settlement agreements, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, we decline to extend the above-quoted "<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>" statement in <span class="Italic">Greco</span> beyond the particular settlement terms and facts there at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, to be construed based on principles of contract law. <span class="Italic">See Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. US Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992). Since it is undisputed that the settlement agreement here did not mention retaliation/harassment by the agency, the question is whether the agreement nevertheless should be construed as covering the appellant's allegations of retaliation/harassment. Although the appellant has not specified that those allegations are related to the settlement term requiring her reinstatement to the Voucher Examiner position ("the reinstatement term"), the allegations themselves, as well as her related arguments, have implied as much.[4] Because, in enforcing a settlement agreement, the Board may consider any allegation that is relevant in determining noncompliance with a particular settlement term, we will examine whether the appellant's allegations are relevant in determining the agency's noncompliance with the reinstatement term. <span class="Italic">See generally, e.g., Nance v. Department of Transportation</span>, 55 MSPR 68, 70, 72 (1992) (the appellant's allegations that the agency's post-settlement actions constituted whistleblower reprisal and retaliation, prohibited by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), (9), may be considered "to the extent" that they "pertain to breach of the agreement"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bales v. Department of Transportation</span>, 54 MSPR 187, 190 (1992) (the Board refused to consider the appellant's allegations of retaliation "because they d[id] not relate to any provision of the settlement agreement").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The allegations on their face, concerning her working environment, are pertinent to the reinstatement term, as further discussed in the text below. Moreover, it is apparent from her albeit-misguided <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> arguments that she believes the allegations are pertinent to her reinstatement to the Voucher Examiner position, just as if the Board had reversed the agency's action on the merits and ordered her reinstatement to that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing settlement terms similar to the reinstatement term here, i.e., those requiring the agency to assign the employee to a particular position, the Board has found in effect that the agency's obligation to implement the settlement term is not necessarily fully satisfied the moment it technically and facially reinstates the employee to the position in question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Keenan v. US Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 307, 308-10 (1994) (the Board found that the agency's obligation to comply with a settlement term requiring the appellant's assignment as a part-time flexible clerk extended beyond merely assigning him to that position and included not unjustifiably depriving him of 40 hours of work per week); <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 52 MSPR at 563-64 (where the agency agreed to assign the appellant to a particular position as part of a settlement agreement, its compliance obligation existed for a "reasonable time under the circumstances"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Norris Concrete and Dodson</span>, 282 NLRB 289, No. 45, 123 LRRM (BNA) 1329, 1331 (1986) (despite the employer's facial compliance with the settlement term requiring the employee's reinstatement, its retaliatory post-settlement actions that negated the purpose of the term constituted noncompliance with it). Construing such a settlement term as obligating the agency merely to technically and facially reinstate the appellant would be unreasonable, in general, because it would render the term largely meaningless in terms of any substantial benefit to the employee.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Just as a settlement agreement could explicitly broaden the agency's obligation with respect to a reinstatement term by specifying that the agency would ensure against all retaliation/harassment on the job, <span class="Italic">see Womack v. US Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 213, 216-18 (1994), <span class="Italic">interlocutory appeal after remand</span>, 67 MSPR 58 (1995), the agreement could potentially narrow the agency's obligation in this regard. The settlement agreement here did not explicitly broaden or narrow the agency's obligation in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, it is well-settled that implicit in any settlement agreement, as under other contracts, is a requirement that the parties fulfill their respective contractual obligations in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">McCall v. US Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Hicks</span>, 52 MSPR at 565. "Good faith performance...of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party; it excludes a variety of types of conduct characterized as involving 'bad faith' because they violate community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness." Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 205 comment a (1979). Thus, a party may breach a settlement agreement by acting in bad faith[6] with respect to a settlement term, <span class="Italic">see Link</span>, 51 F.3d at 1581, and the appellant may establish that the agency breached the settlement agreement by showing that the agency's retaliatory/harassing actions constituted bad-faith noncompliance with the reinstatement term. <span class="Italic">See Keenan</span>, 62 MSPR at 308 (the agency's failure to assign the employee 40 hours of work per week constituted failure to comply in good faith with the settlement term requiring his reinstatement to a "part-time flexible" Postal position); <span class="Italic">see also Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 621, 626 (1993) (the employee's allegations of whistleblower reprisal and general animosity towards him were considered in determining whether the agency acted in bad faith in enforcing the last chance settlement agreement); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 205 comment a, illustration 2; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Solar Turbines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 23 Cl. Ct. 142, 156 (1991) (in every contract there is an "implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing" that "neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract"); <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 52 MSPR at 565 (where there was no showing that the agency acted in bad faith when it reassigned the appellant 10 months after he was reinstated pursuant to a settlement term, the agency did not breach the settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;"Bad faith" is the opposite of "good faith" and refers to a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive; it is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. <span class="Italic">Silva v. US Postal Service</span>, 59 MSPR 268, 272 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that allowing employees to raise, via enforcement proceedings, any and all complaints about perceived retaliation/harassment following their reinstatement would, as the agency argues, allow litigation to continue "ad nauseam," contrary to the purpose of settlement agreements to bring "closure [to] disputes between the parties."[8] <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">De Luna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 526, 529 (1993) (settlement agreements serve to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues). On the other hand, for the Board to refuse any review of an agency's conduct that effectively deprives an employee of the fruits of the settlement agreement would denigrate the integrity of settlements, which play an integral role in resolving federal employment disputes, and would allow agencies to profit from their misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Norris Concrete</span>, 282 NLRB 289, No. 45, 123 LRRM at 1332; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harkins</span>, 60 MSPR 646, 648 (1994) (the Board favors settlement agreements).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) treats allegations of post-settlement retaliation as separate EEO claims, rather than as part of a petition for enforcement, even if retaliation was explicitly prohibited by the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c); <span class="Italic">Hunter v. West</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941115, slip op. at 7 (Aug. 4, 1994) ("allegations of reprisal or further discrimination in violation of a settlement agreement's 'no reprisal' clause, are to be processed as separate complaints and not as a breach of settlement"); <span class="Italic">Fagone v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04930008, slip op. at 4 (Apr. 21, 1994) (similar holding). The EEOC's rationale for this rule is that a contrary rule "would, in essence, permit an appellant to reopen his complaint endlessly" and destroy the finality of settlement agreements and "would permit new allegations to be raised without regard to counseling requirements or time limitations, a result neither expressly nor implicitly sanctioned by the EEO Regulations." <span class="Italic">Fagone</span>, slip op. at 4 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bindal v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900225 (Aug. 9, 1990)). Unlike the EEOC, however, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear allegations of retaliation under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and (9) that are unrelated to an otherwise appealable action, so that such allegations could not be pursued as separate Board appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that an agency's post-settlement harassment and retaliation against an appellant could establish its noncompliance with a settlement term requiring her reinstatement. To establish a breach of the settlement agreement based on this implied covenant of good faith with respect to the reinstatement term, however, it is the appellant's burden to show that the agency's proven retaliatory/harassing actions, under the totality of the circumstances, amounted to an unjustified and substantial deprivation of her rights as an incumbent of the position in question. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Norris Concrete</span>, 282 NLRB 289, No. 45, 123 LRRM at 1330-31 (despite the employer's facial compliance with the settlement agreement, its actions including assigning the employee a dangerous truck, reprimanding him for an incident that never occurred, and other <span id="Page_5151"></span>unjustified actions that resulted in his constructive discharge established its noncompliance with the settlement term requiring his reinstatement). It is to be expected that affected agency personnel and the appellant might feel awkward and sensitive toward each other following their participation in an employment dispute before a body such as the Board, even after resolving their differences in a settlement agreement, and we emphasize that we cannot and will not redress within the confines of enforcement proceedings every perceived, or even real, slight. Therefore, a mere showing of some frictions, misunderstandings, or unpleasantness between the appellant and other employees or managers will not be sufficient to meet this burden. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 30 MSPR 119, 127-28 (1986) (following the Board's reversal of the employee's removal action, an allegation that coworkers and supervisors were not congenial or enthusiastic with respect to his return to work did not show that the agency failed its good faith obligation with respect to his reinstatement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that the appellant's allegations that the agency management instituted a campaign of harassment and retaliation against her, immediately and continually after her reinstatement to the Voucher Examiner position, are relevant to the issue of whether the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to implement in good faith the reinstatement term.[9] Hence, we find that the AJ erred by refusing to consider the appellant's allegations of retaliation/harassment here. For the reasons discussed below, however, we find that the AJ's adjudicatory error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Although the agency's obligation with respect to the reinstatement term extends only for a reasonable period of time, the duration of the agency's obligation is not an issue before us because the agency's alleged actions here were taken within days and months after the appellant's reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hicks</span>, 52 MSPR at 563-64 (if the settlement agreement does not specify a time period for performance of a settlement term, a reasonable time will be implied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an agency bears a heavy burden of production to submit all of the relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance responsive to an appellant's allegations, the appellant has the ultimate burden of establishing that the agency breached the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 371 (1988). We find it telling that the appellant here has not submitted any independent documentation, such as statements by witnesses, to support any of her numerous allegations of continual and overwhelming retaliation/harassment. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, the agency here was not "wholly possessed of the [relevant] evidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1578. Nor was she entitled to her requested discovery and hearing to establish her allegations. An employee is not entitled to them in enforcement proceedings, although the AJ may grant them in his discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Forston v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 154, 158 (1993); <span class="Italic">Covert v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 376, 382 (1986). Because the appellant failed to specify below any genuine issue of material fact for which discovery and a hearing were warranted,[12] the AJ did not abuse his discretion in denying them. <span class="Italic">Cf. Briscoe v. Veterans Administration</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (where the appellant presented no evidence to support her "bald allegations" of jurisdiction, those allegations were "frivolous" and thus did not warrant a jurisdictional hearing). We therefore find that the appellant failed to meet her burden of establishing that the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to implement in good faith the reinstatement term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;In requesting discovery below, the appellant simply contended that the agency had "generally denie[d]" her allegations, that the "true facts" could only be revealed through discovery, and that she wished to "ascertain what the Agency ha[d] done in similar situations regarding other employees who ha[d] not filed mixed case appeals with the Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to presume that the issue of whether the agency breached the settlement agreement and the issue of whether the agency committed prohibited personnel practices under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and (9) are one and the same, or at least inextricably intertwined here. We find that they are not. To establish a breach of the settlement agreement, the agency's alleged retaliatory/harassing actions need not amount to prohibited personnel practices under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b). If the agency took unjustified actions substantially depriving the appellant of her rights as an incumbent of the Voucher Examiner position, such actions may establish its noncompliance with the reinstatement term, as discussed above, even though they may not involve a "personnel action" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) or otherwise constitute a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's argument, 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Wren v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 2 MSPB 174, 2 MSPR 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C.

The responsibilities covered by this good faith provision include the agency's obligation to detail the appellant to the position of Systems Analyst for a period not to exceed 120 calendar days but not less than 90 calendar days. We thus will consider the appellant's allegation that the agency instituted a campaign of harassment and retaliation against him, immediately and continually after his assignment to the detail, as a claim that the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to implement in good faith the detail term. <span class="Italic">See Kuykendall</span>, 68 MSPR at 324-25.</p>

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 6, 11 (1996) (an appellant can show bad faith if he can establish that, at the time that the parties entered into the agreement, the agency knew that the duty location specified in the agreement would soon be moved and the appellant could not be accommodated). A party may establish a breach of an agreement by showing that the other party acted in bad faith with respect to a term of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 323 (1995). The Board has defined "bad faith" as "the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obloquy." Adams, 72 MSPR at 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. VA</span>, NY-0752-12-0182-C-1 (NP 5/5/2014), said of bad faith through retaliatory or harassing actions during implementation or nonimplementation of a settlement, at n.3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A party may breach a settlement agreement by acting in bad faith with respect to a settlement term, and the appellant may establish that the agency breached the settlement agreement by showing that the agency's retaliatory or harassing actions constituted bad-faith noncompliance. <span class="Italic">See Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 314, 323 (1995). The Board has defined "bad faith" as "the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity." <span class="Italic">Adams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 6, 11 (1996). The appellant's arguments on review present no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to prove the agency's actions constituted bad-faith noncompliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, of allegations of post-settlement harassment or reprisal, <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-531D-12-0684-C-1 (NP 9/5/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well settled that implicit in any agreement, as under other contracts, is a requirement that the parties fulfill their respective contractual obligations in good faith. <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 314, 323 (1995). A party may breach a settlement agreement by acting in bad faith concerning a settlement term, and an appellant may establish that an agency breached the settlement agreement by showing that the agency's post-settlement harassment and retaliation against him constituted bad-faith noncompliance with a term of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 323-24. "Bad faith" is not simply bad judgment or negligence but instead implies conscious wrongdoing because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. <span class="Italic">See Silva v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 268, 272 (1993) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). A mere showing of some frictions, misunderstandings, or unpleasantness between the appellant and other employees or management is insufficient to establish bad-faith noncompliance with a term of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Stasiuk v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 7 (2012). The Board may only consider the appellant's allegations that the agency's post-settlement actions constituted retaliation for filing and settling his Board appeal to the extent that his allegations pertain to the alleged breach of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim of reprisal necessitates an analysis of intent. If an appellant asserts that an agency official issued defamatory statements in violation of a nonreprisal clause in an OSC settlement, the Board expects that the appellant will prove that the statements were made with the purpose of taking reprisal, particularly when the facts suggest that the agency's statements were not made with the intent asserted by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DOJ</span>, 88 MSPR 116, 119-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2001) ("Mere negative comments without more do not constitute retaliation where, as here, the agreement contains no confidentiality provision, or any other provision limiting the right of the parties to discuss Mr. Jacobs's appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board considers claims of harassment violating the implied covenant of good faith in a settlement agreement requiring reinstatement, the Board may decline to require a hearing on insubstantial claims of harassment. <span class="Italic">McFall v. USDA</span>, 78 MSPR 513, 517 (1998) (Board concluded without a hearing that no harassment was reasonably alleged as to brief period of time that passed without performance rating and claim of promotion when the agreement did not call for promotion and arguably comparable employees were not promoted); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 556, 561 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (although in enforcement proceedings an appellant may not raise a whistleblowing claim, claims of reprisal may be raised in an enforcement proceeding to show that the agency breached the settlement by acting in bad faith); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Beall v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 78 MSPR 185, 187 n.3 (1998) ("To the extent the AJ applied the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis in construing the terms of the settlement agreement, the recommendation is inconsistent with Board law.").
