<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-177"><span class="space">b.</span> Conflict of Interests</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7120(e):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This chapter does not authorize participation in the management of a labor organization or acting as a representative of a labor organization by a management official, a supervisor, or a confidential employee, except as specifically provided in this chapter, or by an employee if the participation or activity would result in a conflict or apparent conflict of interest or would otherwise be incompatible with law or with the official duties of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no absolute preclusion against management speaking to an employee about a real or perceived conflict between achievement of its mission and union activities. <span class="Italic">Army Military Traffic Mgmt. Command, E. Area and AFGE Local 2855</span>, 16 FLRA 881, 896 n.13 (1984) (ALJ Decision).There is no interference or discrimination if a personnel clerk who is excluded from the bargaining unit because of her work on management labor-relations matters is told that performance of her duties is incompatible with her duties as a union official and she is asked to discontinue union office if she desires to stay in her nonunit position. It is not interference to offer the nonunit employee another job in the unit if the employee desires to retain the union position. <span class="Italic">Navy Pub. Works Ctr., Norfolk Naval Base and AFGE Local 53</span>, 5 FLRA 389, 394-95 (1981) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Army Intelligence Ctr., Ft. Huachuca and AFGE Local 1662</span>, 54 FLRA 794, 805-06 (1998) (ALJ Decision) (employer did not commit a ULP by refusing, on basis of a conflict of interest, to permit union steward from acting as personal representative to personnel staffing specialist who was excluded from the unit, advised management on personnel matters, and had access to confidential personnel information). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-183.html#sec8-183">Balancing Official Time and Work Needs</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless there is union animus, an agency does not commit a ULP by asking an EEO counselor who is also a union officer to explain the nature of her union work so that the agency can ascertain whether there is a conflict of position under &#x00A7; 7120(e); nor is there a ULP committed if the agency admonishes the union official not to engage in specified future conduct that would constitute a conflict or apparent conflict of interest. <span class="Italic">Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hosp. and AFGE Local 3399</span>, 8 FLRA 42, 43-44 (1982). It was implied that management would commit a ULP by refusing to consider an individual for the position of EEO counselor based on any union office, but no ULP occurred when an applicant was refused for the EEO position because he was a union vice president, a position that was visible and significant in the union and that involved representational and adversarial duties. <span class="Italic">DHEW, Region VIII, Denver and AFGE Local 1802</span>, 6 FLRA 628, 637-38 (1981) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA restated its position when it determined that a proposal was negotiable that the parties agree that anyone serving as an EEO counselor (and, in particular, union officials) relinquished the right to represent a complainant in any discrimination complaint, <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 3 and Naval Sea Sys. Command Detachment</span>, 25 FLRA 714, 723-24 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he provision merely recognizes that an employee who is a Union officer or steward cannot function both as an EEO Counselor and as an employee representative in a discrimination complaint proceeding because doing so would create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. This recognition is entirely consistent with applicable Authority precedent [<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Harry S. Truman Memorial Hospital</span> and <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA Region VIII</span>]....&#8197;Thus, this provision does not violate Section 7120(e) of the Statute. Moreover, this Authority precedent indicates that an employee is not automatically barred from serving as an EEO Counselor because that employee is currently a Union officer or steward. Rather, <span id="Page_1412"></span>the determination whether to bar a Union officer or steward from also serving as an EEO Counselor is to be made on the basis of the duties of the particular union office in question.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">CREA, IFPTE Local 75 and Library of Congress</span>, 59 FLRA 994, 1001 (2004), confirmed that an agency could eliminate a conflict or apparent conflict of interest involved in a work assignment to a union representative who was tasked with conducting a research project concerning collective bargaining rights. The agency, charged with conducting impartial investigations, was not faulted for removing the assignment from the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise of any right provided by the Statute. Section 7102 of the Statute sets forth certain employee rights including the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal and that each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. Such right includes the right to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative. Also, the Authority has held that serving as a Union representative is "not without limitation[,]" under the Statute when such activity "would result in a conflict or apparent conflict of interest" under &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, National Office</span>, 41 FLRA 402, 413 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances presented in this case, the Agency's decision to reassign the Union President's work because of an apparent conflict of interest was reasonable within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute. Therefore, the Agency was permitted to remove the work assignment to avoid an apparent conflict of interest under &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute. As the Agency's decision to remove the work assignment was lawful under the Statute and as the Union contested only the removal of the work itself, and raised no issues regarding the manner in which the work was removed, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the award as it concerns the removal of the work violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the subject of representation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS Nat'l Office and NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 402, 403-05, 412-16 (1991),limited the right of an agency to declare its employees (specifically, an agency attorney) in a conflict of interest when they undertake, as union representatives, representation of coworkers. The case arose in the context of an EEO complaint. The agency committed a ULP by applying a broad conflict rule prohibiting the representation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since 1987, the Union's Chapter 251 has been the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit of about 600 employees in the OCC. The OCC is a component of the Treasury Department's Legal Division, which is headed by the General Counsel. About 300 of the unit employees are attorneys.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Warren Joseph is an attorney in OCC and is the Executive Vice President and Chief Steward of Chapter 251.&#x2003;His duties include drafting responses to inquiries from taxpayers and giving advice to IRS field offices concerning tax matters. The attorneys in OCC, including Joseph, do not participate on the Respondent's behalf in EEO matters and do not have access to the Respondent's files dealing with EEO matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During 1987, unit employee Benjamin Foster filed an EEO complaint under the Respondent's EEO appeals procedure. Foster designated the Union as his representative, and the Union designated Joseph to handle Foster's case. The Treasury Department's EEO procedures governing the processing of complaints provide, in Part XIV, Section (b)(1) and (2), respectively, that: (1) a complainant's representative may be an employee of the Department so long as representation is consistent with the faithful performance of his or her duties; and (2) a complainant may be represented by the Union unless such representation would constitute a conflict of interest or position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Foster's complaint was pending formal hearing, the Respondent filed a motion with the hearing officer to disqualify Joseph from representing Foster. The Respondent argued that Joseph was subject to General Counsel Directive No. 6 (Directive No. 6) because he is an attorney in OCC. Directive No. 6 was issued by the Department's General Counsel and states the following in section 2(D), entitled "Other Outside Employment":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Permission to engage in other outside employment may be granted when there is a showing by the attorney that such employment is wholly consistent with the general policies set forth in this Directive. Representation of individual Treasury Department employees in disciplinary or grievance proceedings in any hearing of any nature is determined to be prohibited employment regardless of whether any form of compensation is received.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Directive No.&#x2003;6 "has been narrowly interpreted by the [Department's] General Counsel as prohibiting Chief Counsel attorneys from providing representation, even for Chief Counsel employees, in administrative and court hearings, including those involving EEO matters."...&#8197;The Respondent contended that permitting Joseph to represent Foster would be inconsistent with Part XIV(b)(1) of the Respondent's EEO procedures which, as noted above, provides that a complainant's representative may be an employee of the Department so long as representation is consistent with the faithful performance of his or her duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Joseph filed an opposition to the motion with the hearing officer.&#x2003;In his opposition, Joseph noted, among other things, the rights of employees to act on behalf of a labor organization guaranteed by section 7102 of the Statute and relevant provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement authorizing union representation in the Respondent's EEO statutory appeals procedure. In this regard, section 2.D.4. of the parties' collective bargaining agreement provides that official time shall be granted to Union stewards for "meetings to present appeals in connection with statutory or regulatory appeal procedures in which the union is designated as the representative." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2-3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The hearing officer referred the Respondent's motion to the Department's Office of Equal Opportunity Program (OEOP). Joseph filed a response to the motion with the OEOP, restating his position and arguing further that even if Directive No. 6 did apply to EEO proceedings, it had been superseded by the Statute. While the matter was pending before the OEOP, the Respondent ordered Joseph to cease his representation of Foster because that representation violated Directive No. 6. After explaining the relevant statutory provisions and contractual requirements to the Respondent, Joseph was again directed by the Respondent not to represent Foster.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OEOP ruled that the motion to disqualify Joseph was without merit.&#x2003;OEOP noted that the Respondent was not asserting that Joseph's actual duties created any conflict of interest, but was relying instead on the "broad prohibition in General Counsel Directive No. 6 of outside employment to allege conflict."...&#8197;OEOP found that "there is no conflict between the assigned duties of Joseph's position and his representation of complainant. The [Union] will be allowed to remain as complainant's designated representative and Mr. Joseph will be allowed to continue to participate in the complaint process on behalf of the [U]nion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OEOP noted, however, that it did not attempt to interpret or rule on the validity of the General Counsel Directive in this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Joseph submitted the OEOP decision to the Respondent.&#x2003;Without referencing the OEOP decision, the Respondent again ordered Joseph to stop representing any complainant in any EEO matter. Joseph ceased representing Foster and another employee whose EEO complaint was pending. Foster was unable to secure representation for his EEO case and proceeded alone in his prehearing conference proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by enforcing Directive No. 6 to preclude Joseph from representing Foster on behalf of the Union in an EEO proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under [the Statute]." If an agency applies its regulations so as to prohibit unit employees from exercising rights under section 7102 of the Statute, such action constitutes unlawful interference with those rights in violation of section 7116(a)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7102 of the Statute, employees have the right to "form, join, or assist" a labor organization....&#8197;Employee rights under section 7102 include the right "to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization to the heads of agencies[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's assertion that employees acting on behalf of a union do not have a right under section 7102 of the Statute to represent unit employees in a statutory appeal process. The statutory right of employees to serve as union representatives extends to any of the procedures whereby the union represents the views of the union and the unit employees concerning conditions of employment, including statutory appeals procedures....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This right of employees is not, however, without limitation. Under section 7120(e) of the Statute, an employee is precluded from "acting as a representative of a labor organization" where that activity "would result in a conflict or apparent conflict of interest or would otherwise be incompatible with law or with the official duties of the employee." We find, therefore, that unless precluded by section 7120(e) or otherwise prohibited by law, unit employees have a statutory right to represent other unit employees on behalf of the union with respect to matters affecting conditions of employment, including EEO matters. An agency's interference with that statutory right is an unfair labor practice under section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the complainant chose the union as his representative and the Union designated Joseph to represent the Union. Consequently, we find that enforcement by the Respondent of Directive No. 6 to prohibit <span id="Page_1413"></span>Joseph from representing the union in presenting an EEO complaint interfered with Joseph's right under section 7102 of the Statute in violation of section 7116(a)(1), unless such representation was prohibited by section 7120(e) because that representation would result in a conflict of interest or would be incompatible with his official duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In our view, section 7120(e) does not automatically preclude an employee from serving as a union representative for another agency employee in an EEO dispute against the agency, simply by virtue of the fact that both employees work in the same agency. Such a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule would be inconsistent with the statutory labor-management relations framework Congress enacted. Rather, in order to determine whether the proscription in section 7120(e) applies in a given case, a respondent's "conduct must be judged by the reasonableness of its actions in all the circumstances."...&#8197;In this case, we find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that Joseph had a conflict of interest in representing another employee on behalf of the Union in an EEO proceeding. We note, in this regard, that the Department's OEOP found that "there is no conflict between the assigned duties of Joseph's position and his representation of complainant."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has not demonstrated why enforcement of Directive No.&#x2003;6 as a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule barring attorneys, including Joseph, from serving as representatives in EEO proceedings is necessary to prevent conflicts of interest, while no such conflict would be present if the attorney served as a representative in a grievance proceeding involving an EEO matter. The Union claims, and the Respondent does not dispute, that Agency attorneys represent employees in grievances against the Agency. There is, however, no evidence in the record, nor does the Agency demonstrate, that the nature of an EEO proceeding, as distinguished from the negotiated grievance procedure, is such as to give rise to an inherent conflict of interest where an Agency attorney represents an Agency employee in a complaint against the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also asserts that Joseph's employment as an Agency attorney creates an inherent conflict of interest, or an incompatibility with the duties of his position, with respect to his representation of any other Agency employee in an EEO complaint against the Agency because the client of any agency attorney is the agency itself. <span class="Italic">Citing</span> <span class="Italic">Bachman v. Pertschuck</span>, 437 F. Supp. 973 (D.D.C. 1977), the Respondent argues that representation of another unit employee by an agency attorney in a complaint against the agency creates a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, because the attorney is acting contrary to the interest of the client.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bachman</span> to be misplaced. <span class="Italic">Bachman</span> differs from this case in several important respects. <span class="Italic">Bachman</span> involved a class-action suit in which the attorney whose representation was found to create a conflict was a member of the same class of employees bringing suit against the Federal Government and stood to gain personally from the outcome of the suit. In contrast, the attorney in this case sought to represent an individual and was not a member of a class, and there is no evidence that he would have benefitted personally as a result of representing the individual in the EEO proceeding....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, as the court in <span class="Italic">Bachman</span> specifically noted, 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205 provides that a Federal employee may represent another Federal employee in an administrative proceeding if the representation is not inconsistent with the faithful performance of the representative's duties. <span class="Italic">Bachman</span>, 437 F. Supp. at 976. Under 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205, therefore, the fact that Joseph was acting as a representative in an administrative proceeding against the Agency would not constitute a conflict of interest unless that activity was inconsistent with the faithful performance of his duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, a significant difference between the instant case and <span class="Italic">Bachman</span> is that the employee in <span class="Italic">Bachman</span> was not acting in the capacity of a union representative and was not exercising a right under the Statute. While 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205 governs the actions of Federal employees acting as personal representatives or attorneys for other Federal employees, that section does not deal with the right of Federal employees, under sections 7102 and 7120(e) of the Statute, to act as union representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find no merit in the Respondent's contention that because the Rules of Conduct governing Agency attorneys require the attorneys to adhere to all Agency policies and directives, including Directive No. 6, attorneys who fail to comply with those directives are acting in a manner that is inconsistent with the obligations of their positions. Because, as we found above, the Agency's position fails to take into account applicable statutory provisions, the Agency may not enforce Directive No. 6 in such a manner as to preclude representation unless such representation would be inconsistent with the faithful performance of an employee's duties. In this case, as we determined above, the Respondent has not shown that representation by Joseph is inconsistent with the faithful performance of his duties. We note, in this regard, that the Respondent's own EEO office determined that there was no conflict between Joseph's official duties and his representation of the complainant on behalf of the Union and ruled that Joseph be allowed to continue representing the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Bernsen</span>, 53 FLRA 1541, 1547-54 (1998), determined that no apparent or potential conflict of interest barred simultaneous service by an agency employee as an ethics counselor and a union officer; neither the agency nor the union committed a ULP through the arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge, relying upon <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 41 FLRA 402, opined that apparent conflicts of interest under section 7120(e) must be considered in light of all the circumstances and that the standard "is triggered where an objectively reasonable person would view the facts as creating such a conflict." The Judge also determined that the reasonable person standard was objective rather than subjective. As a result, the standard is not triggered by those who might have mistaken impressions as to either the nature of one's duties or the governing laws or rules. On the contrary, "[t]he objectively reasonable person is presumed to know the duties in question and related policies and procedures." In this regard, and as the Judge noted, in a representation case the Authority recognized that an "appearance of a conflict of interest is [&#8197;]dispelled by knowledge of the process by which Agency management reviews the work product of [the employee involved]." <span class="Italic">MSPB</span>, 12 FLRA at 141 n.7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other areas where there are requirements involving the "appearance" of impropriety, the standards utilized are comparable with the test adopted by the Judge. For instance, in describing rules concerning personal and business relationships as related to performing official duties, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2635.502, the OGE explained that the test is "whether a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question" an employee's impartiality. 57 Fed. Reg. 35025 (August 7, 1992). Similarly, canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility for Attorneys requires that "[a] lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety." Compliance with this requirement has been subjected to an "objective member of the public at large" standard. <span class="Italic">United States v. Smith</span>, 653 F.2d 126, 128 (4th Cir. 1981). As a result, "a fanciful, unrealistic or purely subjective suspicion of impropriety" does not implicate the canon<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and the Charging Party disagree with the standard adopted by the Judge, arguing that it is inconsistent with both the laws of agency and the intent of section 7120(e). They argue that under agency law, an agent can only serve one principal and here Jaffe must serve two. The Charging Party asserts that employees are entitled to representatives who have single-minded loyalty to the employee's interests. Both the General Counsel and the Charging Party claim that the nature of the duties in these two positions is such that there is an apparent conflict.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Judge properly rejected these arguments, relying in part on the United States Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Town &#x0026; Country Electric,</span> 116 S. Ct. 450. The General Counsel's and the Charging Party's assertions that this reliance was misplaced are not persuasive. Although the Supreme Court's decision does not resolve the apparent conflict of interest issue here, it does offer guidance on agency law. As a result, it was permissible for the Judge to take into consideration the Supreme Court's pronouncement that so long as service to one master does not amount to abandonment of the service owed to the other, an employee can serve two masters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's rejection of the "single minded loyalty" standard, because if this were the rule, Federal sector unions could only be serviced by full-time paid union staff. As the Judge noted, this would be both unworkable and inconsistent with the Statute. As a result, the Judge properly concluded that there was nothing inherently improper about Jaffe simultaneously holding the positions at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the standard developed by the Judge--whether an objectively reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts and procedures, would question an employee's ability to perform their official duties and act as a manager and/or representative of a labor organization--is an appropriate standard for analyzing whether section 7120(e) has been violated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and/or the Charging Party assert that in applying the objective, reasonable person standard, the Judge improperly considered and relied upon the reasonableness of the agency's actions, the views of OGE, the fact that no employees had filed complaints over a period of years, and the agency's recusal policy. The General Counsel and the Charging Party thus argue that the Judge erred by applying an objective standard in a subjective manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons explained here, we do not find it error for the Judge to have considered the views of the Agency and the Union, the opinion of OGE, and the lack of complaints from the Agency's employees. That this evidence is subjective does not mean that it must be ignored in applying an objective standard. Additionally, it was proper for the Judge to consider steps the Agency had taken to avoid actual or apparent conflicts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that neither the Agency nor the Union viewed the simultaneous holding of these positions as creating an apparent conflict is pertinent on the issue of whether there is in fact an apparent conflict of interest.&#x2003;The Agency and the Union represent an important part of the community <span id="Page_1414"></span>of reasonable persons who might have reason to question Jaffe's ability to simultaneously perform the responsibilities of ethics counselor and union official. OGE's view that there is no conflict of interest here is also probative. As the agency charged with administering the Government's ethics program, OGE has an interest in avoiding the appearance of such conflicts and is uniquely qualified to offer an opinion concerning where conflicts might exist. Lastly, there is no evidence that Agency employees, presumably aware that other individuals have simultaneously served as union officials and ethics counselors for years, have raised accusations of apparent conflicts. This silence by Agency employees, also clearly within the relevant, reasonable person community, is evidence of a lack of an apparent conflict of interest. To be sure, the General Counsel and the Charging Party are correct in asserting that subjective views of the Agency, Union, OGE, as well as the evidence of a lack of complaints from employees, are not determinative for the purposes of applying an objective standard. However, it goes too far to exclude the views of these presumably objective and reasonable persons and entities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the General Counsel points out, in applying the standard, the Judge considered matters occurring more than 6 months prior to the filing of the charges in this case. Specifically, the Judge took note of the fact that no conflict questions had been raised during the years in which Jaffe was an ethics counselor and served in other union-official positions. In arguing that it was error for the Judge to consider this information, the General Counsel cites numerous cases establishing the unchallenged proposition that events occurring more than 6 months prior to the filing of a charge cannot be the subject of a ULP complaint. None of this authority, however, suggests that in evaluating a timely ULP charge and complaint, a Judge may not consider what did or did not happen more than 6 months before the charge was filed. Pertinent authority is, in fact, to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Local</span> <span class="Italic">Lodge No. 1424 v. NLRB</span>, 362 U.S. 411, 416 (1960) (where occurrences within the 6-month limitations period may constitute unfair labor practices, earlier events, occurring outside the limitations period, may shed light on the character of the matters occurring within the limitations period); <span class="Italic">Axelson</span> <span class="Italic">Manufacturing Co.</span>, 88 NLRB 761, 766 (1950) (the statute of limitations does not forbid the introduction of relevant evidence--not occurring within the 6-month period--if that evidence bears on the issue of whether a violation occurred during the 6-month period). Moreover, the Judge in this case did not consider this evidence for the direct purpose of determining whether the Respondents had committed unfair labor practices. Rather, the Judge considered the lack of complaints over a period of years in order to determine whether the employees at the Agency had raised questions concerning the simultaneous holding of these positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It also was not erroneous for the Judge to take note of the steps that the Agency had taken in order to avoid either an actual or apparent conflict of interest.&#x2003;For example, the Judge considered that the Agency had limited the role of ethics counselors to reviewing financial disclosure reports, ethics training, and offering prospective ethics-related advice. Ethics counselors like Jaffe have no program responsibilities and, unlike the designated officials in the Agency General Counsel's Office, do not make ethics determinations or grant waivers. Also, the Judge properly considered the recusal policy in determining whether there was an apparent conflict of interest in this case. Although, as the General Counsel and the Charging Party assert, the recusal policy appears designed to deal with actual rather than apparent conflicts, the existence of a recusal policy serves to assuage concerns over potential conflicts and is properly considered a device designed to dispel appearance of conflict problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, we find that the Judge reasonably considered the views of those in the community involved in analyzing whether a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, would question Jaffe's ability to simultaneously serve in both positions. We also conclude that it was proper for the Judge to consider the steps the Agency had taken to avoid actual or apparent conflicts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On applying the reasonable person standard in this case, the Judge decided that "'no reasonable person with knowledge of the reasonable facts' would conclude that Jaffe's occupying the Chapter presidency and ethics counselor [positions] at the same time would create an apparent conflict of interest." The General Counsel and the Charging Party assert that the Judge's decision is erroneous because he failed to follow the Authority's <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, 6 FLRA 628 decision, relied on inapplicable representation case precedent, improperly afforded deference to OGE's opinion, and blurred the distinction between apparent conflicts of interest and those that are actual or potential.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the General Counsel and the Charging Party assert that the Judge's adopted conclusion in <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, that there was an apparent conflict of interest, dictates a similar determination in this case. In their view, if the dual roles of EEO Counselor and union vice-president present an apparent conflict of interest, then so must simultaneously serving as an agency ethics counselor and local president. The Judge here distinguished <span class="Italic">HEW</span> by relying on two factors: First, the Agency acted reasonably under the circumstances; second, the scenario here is unlike the one presented in <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, and the Agency here did not conclude there was an apparent conflict of interest in holding both positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the reasonableness of the Agency's conduct in analyzing the existence of an apparent conflict of interest is not determinative, the Agency's policies and practices are relevant. In <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, the Judge concluded that the agency had a "policy prohibiting such concurrent office-holding." 6 FLRA at 637. Though not a stated basis for the Judge's finding in <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, the existence of such an agency policy would contribute to--and perhaps even establish--an appearance of a conflict of interest if an employee were allowed to occupy dual positions in violation of such a policy. Here, on the other hand, the Judge found, and it is not disputed, that there was no such policy. To the contrary, it is clear that Jaffe, as well as several other Union officials, openly served as ethics counselors for the Agency. The lack of any prohibition against this practice, along with the fact that it had been an unchallenged custom for years, distinguish this situation from <span class="Italic">HEW</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the Agency concluded that Jaffe's simultaneous service as an ethics counselor and Union official did not present an apparent conflict of interest also distinguishes this case from <span class="Italic">HEW</span>. In <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, the agency required the employee to choose between EEO counselor duties and his position as a union official. Here, the Agency was content to have Jaffe occupy both positions. Moreover, it does not necessarily follow that an apparent conflict created by a union official serving as an EEO counselor would also be present when a union official serves as an ethics advisor. In other words, the EEO counselor and ethics advisor positions are different, as are any apparent conflicts that might arise from serving in these positions while functioning as a union official.[4] As such, the determination that it was not a ULP for the agency in HEW to require a choice between the positions does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that simultaneously occupying the different positions in this case creates an apparent conflict of interest under section 7120(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">HEW</span> the employee was removed from the EEO Counselor position two months after being installed as union vice-president 6 FLRA at 637, so there was no opportunity to either analyze whether the dual positions would lead to complaints or confusion among employees or to obtain the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's views concerning this matter. Here, however, as noted earlier, Agency employees had ample time to complain about the appearance of conflict complaints, but did not, and the OGE opined that there was not an apparent conflict.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These factors rebut the General Counsel's and Charging Party's assertions that Authority precedent dictates a conclusion that there is an apparent conflict of interest here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and the Charging Party object to the Judge's reliance upon Authority representation cases. For example, the Judge noted that as an ethics counselor, Jaffe did not consistently exercise independent judgment and, absent this element, there could be no apparent conflict of interest, citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 32 FLRA 1255 (1988) <span class="Italic">(Office of Chief Counsel</span>). However, the issue in <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> was whether the employee involved, who exercised some supervisory-type responsibilities, could be included in a bargaining unit. On finding that the employee did not consistently exercise independent judgment, the Authority rejected the argument that the employee's inclusion in the unit created a real or apparent conflict of interest. 32 FLRA at 1257, 1260. The Judge also cited <span class="Italic">U.S. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management, Atlanta Regional Office of Federal Investigations</span>, <span class="Italic">Atlanta, Georgia</span>, 48 FLRA 1228 (1993) <span class="Italic">(Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management)</span> where the Authority rejected an argument that including investigators in a bargaining unit created an actual or apparent conflict of interest. In that case the Authority concluded that the employee-investigators seldom investigated employees. 48 FLRA at 1235. The Judge reasoned that even if Jaffe were to investigate a bargaining unit employee, the rarity of such investigations would not be disqualifying.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and the Charging Party are correct that representation decisions are of little, if any import, in determining whether there is an apparent conflict of interest here. <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> and <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span> would be more on point if the dispute concerned whether Jaffe was properly within the bargaining unit. However, citation to representation decisions does not nullify the Judge's conclusion that there was no apparent conflict of interest here. Moreover, the underlying facts relied on by the Judge--that Jaffe's ethics counselor duties do not require the exercise of independent judgment or the investigation of bargaining unit employees--are relevant here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge granted <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to OGE's determination that there was no appearance of conflict of interest, under the Government-wide ethics regulations, as a result of Jaffe's dual status as both a union official and an ethics counselor. Both the General Counsel and the Charging Party object to the Judge's taking notice of the OGE opinion, arguing that it should not have been considered. Both are correct in asserting that OGE's view of what is an apparent conflict under section 7120(e) is not <span id="Page_1415"></span>entitled to deference. However, we conclude that the Judge only deferred to OGE's opinion concerning the regulation it administers 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2600 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. The Judge merely considered OGE's position on Jaffe's dual status as "further evidence that her duties do not create an apparent conflict of interest within the meaning of section 7120(e) of the Statute." We discern no error here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the potential for a conflict does not equate to an apparent conflict in this case.&#x2003;In support of this conclusion, the Judge relied upon Jaffe's testimony that she clarifies the capacity in which her advice or assistance is being sought, the existence of the recusal policy, the limited function of ethics counselors, the relatively few disciplinary actions taken against Agency employees for ethics-related matters, and the fact that there have been no conflict of interest challenges against Jaffe.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and the Charging Party argue that the Judge should have considered the potential for conflicts in analyzing whether there was an apparent conflict.&#x2003;They assert that if there is a significant potential for a conflict, then there is, in fact, an apparent conflict.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The potential for conflicts of interests was appropriately considered by the Judge in analyzing whether a reasonable person would question Jaffe's ability to simultaneously hold both positions. If, as the General Counsel and the Charging Party assert, there was a high likelihood that conflicts might occur, this would suggest that there was, in fact, an apparent conflict. However, the Judge determined that the chance of conflicts developing was remote given Jaffe's clarification of the capacity in which her advice or assistance was being sought, the limited role of the Agency's ethics counselors, the relatively few ethics-related disciplinary actions at the Agency, and the fact that there had been no complaints concerning Jaffe's dual roles. The Judge went on to point out that if a conflict did occur it would be addressed by the recusal policy. The Judge's conclusions in this regard are reasonable and supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, OWCP San Francisco and AFGE Local 2391</span>, 61 FLRA 784, 784-86 (2006), decided that an agency properly precluded one employee, an OWCP claims examiner, from representing another unit employee in an FECA claim in the office responsible for FECA adjudication. The Labor Department had concluded that as a representative, the employee became an advocate in the same program where she adjudicated claims, and that activity could be properly barred under 5 USC 7120:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department of Labor's Office of Worker's Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Federal Government-wide FECA claims program. The employee, a Union Steward who is also an OWCP FECA claims examiner in the Respondent's San Francisco District Office, had been representing a co-worker (the claimant) regarding the claimant's FECA claim. The OWCP has a long-standing policy of adjudicating at just one office (the Kansas City Regional Office) those FECA claims from Department of Labor employees, and not allowing OWCP employees to represent anyone other than themselves in FECA proceedings. When it came to the attention of Respondent's Regional Director that the employee was representing the co-worker claimant in the claimant's FECA claim, the Regional Director ordered the employee to discontinue her representational activity of the claimant. The Respondent never filed a conflict of interest claim against the employee based upon this conduct. The employee terminated her representation of the claimant and the unfair labor practice claim here ensued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Judge set forth the standard for analyzing whether &#x00A7; 7120[2] of the Statute had been violated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">whether an objectively reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts and procedures, would question an employee's ability to perform their official duties and act as a manager and/or representative of a labor organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Section 7120(e) of the Statute provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">This chapter does not authorize participation in the management of a labor organization or acting as a representative of a labor organization by a management official, a supervisor, or a confidential employee, except as specifically provided in this chapter, or by an employee if the participation or activity would result in a conflict or apparent conflict of interest or would otherwise be incompatible with law or with the official duties of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See </span>Judge's Decision at 17<span class="Italic"> (citing NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1541, 1549 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Bernsen</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge then discussed relevant Authority precedent, including <span class="Italic">Cong. Research Employees Ass'n, IFPTE, Local 75</span>, 59 FLRA 994 (2004) (<span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>). In that case, the agency reassigned a research project concerning collective bargaining from an employee, who was also the union president, stating that its research product needed to be above criticism and any apparent conflict of interest to maintain its impartial public reputation. The Authority found that there was an apparent conflict of interest under &#x00A7; 7120(e) and that the agency was within its rights to reassign the work at issue. The Judge also discussed <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Serv., Nat'l Office</span>, 41 FLRA 402 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, an attorney, who was also the union vice president and steward, was told to stop representing an employee in an equal employment opportunity (EEO) matter. In that case, the Authority found no violation of &#x00A7; 7120 because the attorney's duties were not related to the EEO program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge applied the <span class="Italic">Bernsen</span> standard and precedent to the case facts and found that the Agency's actions did not constitute an unfair labor practice. The Judge determined that the Agency had a legitimate interest in seeking to ensure that the processing of FECA claims is objective and fair. The Judge found that the employee's representational activities meant "she became an advocate in the same program where she adjudicates claims." The Judge further found that the employee's representational activities were "directly related to the work she does as a claims examiner[.]" Because of this relationship between the representational activities and the employee's work duties, the Judge determined that this case was distinguishable from <span class="Italic">IRS</span> but was similar to <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>. Therefore, and consistent with <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, the Judge found a conflict between the employee's "ability to perform her official duties and to act as union representative in this matter." Thus, the Judge concluded that the complaint should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bernsen</span>, the Authority articulated its analytical framework for determining whether certain conduct violates &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute. Under that framework, the Authority examines whether an objectively reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts and procedures, would question an employee's ability to perform his/her official duties and act as a manager and/or representative of a labor organization. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bernsen</span>, 53 FLRA at 1549.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the Respondent did not violate &#x00A7; 7120(e)--and thus &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1)--by refusing to let the employee here represent the claimant in her FECA claim before the Respondent. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Judge correctly found that the Respondent did not violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching her decision, the Judge discussed the Authority's holdings in <span class="Italic">IFPTE </span>and <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the record and the parties' arguments. In explaining her conclusion, the Judge noted that the Respondent has a "legitimate interest in seeking to ensure that its processing of FECA claims is objective and fair and that it is free of any suggestion that is otherwise." The Judge went on to note that the Respondent has taken specific steps to determine how FECA claims by the Respondent's employees would be processed, to ensure "that the process be objective and fair."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the union representation work being done by the employee here was "directly related to the work she does as a claims examiner for OWCP." According to the Judge, the circumstances here were distinguishable from <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, because the union representative here was advocating employee interests in the "same program where [the union representative] adjudicates claims." The Judge determined that the factual circumstances here were similar to the facts set found in <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>. The Judge concluded, based on the foregoing, that there was a conflict between the union representative's ability to perform her official duties and to act as a union representative in this matter, and found that the Respondent had not violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the union representative's representational activities directly relate to the union representative's regular job duties, we conclude in agreement with the Judge that there is a conflict between the union representative's ability to perform his or her official duties and to act as a union representative. Additionally, and as also reflected in <span class="Italic">IFPTE,</span> we agree with the Judge that the Respondent has a legitimate interest in ensuring that its procedure for processing FECA claims for its own employees is "objective and fair and that it is free of any suggestion that is otherwise." Under the circumstances presented here, we conclude the Respondent did not violate &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute by limiting the ability of the employee here to represent the claimant in her FECA claim before the Respondent. Consequently, the Respondent did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency seeks to bar a supervisor from becoming actively involved in union activities as a union official, and the agency does so by reassigning the employee out of the position that the agency characterizes as supervisory for the purpose of avoiding a perceived conflict of interest on the part of the union official, the determination by FLRA that the employee was not a supervisor leaves the agency in the position of having committed a ULP, <span class="Italic">SSA OHA and Ass'n of ALJs, IFPTE</span>, 59 FLRA 716, 719-20 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise of any right provided by the Statute. Section 7102 of the Statute sets forth certain employee rights including the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal and that each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such <span id="Page_1416"></span>right. Such right includes the right to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative. Section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The framework for resolving complaints of alleged discrimination under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 117-123, and its progeny. Under this framework, the General Counsel must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. If the General Counsel presents a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of unlawful<span class="Italic"> </span>discrimination, the Respondent has the burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, as an affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity<span class="Italic">. Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Warner Robins Air Force Base, Georgia</span>, 52 FLRA 602, 605 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, the FLRA ALJ found that the General Counsel had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Respondent had violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by removing this Judge from the position of Acting HOCALJ because of her status as an officer of the Union. The FLRA ALJ found that the General Counsel satisfied the threshold burden of showing that consideration of the Judge's status as a Union officer was a motivating factor in the Respondent's removal of the Judge. The Respondent does not dispute the FLRA ALJ's finding, which we adopt, that the Judge's status as a Union officer was a motivating factor in its decision to remove her from the position. Rather, the Respondent takes issue with the FLRA ALJ's rejection of its affirmative defense that there was legitimate justification for the action. According to the Respondent, in her capacity as Acting HOCALJ, the Judge was a supervisor. The Respondent argues, therefore, that it demonstrated a legitimate justification for its action because an actual or perceived conflict of interest was posed by her acting as a supervisor while also serving as Vice President of the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute, "management officials, supervisors, and confidential employees are expressly prohibited from participating in the management of a labor organization." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, 913th Air </span>Wing<span class="Italic">, Willow Grove Air Reserve Station, Pennsylvania</span>, 58 FLRA 516, 518 (2003). In the instant case, the FLRA ALJ's factual findings show that as Acting HOCALJ, the Judge served as a "temporary stand-in for the HOCALJ." It is also uncontroverted that in the approximately seven years that she served in this capacity, "she never had to represent the Respondent in a labor relations matter and only once informally reprimanded an ALJ." The FLRA ALJ's factual findings further reveal that this Judge's activities as Acting HOCALJ generally involved signing leave requests and time sheets and occasionally participating in conference calls; more sensitive matters "could be referred to the Regional Office or could await [the HOCALJ's] return."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These findings show that this Judge's duties as Acting HOCALJ were more routine in nature and did not require the consistent exercise of independent judgment<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">General Services Admin., Region 2, New York, New York</span>, 54 FLRA 864, 874-77 (1998) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>) (record established that employee did not exercise any supervisory authority and, therefore, employee was not a supervisor; <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, </span>53 FLRA 1541, 1553 (1998)<span class="Italic"> (NTEU</span>) (ethics counselor's duties did not require the exercise of independent judgment; <span class="Italic">United States Small Business Administration District Office, Casper, Wyoming,</span> 49 FLRA 1051, 1060 (1994) (team leader was not a supervisor, despite the fact that he had issued a warning letter to an employee). Accordingly, because the FLRA ALJ's factual findings demonstrate that this Judge's duties as Acting HOCALJ did not require the consistent exercise of independent judgment, she was not a supervisor within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute and, therefore, no conflict of interest under &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute could occur on this basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor is there any other basis for finding that a conflict or apparent conflict of interest exists in this case because of the employee's status as a Union officer and the duties she performed as a "temporary stand-in" for the HOCALJ. As the FLRA ALJ found, the Respondent has failed to establish that this Judge's status as a Union officer was inconsistent with the performance of her duties as Acting HOCALJ, which were temporary and during which she never represented management in a labor relations matter and sensitive matters could be referred to the Regional Office or could await the HOCALJ's return. Also, the fact that the Judge signed leave requests while serving as Acting HOCALJ does not, in itself, establish that the Judge was acting in the capacity of a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 54 FLRA at 877 (the exercise of authority to disapprove/approve leave requests does not, itself, establish that an individual is a supervisor). Under these particular circumstances, the Respondent has not established that a conflict or apparent conflict of interest existed. Accordingly, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate a legitimate justification for its action in removing the Judge from the Acting HOCALJ position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also noted that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, 6 FLRA at 638, where the Authority found that an agency did not violate the Statute by terminating the appointment of a union vice president as an equal employment opportunity officer. In that case, the Authority noted no evidence of anti-union motivation, the legitimacy of the anticipated conflict of interest based on the duties of the dual positions was clear, and agency policy precluded high ranking union officials from serving as an EEO counselor. Unlike <span class="Italic">HEW</span>, there is no agency policy precluding union officials from serving in the disputed position in this case, nor has the Respondent pointed to anything in the record that demonstrates a clear inherent conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union could pursue through arbitration a claim for compensation of a unit employee who became a supervisor prior to the arbitration hearing, but after the operative events. There was no improper conflict of interest on the part of the union. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 99</span>, 11 FLRA 486, 487 (1983).
