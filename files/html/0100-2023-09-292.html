<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-289"><span class="space">a.</span> Due Process Considerations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability to secure evidence may have due process considerations. A Customs and Border Protection Officer was removed for lack of ability to carry a firearm based on psychiatric fitness for duty exams. The matter went to a labor arbitrator, who affirmed the removal. During the arbitration, the union requested a copy of a psychologist's report that was relied on by the examining psychiatrists. Discovery is ordinarily not available in arbitration. The union requested the material under 5 USC 7114, a statute that requires management to release to the union information material to a grievance, a process that might be likened to a document request under MSPB regulations. The agency did not provide the report, explaining that the report was not in the agency's possession. The Federal Circuit remanded the case with direction that the arbitrator order the agency to provide the grievant or his union the documentation and evaluation assembled by the psychologist. Availability of that information was a matter of due process that possibly could be cured by post-termination proceedings. Denial of the material requested by the union required only a remand without automatic reinstatement of the grievant. The parties and the arbitrator would have to ascertain if the requested material was available, if so, what to make of it when the parties addressed its significance and, if the material was not available, what the consequence would be for the termination action, <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200915171">975 F.3d 1342</a>, 1349-54 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (Judge Bryson concurring):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether Mr. Ramirez was afforded due process in challenging the basis for his removal in light of the Agency's refusal to provide him with access to the records of his MMPI assessments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, public employees possess a constitutionally protected property right in their employment and are entitled to due process at each stage of their removal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp</span>., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374-76 (Fed. Cir. 1999). "The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546. The precise requirements of due process in each case are not "wooden absolutes" and must be judged according to the demands of the particular situation. <span class="Italic">See Morrissey v. Brewer</span>, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972); <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Thomas</span>, 430 F.2d 852, 856 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the process due to an individual in a given context, a court must consider (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). At the same time, the courts have recognized that one "relatively immutable" principle of due process is that "where governmental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact findings, the evidence used to prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue." <span class="Italic">Greene v. McElroy</span>, 360 U.S. 474, 496 (1959); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Comm'r of Soc</span>., 909 F.3d 786, 797 (6th Cir. 2018); <span class="Italic">see also ASSE Int'l, Inc. v. Kerry</span>, 803 F.3d 1059, 1076 (9th Cir. 2015) (acknowledging that "fundamental fairness--the touchstone to determining whether a plaintiff received due process--requires that a party against whom an agency has proceeded be allowed to rebut evidence offered by the agency if that evidence is relevant." (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has not previously decided whether and when due process requires a government agency to provide its employee with the records of psychological testing underlying an adverse fitness-for-duty evaluation that leads to the employee's removal. In comparable circumstances, the Fifth Circuit has held that when a government agency removes its employees based on drug charges established through urinalysis, due process requires that the employees have access to samples of the <span id="Page_1275"></span>urinalysis for independent verification. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Fed. Aviation Admin</span>., 687 F.2d 92, 94-96 (5th Cir. 1982). In <span class="Italic">Houston Federation of Teachers, Local 2415 v. Houston Independent School District</span>, the district court relied on the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Banks</span> in concluding that a school district violates the due process rights of its teachers when it bases retention decisions on the results of a proprietary assessment without providing the teachers with any opportunity to review and assess the accuracy and validity of the testing data and methodology. 251 F. Supp.3d 1168, 1178-80 (S.D. Tex. 2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reach a similar conclusion when we assess the evidence at issue in this case in light of the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors and the "immutable" principle of due process announced in <span class="Italic">Greene</span>. Here, the record makes plain that the Agency's removal of Mr. Ramirez was based on Dr. Nahmias's recommendation that he be restricted from carrying a firearm. That recommendation was in turn based primarily, if not exclusively, on Dr. Frederick's interpretation of the MMPI results as invalid for defensiveness. Thus, the soundness of Dr. Frederick's interpretation was critical to the question of whether the Agency had just cause to remove Mr. Ramirez. Dr. Nahmias's recommendation, and the Agency's removal decision, rested on the assumption that Dr. Frederick tabulated the scores correctly and that he applied the appropriate criteria in interpreting the scores. The only way for Mr. Ramirez to verify or challenge those assumptions was to independently review the tests and their interpretation by Dr. Frederick.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against the critical role of the MMPI records for protecting against wrongful deprivation, the Agency made no showing that it would have been unduly burdensome to obtain and produce those records. There is no record that the Agency even inquired into the possibility of doing so here. While in some instances, "the government's failure to preserve and produce such relevant and material evidence might be excusable upon a showing of good faith and reasonable effort," the fact that the Agency made "no attempt" to obtain the evidence at issue undermines any such conclusion in this case. <span class="Italic">See Banks</span>, 687 F.2d at 96. As the Fifth Circuit recognized in <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, it may be difficult at times to "mark an exact balance between relevance and the attendant procedural burdens in an administrative proceeding"; however, "even the most rudimentary standards of due process" would afford an employee the opportunity to access and meaningfully challenge the critical and dispositive pieces of evidence asserted against him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying Mr. Ramirez's request to order production of the MMPI records, the arbitrator relied on the following reasoning: (1) that the records were not in the Agency's custody, and thus the Agency had no regulatory or contractual obligation to produce them; (2) that the Agency itself did not directly review or consider the records in making its removal decision; (3) that Mr. Ramirez had the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Nahmias and to present testimony from his own expert; and (4) that two other psychiatrists, Dr. Skop and Dr. Yi, generally concurred with Dr. Nahmias's findings. None of these grounds undermines Mr. Ramirez's due process rights to the records at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">First</span>, as a government entity defending its decision to deprive an employee of protected employment, the Agency's obligation to provide Mr. Ramirez with the evidence underlying its decision stems from more than its regulatory and contractual obligations for collective bargaining with his union.[3] Rather, the minimum requirements are constitutional. In <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, the court rejected the FAA's contention that "since it was not in possession of the samples, it was under no duty to preserve or order the control of the samples." <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, 687 F.2d at 95. The fact that the Agency contracted for the testing and relied upon it, together with the foreseeable importance of the evidence at issue to the employee's defense, obligated the Agency to make the evidence available for independent examination by the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;While the arbitrator did not identify any specific "[r]egulations" that he reviewed in concluding the Agency was not obligated to produce the MMPI records, the Agency had based its arguments on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b), which provides that as part of good faith negotiations with a union, the agency need only provide the union representative with relevant information "normally maintained by the agency in the regular course of business."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Second</span>, the fact that the Agency relied indirectly rather than directly on the evidence at issue did not excuse the Agency from making the evidence available to Mr. Ramirez. As the Sixth Circuit recognized in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, an agency's determination "depends on fact findings beyond the ultimate factual question at issue, and due process protects a person's right to contest" the basis for the preliminary findings that underlie the agency's ultimate determination. 909 F.3d at 798 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Agency's conclusion that Mr. Ramirez was unfit for duty depended on the preliminary finding that he was defensive and uncooperative in completing his MMPI assessments. The Agency cannot shield the evidence underlying that finding from production by simply relaying it through the report of another expert.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Third</span>, the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Nahmias regarding his reliance on the MMPI results did not satisfy Mr. Ramirez's right to independently review and challenge the results directly. Even if Dr. Nahmias could be questioned on his understanding of the general reliability of MMPI assessments, he did not oversee Dr. Frederick's interpretation of Mr. Ramirez's MMPI assessments and thus could not opine as to whether Dr. Frederick tabulated the responses accurately or interpreted them according to appropriate criteria--questions that are critical to the propriety of the Agency's removal decision in this case. Similarly, while Mr. Ramirez's own expert, Dr. Puente, could administer and interpret a new MMPI assessment according to his own criteria, his interpretation could not address--and indeed rendered all the more material--the question of what methods and standards Dr. Frederick applied in reaching the interpretations that were relied upon by the Agency's experts and the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fourth</span>, these concerns were not alleviated by the concurring opinions of the three evaluating psychiatrists. All of them relied on the interpretation of Dr. Frederick for their analysis, and none of them independently assessed his work. The repeated evaluations did nothing to diminish the likelihood of a fundamental error in Dr. Frederick's analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contending that Mr. Ramirez was nonetheless afforded adequate process, the Agency raises one additional argument not addressed by the arbitrator: that Mr. Ramirez could have tried to obtain the records himself from Dr. Nahmias or Dr. Frederick. We are unpersuaded. While in certain contexts, an individual who fails to avail himself of established procedures for obtaining evidence is precluded from later complaining about his lack of access to that evidence, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Richardson v. Perales</span>, 402 U.S. 389, 405 (1971), there was no reasonable expectation here that Mr. Ramirez would have been able to obtain the MMPI records without the Agency's cooperation. Neither Dr. Nahmias nor Dr. Frederick had a treating relationship with Mr. Ramirez; they were engaged for the purpose of responding to the Agency's inquiries. Moreover, the Agency points to no process by which Mr. Ramirez could have compelled records from these third parties in time for independent review in advance of a hearing. <span class="Italic">Cf. CVS Health Corp. v. Vividus</span>, LLC, 878 F.3d 703, 706-07 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that a district court is not permitted under section 7 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7, to enforce an arbitrator's order compelling pre-hearing document discovery from a non-party to the arbitration). Thus, the mere fact that Mr. Ramirez could have <span class="Italic">asked</span> Dr. Nahmias and Dr. Frederick to provide the MMPI records, with no way of obligating them to so, does not relieve the Agency of its obligation to produce the evidence that formed the basis for its removal decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, the arbitrator legally erred in concluding that Mr. Ramirez lacked a due process right to review and challenge the records of the MMPI assessments underlying the Agency's removal decision. Because Mr. Ramirez was denied this right during arbitration, the Final Award must be vacated, and the case remanded to provide Mr. Ramirez with the process he was owed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not, however, agree with Mr. Ramirez that we must also vacate the Agency's removal decision and order reinstatement with back pay because he was constitutionally entitled to receive his MMPI records <span class="Italic">before his removal</span>. For one, there is nothing in the record indicating that Mr. Ramirez pressed his request for his MMPI records during pre-removal agency proceedings. The parties also did not submit for arbitration the question of whether, independent of the merits of the Agency's decision, deficiencies in the Agency's pre-removal process constituted a basis for overturning his removal. Nor is there any other indication in the record on appeal that Mr. Ramirez briefed or otherwise asserted this argument before the arbitrator. Rather, the record only shows that he objected to the Agency's introduction of evidence relying on the MMPI records when he had no access to them and requested an order for the Agency to produce them for independent review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded that the Agency's failure to provide Mr. Ramirez with his MMPI records before his termination constituted a constitutional violation that cannot be remedied through adequate post-termination procedures. The Supreme Court has recognized that post-termination proceedings may adequately protect a government employee's interest in tenured employment. <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546-547. When a full post-termination hearing is available, pre-termination proceedings "need not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge," and should only serve as "an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 545-46. This includes oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to present his side of the story. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To require more than this before termination "would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 546; <span class="Italic">see also Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1375-76. While we have held that certain due process deficiencies in pre-removal proceedings, such as <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, warrant vacating the removal proceedings in their entirety, such violations must be "so substantial and so likely to <span id="Page_1276"></span>cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, before Mr. Ramirez was terminated, he was notified of the Agency's proposal to remove him based on the conclusions of his psychiatric evaluations, and he had received the reports of these evaluations, which informed him that they relied on MMPI results that neither he nor the Agency had reviewed first-hand. That information explained the basis for the Agency's decision and allowed him to challenge that decision by pointing out ways in which the underlying evidence may have been unreliable. While he was ultimately entitled to independently review the MMPI results with the assistance of his own expert to test their validity and reliability, the fact that he was unable to do so during the preliminary pre-removal proceedings is not "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice" as to independently justify vacating the removal decision, so long as he is ultimately afforded an opportunity to do so during post-removal arbitration. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we hold that when an agency relies, directly or indirectly, on the results of a psychological assessment in justifying an employee's removal, the agency must provide the employee with a meaningful opportunity to review and challenge the data, analysis, and results of that assessment. Because Mr. Ramirez was denied this opportunity, the Final Award must be vacated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not address here the question of what remedies would be acceptable should the parties discover, upon remand, that the relevant records are no longer available. That would be an assessment to be made by the arbitrator in the first instance, should the need arise. While, as the concurrence notes, the considerations set forth in <span class="Italic">California v. Trombetta</span>, 467 U.S. 479 (1984), may provide some guidance on the requirements and remedies of due process where relevant evidence is destroyed, there are critical distinctions between this case and <span class="Italic">Trombetta</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, in concluding that the missing breath samples in <span class="Italic">Trombetta</span> were unlikely to be exculpatory, the Court relied on the fact that the breathalyzer used in the analysis had been widely validated for accuracy in assessing blood alcohol levels and that the error rates were known to be low. <span class="Italic">See</span> 467 U.S. at 490. Here, there is no evidence in the record that the validity scales of the MMPI test have ever been scientifically validated to show how often, and under what circumstances, "defensiveness"-based invalidity is a reliable indicator of willful uncooperativeness that warrants an adverse inference as to a person's psychiatric fitness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in <span class="Italic">Trombetta</span>, the defendants had access to the most pertinent evidence concerning the most likely sources of error in the breath analysis: for calibration errors, inspection of the machine and calibration logs; for external radio and chemical interference, investigation of external sources of radio waves and the dieting state of the defendants; for operator error, cross-examination of the police officers who administered the test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the record indicates that one of the most likely sources of error in Dr. Frederick's interpretation is the possibility that he used a validity range that did not account for the typical scores found among law enforcement officers. Yet, Mr. Ramirez had no way to determine what numerical criteria Dr. Frederick applied in reaching his interpretations of MMPI responses at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, <span class="Italic">Trombetta</span> was decided in a context where a retrial with adequate government disclosures was not possible, and a recognized due process violation could only be remedied by barring further prosecution of a crime or suppressing the state's most probative evidence--"troubling choices" that would likely allow an alleged crime to go unprosecuted and a potentially dangerous individual to go free. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 486-87. Here, the basis for Mr. Ramirez's removal was not any alleged crime or misconduct, but failure to maintain a condition of employment. Reinstatement in this case does not preclude the Agency from ensuring that its weapons-carrying employees are fit for duty. If the MMPI records are unavailable and the arbitrator determines that reinstatement is the only acceptable remedy, then the Agency can reevaluate Mr. Ramirez's fitness immediately upon reinstatement. At that point, the Agency can remove him again with adequate process, if the evidence warrants doing so, without ever putting a gun back in his hand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the parties' remaining arguments and find them to be either waived or without merit. For the reasons discussed, we vacate the arbitrator's Final Award and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the arbitrator must order the Agency to provide Mr. Ramirez or his designated agent with access to the records of his MMPI assessments, including the assessments themselves, his responses, and Dr. Frederick's interpretations. The arbitrator must also provide Mr. Ramirez with an opportunity to present new evidence and testimony at a hearing concerning these records, and all evidence must be considered before issuing a new award.</p>
