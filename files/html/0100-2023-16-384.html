<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-384"><span class="space">1.</span> Nontraditional Remedies</h4>
<p class="noindent">A "nontraditional" remedy for a ULP may be employed when "traditional" remedies are inadequate. A nontraditional remedy might be appropriate to remedy a pattern of violations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council Local 2544</span>, 58 FLRA 656, 661 (2003). If the General Counsel seeks a nontraditional remedy, the burden of proof is on the General Counsel to justify its issuance, <span class="Italic">F. E. Warren AFB and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 161 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has developed several "traditional" remedies, including a cease-and-desist order accompanied by the posting of a notice to employees, which are provided in virtually all cases where a violation is found. Other remedies requiring some form of affirmative action by the respondent have also become established, including, as examples, a retroactive bargaining order, the grant of back pay, and the release of improperly withheld information. In some cases, these remedies have given rise to criteria of their own. <span class="Italic">E.g., Federal Correctional Institution</span>, 8 FLRA 604 (1982) (setting criteria for <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedies where respondent failed to bargain over impact and implementation of a change); <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 41 FLRA 272, 279 (1991) (setting standard for <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy where respondent failed to bargain over substance of a change).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that nontraditional remedies, such as the memorandum proposed by the General Counsel in this case, must satisfy the same broad objectives that the Authority described in <span class="Italic">Safford</span>. That is, assuming that there exist no legal or public policy objections to a proposed, nontraditional remedy, the questions are whether the remedy is reasonably necessary and would be effective to "recreate the conditions and relationships" with which the unfair labor practice interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct<span class="Italic">. Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 444-45. These questions are essentially factual. As such, they should be argued and resolved in essentially the same fashion as other factual questions brought before us. As with other factual questions, the General Counsel bears the burden of persuasion, and the Judge is responsible for initially determining whether the remedy is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Ind. Union of Pension Employees for Democracy &#x0026; Justice and PBGC</span>, 70 FLRA 820, 827 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">Ind. Union of Pension Employees for Democracy &#x0026; Justice and PBGC</span>, 71 FLRA 60 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Ind. Union of Pension Employees for Democracy &#x0026; Justice v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/indep-union-of-pension-emps-for-democracy-justice-v-fed-labor-relations-auth">961 F.3d 490</a> (D.C. Cir. 2020)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A nontraditional remedy is appropriate where--assuming no legal or public policy objections are present--the remedy is reasonably necessary and would be effective to recreate the conditions and relationships with which the ULP interfered as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct.[79] While post-charge conduct is irrelevant in determining whether a party violated the Statute, it is permissible to consider post-charge events in order to remedy the harm that results from pre-charge activities.[80]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge found no violation in terms of the Union's actions with Arbitrators Foster and Strongin, we agree that they should be excluded from the remedy. However, the Judge did find a violation in terms of the Union's actions with Arbitrator Conway. Although Arbitrator Conway's resignation occurred after the filing of the charge, we consider that evidence in order to remedy the harm resulting from the Union's pre-charge activities.[82] Consequently, we grant, in part, the Agency's exception and extend the remedy to include offering Arbitrator Conway an opportunity to rejoin the arbitration pool.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Judge erred in granting any nontraditional remedy because the Agency had unclean hands.&#x2003;Under the doctrine of clean hands, if a party comes before a court for relief, that court can deny equitable relief where that party is tainted with bad faith relative to the mater in which it seeks relief.[84] That doctrine does not apply here. The Union points to many alleged actions[85] unrelated to the misconduct at issue, and therefore irrelevant.[86] The Union likewise raised unrelated issues concerning the GC that are equally irrelevant.[88]</p>

<p class="noindent">Nontraditional remedies including supervisory training and naming of specific supervisors in postings were rejected in <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, OIA and AFGE Local 709</span>, 54 FLRA 1502, 1515-18 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to nation-wide posting of the notice as a remedy, the General Counsel attaches a recommended notice containing the personal name of the chief of the OIA, and requests training for OIA and Federal Correctional Institute Englewood officials and agents to be conducted by individuals from outside of the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously addressed the remedies it will grant in unfair labor practice cases.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona</span>, 52 FLRA 182, 184-87 (1996) (<span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span>); <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2354</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 160-62 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Warren</span>). In <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, the Authority discussed its approach to evaluating requests for nontraditional remedies, and concluded that such remedies must satisfy the same broad objectives that the Authority described in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Safford, Arizona and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2313</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 444-45 (1990) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>). "That is, assuming that there [are] no legal or public policy objections to a proposed, nontraditional remedy, the questions are whether the remedy is reasonably necessary and would be effective to 'recreate the conditions and relationships' with which the unfair labor practice interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct." <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 161 (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 35 FLRA at 444-45). The Authority also determined that "[a]s these questions are essentially factual, we evaluate them, as we do other factual questions, by considering the record evidence, arguments to the Judge, and any exceptions to the Judge's decision." <span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span>, 52 FLRA at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span>, the Authority applied the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standards and rejected a requested remedy substantially similar to the requested remedy here. In <span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span>, the Authority held that conducting a formal discussion with unit employees without giving the union notice and an opportunity to be represented violated the Statute. The Authority rejected the General Counsel's request to order that supervisors be trained in the obligations of VA management under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, and that such training be provided by an agency other than VA. The Authority also rejected the argument that because supervisors ignored Authority precedent, they are likely to continue to do so. In this regard, the Authority found that the "facts and circumstances do not establish that the supervisors' actions were based on their ignorance of obligations under the Statute or that, for any other reason, training of the supervisors is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute." <span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span>, 52 FLRA at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span> took note that the state of the law was not settled when the violation took place; the agency was awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit of Authority precedent. The Ninth Circuit subsequently affirmed the Authority and the VA asserted that it had since followed the law. The Authority concluded that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under the approach adopted in <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, the record does not establish that requiring the supervisors to undergo training, even if they are likely to conduct interviews of the type found to constitute a formal discussion in this case, is reasonably necessary and would be effective to create conditions and relationships with which the violation interfered or to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority also found that the General Counsel had not shown that the proposed training was necessary, or that it could only properly be done by another agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span> also rejected the General Counsel's arguments based on the Authority's upholding of arbitrators' remedies in <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> and <span class="Italic">Lewisburg</span>, stating that these "decisions do not support a conclusion that training should be required as a remedy in unfair labor practice cases." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 185.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel relies on the Authority's order of training in arbitration cases in support of its request for training in the Statute here. Further, the General Counsel argues that nationwide training is appropriate because the Respondents' arguments--that a witness should be absolutely precluded from serving as a union representative, and that the heightened security practices in a correctional facility warrant absolute preclusion--demonstrate the failure to acknowledge section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the General Counsel's request for training in the Statute, as we did in <span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span>. The General Counsel has not demonstrated why the remedy is reasonably necessary, how the remedy would effectively recreate the conditions and relationships with which the unfair labor practice interfered, how the policies of the Statute would be effectuated, or how future violative conduct would be deterred. The fact that the Respondents argued in favor of absolutely precluding the witness from serving as the union's representative does not mean that the Respondents fail to recognize their obligations under the Statute, such that training would likely prevent future violations. The Respondents' recognition of their obligations under the Statute is shown by their allowing the Union to designate another individual to serve as Union representative and continuing with the interview. Finally, their reliance on the heightened security risks in a correctional institution to support an absolute preclusion standard also does not demonstrate that training is necessary. Therefore, based on the record evidence, arguments to the Judge, and the General Counsel's exceptions, we affirm the Judge's decision not to direct Agency-wide training regarding <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the argument that the order and notice should identify by name the chief of OIA. In <span class="Italic">VA Phoenix</span> the Authority rejected a request that the names of the supervisors responsible for the unfair labor practices appear in the notice to employees. The Authority found that "no authority is cited or apparent for concluding that individuals are named in private-sector notices," and noted one case in which an Authority judge denied such a request. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 185 n.5. The Authority also found that "[b]ased on our application of <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, we conclude that this remedy, too, is not necessary to effectuate the legal and policy objectives to be achieved by the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 187. We reach a similar conclusion here, as the General Counsel has made no argument and cited no precedent warranting the naming of a particular individual in the order and notice. Therefore, we will identify the agency official by position but not by name in the order and notice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Until the decision was overruled in 2014, FLRA disapproved an order that the agency post a remedial notice on its television monitors and through the email system. The record did not demonstrate that the nontraditional positing was <span id="page_1658"></span>necessary to recreate conditions and relationships or that it would otherwise effectuate statutory purposes. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Florence and AFGE Local 1300</span>, 59 FLRA 165 (2003). But <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FTC Oklahoma City and AFGE Local 171</span>, 67 FLRA 221, 222-26 (2014), arrived at a different result, overruling <span class="Italic">FCI Florence</span> and approving emailed notices of ULP violations. [<span class="Italic">FTC Oklahoma City</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-389.html#sec8-388">Email Notices to Employees</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and AFGE Local 2640</span>, 54 FLRA 987, 1022 (1998), addressed a request that a supervisor be disciplined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel has requested that the Authority issue an order that goes beyond the traditional remedies.&#x2003;First, the General Counsel requests that Respondent's officials, specifically Anthony-Jung's supervisor, the Distribution Branch Chief and the R&#x0026;T Staff Chief, be disciplined. We agree with the Judge that the General Counsel has not established the need for disciplining the supervisors. As the Judge found, restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> was sufficient because the ULPs were directed at one individual and were not widespread, the supervisors were not defiant of prior Authority orders, and the violations were not flagrant. Moreover, the factual circumstances of this case do not establish a need for that remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Respondent contends that the Authority is prohibited, as a matter of law, from ordering the discipline of agency officials. Because we find that such a remedy would not be warranted in the circumstances of this case, we need not reach that question here.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">US Penitentiary, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 919</span>, 55 FLRA 704, 719-20 (1999), determined to be appropriate referral to the Office of Special Counsel of a prison official who threatened union officials:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel requests that the Respondent be required to place a nondisciplinary entry in the warden's personnel file, indicating that he was found to have violated the Statute. As the unfair labor charges were filed against the Respondent as an <span class="Italic">agency</span>--i.e., the warden was not named as a party to these cases--the warden was not represented at the hearing, or placed on notice that future disciplinary actions against him might be affected by the Authority's decision. The warden did not have the same opportunity to defend himself before the Judge that he would have had if he had received such notice. Given this, granting the remedy requested by the GC raises substantial due process considerations. We note that the Authority has declined to award a similar remedy in the past. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Penitentiary, Florence,</span> <span class="Italic">Colorado, </span>53 FLRA 1393, 1394 (1998) <span class="Italic">(USP Florence). </span>We decline to do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, taking into account the egregious nature of the warden's behavior, we believe that further action may be appropriate. Actions taken, or threatened to be taken, against employees based on their protected representational activities may constitute prohibited personnel practices. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), it is a prohibited personnel practice to, <span class="Italic">inter alia, </span>"threaten to take...any personnel action against any employee or applicant because of--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Merit Systems Protection Board has held, in this regard, that Union representation of employees in the agency's appeal processes constitute protected activities under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">See Bodinus v. Department of the Treasury, </span>7 MSPR 536 (1981). Further, a "personnel action" includes "an action under chapter 75 of [title 5]," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), and one type of action under chapter 75 of title 5 is "a removal." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(l).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Case No.&#x2003;DE-CA-60569, the warden threatened the second VP with removal for, <span class="Italic">inter alia, </span>representing other employees in the Agency's internal grievance procedure. The warden's threat may have constituted a prohibited personnel practice within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). Given the egregious nature of the warden's behavior, further investigation appears warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC did not seek as a remedy consideration of the warden's actions as a prohibited personnel practice. As such, it is not clear what, if any, jurisdictional or other impediments may exist. Accordingly, we issue an order directing that the parties show cause why the Authority should not refer this matter to the Office of Special Counsel, or direct the Respondent to make such a referral, requesting an investigation into whether the warden committed prohibited personnel practices and any action deemed appropriate by the Special Counsel.[18]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;We agree with our dissenting colleague that the Statute does not give us jurisdiction to adjudicate, in the context of a ULP proceeding, whether a prohibited personnel practice has occurred under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). That is why we direct the parties to address the question of <span class="Italic">referring</span> this matter to the Office of Special Counsel, which does have jurisdiction to resolve such issues, rather than making such a determination ourselves.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision reviewing an arbitrator's determination that the agency committed a ULP and a contract violation when its attorney interviewed a unit employee in violation of rules governing formal discussions, no law to supported the union's contention that the arbitrator should have included in his remedial order a provision directing the agency to discipline the agency attorney or to warn the employee of future discipline for repetition of the conduct. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 236 and GSA New England Region,</span> 63 FLRA 651, 652 (2009).</p>
