<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-60"><span class="space">d.</span> Notice of Rule or Policy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Potential for rehabilitation is suggested by cases involving a lack of prior notice of the rules to be followed. <span class="Italic">Tallis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 108, 110-12 (1984), involved a computer specialist fired for misappropriation of computer time and other charges. The AJ, sustaining only the computer time charge, mitigated the penalty to a warning letter. On agency appeal, the Board affirmed the mitigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency makes general contentions which again dispute the presiding official's findings. The agency's contention that appellant as a supervisor was required to set a good example for his subordinates is severely weakened by the fact that higher management had never established any such policy or example even though use of computers for unofficial business was widespread. Furthermore, management had neither warned nor counseled employees that such computer use constituted misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also asserts that removal is appropriate since appellant had notice of the rules and exhibited no potential for rehabilitation. This assertion is directly contradicted by the record. Appellant had never been put on notice by management of any rules violations, nor had he ever been warned or counseled about his conduct. Appellant's first notice that management might be adopting a policy against use of the computer for unofficial business occurred when an investigation began two and a half years before the action was taken and which ultimately served as the basis for the agency's removal of appellant. Upon the suggestion of the investigator, appellant immediately ceased use of the computers for unofficial business. Thus appellant established that he had already modified his behavior in the 2 1/2 years before the action was initiated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends a severe penalty is necessary to impress on the other agency employees that misuse of government computers will not be tolerated. This contention is in variance with the agency's own regulation whose guidelines suggest that the agency should choose the minimum disciplinary action likely to correct the improper behavior. Moreover, the agency's own table of penalties suggests a reprimand to a two-day suspension for a first offense of misuse of government property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency's assertion that there were no mitigating circumstances is also directly contradicted by the record. The presiding official specifically and properly considered the community service nature of the outside projects. Appellant had received no prior disciplinary action in his twenty-five years of service, and his formal performance evaluations were satisfactory. Appellant had also stopped using the computer for unofficial work. Moreover, appellant had received the express permission of his supervisor to use the computer facilities for his community work with the provision that it not interfere with the agency's work. Appellant had never received any notice prior to the investigation that his outside work was considered to be interfering with the agency's work. In addition, his immediate supervisor testified that these projects did not interfere with agency work. Under these circumstances, the reprimand imposed by the presiding official is a reasonable penalty....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another appeal involving mitigation of a penalty for an employee who ceased misconduct upon being warned of the offense is <span class="Italic">Perrotti v. Dept. of Army</span>, 18 MSPR 548, 550 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Perrotti</span>, a supervisory electronics technician was removed because he misused and allowed others to misuse government video equipment. The AJ mitigated the removal to a 15-day suspension. The Board considered mitigation appropriate, noting that there was no evidence of use of the equipment for gain or malice, the employee was not on clear notice that off-duty reproduction of tapes was a violation of agency policy, and, on learning it was, he stopped. The employee had an otherwise fine record and long service. The agency did not show that a penalty less than removal was insufficient to deter similar conduct by the appellant or others. Interestingly, the Board modified the penalty imposed by the AJ: in place of the 15-day suspension, the Board ordered Perrotti demoted to a nonsupervisory position. By permitting others to misuse government property, the appellant created doubt as to his supervisory ability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 35, &#x00B6; 26 (2022) ("Furthermore, in the months preceding the appellant's removal, his supervisor warned him 'numerous times' that his comments and behavior were inappropriate. The record contains evidence that the appellant was verbally counseled at least four times between January and March 2015 regarding his behavior towards his female subordinates."). <span class="Italic">Frickey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 475, 481 (1994), mitigated a removal for a conflict of interest to a suspension. The Board considered that the employee sought advice from the agency and received none, while the agency received advice from its legal office that would have helped the employee to abate the conflict but the agency failed to provide that advice to the employee. <span class="Italic">But see Johnson v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3265) (sustaining demotion for unacceptable workplace conduct: the Board did not err by relying on allegations of prior misconduct and warnings as notice to the appellant that misconduct would not be tolerated; it was immaterial that the allegations did not develop into past discipline); <span class="Italic">cf. Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Mr. Brown's military background and position within a military community should have put him on notice that the affair could cause serious problems within the community.... [E]ven if MWR did not provide an express warning to Mr. Brown regarding the consequences of an adulterous affair with a Marine spouse, his 'common sense should have forewarned him.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prior notice may be of operating instructions or work methods that the employee failed to follow. The agency may show that the appellant knew of the instructions or methods in order to establish a charge that the appellant was negligent at a later date in the performance of her work. <span class="Italic">See Lehnerd v. OPM</span>, 55 <span id="Page_2350"></span>MSPR 170, 173 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf. Franzen v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1997 NP No. 96-3243) (affirming removal for sexual harassment rehabilitation was unlikely since prior training in sexual harassment prevention was not effective); <span class="Italic">Dobert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 148, 153 (1997) (Board was disinclined to mitigate an AWOL removal when the appellant had a poor past record and his rehabilitative potential was minimal because he "had been personally warned about AWOL"). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-132.html#sec8-131">Failure to Follow Instruction</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-129.html#sec8-128">Insubordination and Similar Misconduct</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notice of policies, and agency concerns about future infractions, could be imputed through prior discipline even if those disciplinary actions were settled, <span class="Italic">Tate v. USPS</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 72, 76 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tate makes the separate argument that it was improper for the agency and the administrative judge to consider his past violations of the Postal Service's attendance policy because the disciplinary actions related to those violations had been informally settled. The Board properly found, however, that "whether [Mr. Tate] settled his prior disciplinary actions is irrelevant" because those prior disciplinary actions, although settled, gave Mr. Tate notice that the conduct at issue--tardiness and absence without leave--was in violation of the Postal Service's attendance policy and that possible punishment for future violations included removal. <span class="Italic">See Jinks v. Dep't of Veter-ans Affairs</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 627, 637 (2007). Because the Postal Service may take disciplinary action against an employee if he has notice of his attendance obligations and the likelihood of discipline for continued violations, <span class="Italic">see Williams v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 150, 155 (1995), it was proper for the agency to consider Mr. Tate's prior history of attendance problems for that purpose. The prior incidents were not used as the bases for the charge of failure to maintain a regular work schedule that is the subject of Mr. Tate's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notice of an improper practice need not come from formal training, as in charges involving misuse of a government travel credit card, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-0752-10-0830-I-1 (NP 7/20/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review, as she did below, that she was not properly trained concerning authorized use of her official Government Travel Credit Card (GTCC). The appellant's contentions concerning training appear to be offered in support of her claim that "the agency failed to provide sufficient eviden[ce] that [she] knowingly, maliciously and/or intentionally tried to defraud the federal government."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly determined, there is no law, rule or regulation that requires an agency to provide training. <span class="Italic">See Price v. Department of the Army</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 161, 163 (1982). Furthermore, an agency is not required to prove intent to sustain a charge of unauthorized use of a government credit card. <span class="Italic">See Quarters v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4 (2004). Nonetheless, the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question, is a relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor that the agency considered in this case. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). In rejecting the appellant's claim that the agency's charge could not be sustained, or that the penalty should be mitigated because it did not provide her with proper training concerning the use of her GTCC, however, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant knew or should have known that the card was not for personal use. Our review of the record reveals no error by the administrative judge. In particular, we note that the initial decision contains a detailed credibility determination with regard to these issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier notice of misconduct is not an absolute requirement. If, for example, the agency investigates an employee concerning action that warrants discipline, e.g., timekeeping infractions, the agency is not required to notify the employee of surveillance or of its investigation to sustain the adverse action ultimately imposed. <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 378, 381 (1990); <span class="Italic">see Lopez v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 187, 193 (1982) (removal for patient abuse: the VA required that its disciplinary regulations be brought to employees' attention annually; the appellant did not demonstrate how she was harmed by a lack of annual notice).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An element of knowledge of work practices inherent in performance of a job was equated with notice of workplace rules, or common sense, <span class="Italic">Faden v. VA</span>, NY-0752-11-0331-I-2 (NP 5/1/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant offers no legal or evidentiary support for her claim that the agency's failure to put her on specific notice that this particular behavior would be considered actionable denied her due process. We therefore decline to reach that constitutional question. However, a lack of notice that conduct might be punishable is a basis for finding that a disciplinary action was not taken "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). In arbitration cases, the term "just cause" is used synonymously with the concept of "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." Peter Broida, <span class="Italic">Principles of Federal Sector Arbitration Law</span> 187 (2013) ("Broida"). The most comprehensive and cited statement of what constitutes "just cause" was articulated by Arbitrator Carroll Daugherty in <span class="Italic">The Enterprise Wire Company</span>, 46 LA 359 (1966). Broida at 189. Daugherty set forth seven principles that must be satisfied to establish just cause for discipline. Broida at 192. The first is, "Did the company give the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable disciplinary consequences of the employee's conduct?" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 196. There is a caveat to this principle, namely that "certain offenses such as insubordination, coming to work intoxicated...or theft...are so serious that any employee...may properly be expected to know such conduct is offensive and heavily punishable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[2] Although not formally adopting the first Daugherty principle, we would add a second caveat to its notice requirement, namely that employees may be disciplined without specific notice for behavior that they should know is improper because of professional or similar standards that provide guidance in a particular occupation. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (removal appropriate for a civilian employee who coordinated recreational services for the Marines for engaging in an adulterous affair with the spouse of a Marine who was deployed on active duty; although there had been no "formal notice" that the civilian employee could be subject to removal for such behavior, his common sense should have forewarned him).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Likewise, federal employees may be expected to exercise good judgment, notwithstanding a lack of literal guidance from any agency rule, regulation, or other statement of agency policy. <span class="Italic">Boyer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 56 F.3d 84 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). An agency therefore is not required to specifically prohibit every type of possible misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Brousseau v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1235, 1247 (Ct. Cl. 1981) (while there was no written rule against organizing opposition to the policies of the appellant's superiors, the appellant's common sense should have forewarned him that his actions could lead to discipline); <span class="Italic">accord Mings v. Department of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 389-90 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (no written rule against writing derogatory and inflammatory letters about religious and ethnic groups); <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (no written rule required the use of standardized office worksheets).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that common sense would not have alerted the appellant that some or all of her conduct was inappropriate, if the record were to show that the appellant had no reason to know that the agency would consider certain conduct wrongful, it would not promote the efficiency of the service to punish that conduct in an adverse action.</p>
