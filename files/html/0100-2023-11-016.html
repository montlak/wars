<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-17"><span class="space">3.</span> Employee Revocation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under the Reform Act, dues authorizations may be revoked once a year, not more frequently. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Locals 3342 and 3343</span>, 11 FLRA 600, 602 (1983). In 2020, FLRA provided Guidance, requested by OPM, advising that FLRA would pursue rulemaking with the purpose of ensuring that dues authorizations can be terminated at any time following their first year of <span id="Page_245"></span>effectiveness, <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-107.html">71 FLRA 571</a>, 571-73 (2020) (Member Abbott concurring, Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requests a general statement of policy or guidance on the applicability of the First Amendment principles that the U.S. Supreme Court clarified in <span class="Italic">Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31</span> (<span class="Italic">Janus</span>),[1] to the revocation of federal employees' union-dues assignments under &#x00A7; 7115(a) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). Section 7115(a) states, in pertinent part, that "[i]f an agency has received from an employee in an appropriate unit a written assignment which authorizes the agency to deduct from the pay of the employee amounts for the payment of regular and periodic dues of the exclusive representative of the unit, the agency shall honor the assignment and make an appropriate allotment pursuant to the assignment."[2] The section further provides that, with certain exceptions, "any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of [one] year."[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;138 S. Ct. 2448 (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since its decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army, U.S. Army Materiel Development &#x0026; Readiness Command, Warren, Michigan</span> (<span class="Italic">Army</span>),[4] the Authority has held that the wording in &#x00A7; 7115(a) that "'any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of [one] year' must be interpreted to mean that authorized dues allotments may be revoked only at intervals of [one] year."[5] The Authority has also held that "parties may define through negotiations the procedures for implementing" &#x00A7; 7115, as long as those negotiated procedures preserve employees' rights to have dues deducted from their pay and to revoke their dues assignments at one-year intervals.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;7 FLRA 194 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 199.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 51 FLRA 1427, 1432-37 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request, OPM asks the Authority to issue a general statement of policy or guidance holding that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The constitutional principles clarified in <span class="Italic">Janus</span> have general applicability to agencies and labor organizations in the area of federal employees' requests to revoke union-dues assignments under &#x00A7; 7115(a) of the Statute; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Consistent with <span class="Italic">Janus</span>, upon receiving an employee's request to revoke a previously authorized union-dues assignment, an agency should process the request as soon as administratively feasible, if at least one year has passed since the employee initially authorized union-dues assignment from the employee's pay.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's very first general statement of policy or guidance in Case No. 0-PS-1 concerned the interpretation of &#x00A7; 7115(a), albeit in a different context--specifically, union-dues assignments that were in effect pursuant to Executive Order 11,491,[11] as amended, when the Statute came into force.[12] In other words, the Authority has previously provided guidance on the proper interpretation of &#x00A7; 7115(a) through a general statement. However, when a party later asked the Authority to clarify its general statement from Case No. 0-PS-1, the Authority found that the clarification request did not satisfy the criteria in &#x00A7; 2427.5 of the Authority's Regulations for issuing general statements.[13] We take this opportunity to overrule the Authority's previous decision that resolving questions that further clarify the proper interpretation of &#x00A7; 7115(a) does not warrant issuing a general statement. To the contrary, we find that granting OPM's request for a general statement here is warranted because all parties subject to the Statute must abide by &#x00A7; 7115(a), and, consequently, "resolution of the question presented would have general applicability under the...Statute."[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned, the Authority has held that the wording in &#x00A7; 7115(a) that "'any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of [one] year' <span class="Italic">must</span> be interpreted to mean that authorized dues allotments may be revoked only at intervals of [one] year."[15] We disagree. The most reasonable way to interpret the phrase "any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of [one] year" is that the phrase governs only the first year of an assignment.[16] Except for the limiting conditions in &#x00A7; 7115(b), which &#x00A7; 7115(a) explicitly acknowledges,[17] nothing in the text of &#x00A7; 7115(a) expressly addresses the revocation of dues assignments after the first year.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The dissent argues that we have "point[ed] to no language in &#x00A7; 7115(a)" that establishes that it applies only to the first year. Quite the contrary. The provision says that an "assignment may not be revoked for a period of [one] year," and such wording governs only one year because it refers to only "[one] year." Further, it would be nonsensical to conclude that the one-year period under &#x00A7; 7115(a) is not the first year of an assignment. For example, we could not reasonably find that &#x00A7; 7115(a) prevents the revocation of an assignment during its second year, but not its first year. And because the provision says that it limits revocations for "<span class="Italic">a</span> period of [one] year," it does not limit revocations for multiple periods of one year. Under the dissent's interpretation, one year means "at any time during the first year, and not during subsequent years, except at annual intervals." But the dissent fails to articulate why it ignores the actual wording of the provision in favor of a different restriction on revocations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has stated that the wording in &#x00A7; 7115(a) "must be interpreted" to mean that dues assignments may be revoked only at one-year intervals following the first year,[21] in fact, the Authority made a policy judgment to impose annual revocation periods after the first year of an assignment.[22] In other words, notwithstanding previous assertions otherwise, &#x00A7; 7115(a) neither compels, nor even supports, the existing policy on annual revocation windows.[23] Because it remains our privilege and responsibility to interpret the Statute in a manner that is consistent with an efficient and effective government,[24] we cannot allow our decisions or statements of policy to merely rubber-stamp what was said in the past.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[23] The dissent disagrees, contending that previous Authority decisions relied on legislative history, rather than a policy judgment, to interpret &#x00A7; 7115(a). Dissent at 8-10. The dissent misses the mark because Congress's "authoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history....

A restriction on the ability to revoke dues assignments "for a period of [one] year" is not ambiguous. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a). Thus, interpreting &#x00A7; 7115(a) based on legislative history alone is not only a policy judgment, but also poor statutory construction. <span class="Italic">See Ratzlaf v.

<p class="noindent-1">In our view, it would assure employees the fullest freedom in the exercise of their rights under the Statute if, after the expiration of the initial one-year period during which an assignment may not be revoked under &#x00A7; 7115(a), an employee had the right to initiate the revocation of a previously authorized dues assignment at any time that the employee chooses. Therefore, in the near future, the Authority intends to commence notice-and-comment rulemaking concerning &#x00A7; 7115(a), with the aim of adopting an implementing regulation that hews more closely to the Statute's text. The regulation will be designed to further important policies underlying the Statute, such as robustly protecting employees' rights and freedoms, and guarding unions' institutional interests in a clear and effective procedure for collecting dues. Nevertheless, we recognize that the interests of bargaining-unit employees and unions are not one and the same when employees want to discontinue financial support to unions by stopping dues payments. Thus, the regulation will also seek a reasonable balance between competing interests.</p>

In his dissent to the FLRA's <span id="Page_246"></span>response to the OPM request for guidance, Member DuBester pointed out that "agency fee" arrangements had no connection with the duration or termination provisions of the FSLMRS dues checkoff provision--pertaining to voluntary union membership, not compulsory service fees paid to unions by nonmembers (there are no service fee authorizations in the federal sector). Member DuBester commented, "The majority's decision today constitutes the sort of judicial activism that is squarely inconsistent with the Authority's decision-making responsibilities under our Statute."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7115(a) provides only that authorized dues allotments "may not be revoked for a period of 1 year."...&#8197;Section 7115(a) is silent as to the event from which the 1-year interval is to be measured. Nothing in section 7115(a) or its legislative history supports the Authority's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Interpretation and Guidance</span> that the 1-year interval must be measured from the date an employee authorizes dues withholding. Consequently, we conclude that the date from which the 1-year interval in section 7115(a) is measured is negotiable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Of course, proposals regarding the 1-year interval must be consistent with applicable law and regulations and must allow employees to revoke dues withholding at annual intervals....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 bases the effective date of a revocation on the anniversary of the date when the deduction began.

FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 514 (4th Cir. 2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>), reviewing an arbitration award, summarized some law governing dues authorization revocations and sustained restrictions imposed by a provision of the contract requiring the agency to process a dues revocation form only with the initials or signature by the union chapter president or his or her designee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal employees represented by unions are not required to join a union or pay dues. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. However, agencies are required to honor an employee's voluntary request for the withholding of dues and must transfer the withheld dues to the union without any administrative charges. Dues allotments may be revoked only in one year increments---i.e., once an employee requests that dues be withheld from his or her paycheck, he or she may not revoke such a withholding for one year. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator found that Article 10, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6.A.3 and 6.A.4 of the parties' agreement regarding the revocation of dues withholding were lawful. The Agency contends that, because the provisions require the signature of a Union official on the revocation form, the provisions unreasonably interfere with an employee's right to freely join or refrain from joining a union in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102 and 7115<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7115 of the Statute guarantees employees the right to revoke their dues withholding authorizations at annual intervals.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115. Section 7115 itself provides no particular means for initiating or revoking an employee's dues withholding authorization. The Authority has recognized that "parties may define through negotiations the procedures for implementing [&#x00A7;] 7115" of the Statute, as long as those procedures do not infringe on employees' rights. <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 51 FLRA at 1433 (citing <span class="Italic">Fed. Employees Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, </span>47 FLRA 1289, 1294 (1993)). Accordingly, any procedures negotiated by the parties for the processing of dues revocation requests must conform to the guarantee in &#x00A7; 7115 that employees remain free to revoke their authorizations at annual intervals. <span class="Italic">See </span>51 FLRA at 1433; <span class="Italic">see also United Power Trades Org., </span>62 FLRA 493, 495 (2008)<span class="Italic">. </span>The Authority has held that procedures that interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of this right violate the Statute. <span class="Italic">See </span>51 FLRA at 1433-34</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not addressed the specific requirement at issue here, but has addressed similar requirements. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>, the Authority found that a provision requiring employees to obtain revocation forms from the union office, sign those forms in the union office, and submit the forms to the union office was inherently coercive. <span class="Italic">See Portsmouth</span>, 19 FLRA at 589-91. On the other hand, in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, the Authority held that a provision requiring employees to submit a revocation form directly to the local union did "not <span class="Italic">per se </span>interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right under [&#x00A7;] 7115 of the Statute to revoke their dues withholding authorizations[.]" <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, 51 FLRA at 1437; <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 52 FLRA 52 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe that the facts and circumstances of this case are closer to those of <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, than those of <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>. Like the situation in both <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO </span>and <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>, the dues revocation form must be submitted to the Union. However, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>, an employee can obtain a copy of the dues revocation form from a variety of sources and is not required to obtain the signature of the Union official in person. Further, as in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, the provision itself is not inherently coercive. As the Arbitrator correctly noted, although it is possible that a Union official, when discussing revocation with an employee, may "act in such a way as to create a coercive environment that would violate an employee's statutory right to freely withhold his support from the Union by revoking his dues withholding...[s]uch an occurrence...would simply indicate that a particular Union official might have gone beyond the bounds of Article 10," not that the provisions themselves were unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA then addressed the remedial issue in the <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> case. The arbitrator directed the agency to reimburse the union retroactively for the dues it would have received but for the agency's violation by reinstating retroactively the dues withholding of any employee from whom the agency received a signed statement requesting retroactive reinstatement. The arbitrator declined to adopt the union's remedy that the agency reimburse dues withholding for all employees whose revocation forms were processed without a union official's initials. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> concluded, 64 FLRA 838-40:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the arbitrator finds that a ULP was committed, the Authority defers to the judgment and discretion of the arbitrator in the determination of the remedy. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, </span>48 FLRA 566, 571 (1993). The Authority will not disturb that judgment when there is no basis to conclude that a particular requested remedy is compelled by statute. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Where law requires a particular remedy, however, an arbitrator's failure to award that remedy will be found to be contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See </span>i<span class="Italic">d.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, unless a party establishes that a particular remedy is compelled by statute, we review the remedy determinations of arbitrators in ULP grievance cases just as the Authority's remedies in ULP cases are reviewed by the Federal courts of appeals. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 571-72. More specifically, we uphold the arbitrator's remedy determination unless the determination is "a <span class="Italic">patent attempt </span>to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 572 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)). We have emphasized that this "is a heavy burden indeed." <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator, agreeing with the Union that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy was appropriate, ordered the Agency: (1) to provide the Union with a list of the employees who had revoked their dues withholdings during the relevant time period; and (2) to reinstate retroactively the dues withholding of any employee from whom it received a signed statement requesting retroactive reinstatement and pay those monies to the Union. The Union does not contest the Arbitrator's determination that <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>relief was appropriate. Rather, the Union contests the specifics of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy ordered by the Arbitrator--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the Union contends that the Arbitrator could, and thus should, have awarded different relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union contends that its requested relief was <span class="Italic">permitted </span>by law, the Union cites no law--statutory or otherwise--that <span class="Italic">compelled </span>the relief. Because the Union has failed to establish that its requested remedy was compelled by law, the Union has failed to establish that the Arbitrator committed legal error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C., </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v64/64-067.html">64 FLRA 426</a>, 436 (2010) (union failed to establish that its requested remedy was compelled by statute); <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>48 FLRA at 571 (Authority will not substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator where there is no basis in the record for concluding that a remedy is compelled by the Statute). Moreover, the Union makes no claim that the remedy awarded by the Arbitrator was a "<span class="Italic">patent attempt </span>to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 48 FLRA at 572 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d at 968).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union offers no support for its contention that the Arbitrator erred when he considered the intent of the employees seeking revocation. The cases cited by the Union are consistent with the remedy awarded by the Arbitrator here. In each of the cited cases, the remedy <span id="Page_247"></span>awarded was an attempt to make the union whole--which is precisely what the Arbitrator did here. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 22 ("A return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>...means a return to the point at which the improper action occurred."). This argument, thus, is nothing more than a reiteration of the Union's argument above--that, because, in its view, the Arbitrator could have awarded different relief, he should have. As noted, however, this is not a sufficient basis to overturn the Arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Union's contention that the award does not preserve employees' statutory and regulatory rights to seek a waiver of their obligation to pay dues retroactively. In this regard, the award preserves employees' rights not to pay retroactive dues. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 22 (providing for the Union to supply the Agency with a "signed statement from each employee <span class="Italic">who wishes to reinstate, retroactively, his dues withholding</span>" (emphasis added)). Thus, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is deficient on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review the Fourth Circuit affirmed FLRA's decision sustaining a requirement for a union signoff on a dues revocation form and the associated remedy when the agency did not require that procedure to be followed, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 514, 515-20 (4th Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the exclusive representative for IRS employees, NTEU negotiated a collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") with the IRS that governed, among other issues, procedures for handling dues withholding and revocations. After the CBA expired without a successor agreement in place in June 2006, the IRS notified NTEU that it would no longer honor what it deemed to be permissive provisions of the CBA that it considered to be a violation of law or regulations, including Article 10, Sections 6.A.3 and 6.A.4, which governed revocation of dues withholding. Pursuant to Article 10, an employee's dues revocation could</p>
<p class="noindent-2">only be effected by submission of a completed [revocation form] that has been initialed by the chapter president or his or her designee. If the [form] is not initialed, the Employer shall return the [form] to the employee and direct the employee to the proper Union official for initialing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In effect for nearly 12 years, the union sign-off served two goals: (1) to provide the Union with an opportunity to learn why an employee wished to revoke membership and attempt to change her mind and (2) to facilitate budgeting for the upcoming fiscal year. On July 13, 2006, the IRS informed NTEU that the Agency would begin processing revocation forms even if such forms did not have a union sign-off; the Agency then notified employees of the change. Subsequently, during the annual two-week period for submission of revocation forms, the Agency processed approximately 1,000 forms without a union sign-off.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 14, 2006, the Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency's decision to process the forms constituted a violation of Article 10 of the CBA, an unfair labor practice ("ULP") under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (2), and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101-7135 ("Statute"), and a violation of past practice. Following a hearing on November 22, 2006, the arbitrator issued an opinion and award on February 23, 2007, sustaining in part the Union's grievance. The arbitrator found that Article 10 was a lawful and mandatory provision that continued to be effective past the expiration of the CBA; thus, the Agency's decision to process revocation forms without a union sign-off violated Article 10 and constituted a ULP under the Statute. In finding that the Agency's actions violated the Statute, however, the arbitrator refused to find that the Agency's actions illegally interfered with or coerced employees in the exercise of their statutory rights. Because at least some employees might have changed their minds about their revocations had the IRS honored the union sign-off procedures, the arbitrator found that the Agency violated the Union's right to receive some dues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a remedy, the arbitrator ordered the Agency to follow the revocation procedures set out in Article 10 of the CBA, to post a notice admitting its statutory violations, and to pay 75% of the arbitration fees and expenses. While agreeing with the Union that a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> was the appropriate remedy, the arbitrator rejected the Union's demand for reinstatement of dues withholding and reimbursement to the Union for all employees whose revocation forms were processed without a union sign-off. The arbitrator found it "highly speculative to assume that all, or most, employees whose revocation forms were improperly processed would have withdrawn their revocations had Article 10 procedures been faithfully followed." Instead, the arbitrator ordered the IRS to provide the Union with a list of employees who had revoked membership without the requisite union sign-off, stating that the Union could contact those employees about voluntarily reinstating their dues withholding. The arbitrator directed the IRS to process any reinstatement authorizations submitted as a result of the Union's contact with those employees, retroactively withhold dues from those employees, and pay those dues to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties filed timely exceptions to the arbitrator's award with the FLRA. The Agency argued that its decision not to honor the Article 10 revocation procedures was not contrary to law and that the arbitrator erred in finding its actions violated the CBA and constituted a ULP. NTEU excepted to the arbitrator's remedy, arguing that the decision not to reimburse the Union for dues of all employees whose revocation forms were improperly processed was contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 28, 2010, FLRA issued a final decision and order rejecting both parties' exceptions. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and United States Dep't of Treasury Internal Revenue Service,</span> 64 F.L.R.A. 833 (2010). With respect to the IRS's exceptions, FLRA held that the negotiated union sign-off procedures were valid and that, in improperly processing revocation forms, the Agency violated the contract and committed a ULP. With respect to NTEU's exceptions, FLRA found that the Union had failed to provide support showing that full reimbursement was compelled by law. FLRA reviewed the arbitrator's decision pursuant to a deferential standard that directs affirmance of a remedy unless it is a "patent attempt to achieve means other than those that can properly be said to effectuate the policies of the Statute." 64 F.L.R.A. at 839. It found the remedy ordered by the arbitrator passed muster and confirmed the award.</p>

FLRA,</span> 910 F.2d 964, 967, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 464 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of Commerce, Bureau of Census v. FLRA,</span> 976 F.2d 882, 885 (4th Cir. 1992). Thus, we will uphold the Authority's remedial order "'unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 910 F.2d at 968 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Authority upheld the arbitrator's remedy, finding that "[b]ecause the Union has failed to establish that its requested remedy was compelled by law, the Union has failed to establish that the Arbitrator committed legal error." 64 F.L.R.A. at 839. The FLRA found that the Union had failed to provide support for its contention that the arbitrator erred by considering the intent of the employees who improperly revoked their authorization for dues withholding. In rejecting the Union's requested remedy, the arbitrator reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The fact that the Agency may have deprived the Union of a contractual opportunity to persuade employees--some of whom might have been receptive to the Union's efforts--to withdraw their revocations is not a lawful reason to deprive those employees who would have stuck with their original decision of their statutory right to freely withdraw their support from the Union.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[2]&#x2003;The arbitrator made passing reference to potential sovereign immunity concerns raised by the Union's requested remedy, but such concerns do not obtain here. The Agency had argued that sovereign immunity barred the remedy requested by the Union, <span class="Italic">citing Department of Army v. FLRA,</span> 56 F.3d 273, 312 U.S. App. D.C. 309 (D.C. Cir. 1995). At oral argument before us, counsel for the FLRA argued that sovereign immunity was not a bar to the remedy requested in this case because the CBA between the IRS and the Union created a mechanism by which any dues the Agency failed to remit would be deducted from the employees' pay and would not impose upon the government fisc.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">While we are somewhat skeptical of the correctness of the FLRA's reasoning in this regard, we need not address it here, as we conclude that the Union's requested remedy is of an equitable nature and thus falls outside the scope of the D.C. Circuit's analysis in <span class="Italic">Department of Army</span>. In that case, the court determined that the remedy requested by the union constituted money damages for which the agency had not waived sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 276. The union there was seeking compensatory damages on behalf of its members for consequential losses (bank overdraft fees and interest) incurred by its members as a result of the agency's delayed payment of salaries to members/employees. In effect, the union's complaint could be characterized as a "class-action" of sorts, with the union attempting to assert damages claims <span id="Page_248"></span>against the government on behalf of a class consisting of its members; theoretically, each union member could have filed suit against the government for her loss.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">The remedy requested by NTEU here is dramatically unlike that struck down in <span class="Italic">Department of Army</span>. Here, the Union seeks reimbursement for dues payments it claims are owed to it by its members as a result of the IRS's actions. In no way can such a remedy be considered "a substitute for a consequential loss," but is rather "'the very thing'" to which the Union claims it is entitled. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (distinguishing between legal and equitable monetary awards). While the IRS did not take away money from the Union which it owed the Union, it impeded the Union's receipt of dues payments owed to the Union by members who were permitted to resign from the Union too easily. In short, the Union seeks to be restored to the position it would have occupied but for the IRS's wrongdoing. Thus, its requested remedy is a form of restitution, albeit in the form of a monetary award, as to which the government has waived sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator nonetheless found that <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief required a "return to the point at which the improper action occurred" and ordered the Agency to permit the Union to contact the employees whose revocation forms were improperly processed, the very opportunity that had been lost as a result of the Agency's actions. We discern no reason to disturb the remedy upheld by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7102 of the Statute gives employees the right to refrain from union participation "freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. Section 7115 of the Statute allows employees to establish and to revoke dues withholding from their pay, subject only to the condition that the employee's assignment "may not be revoked for a period of 1 year." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a). While the union and an agency may bargain for the specific procedures for implementing &#x00A7; 7115, the negotiated procedures may not infringe on the employees' right to "remain free to revoke their dues authorizations at annual intervals." <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO and Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 51 F.L.R.A. 1427, 1433 (1996) (finding negotiated procedures at issue did not "interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in their exercise of rights" to freely revoke). <span class="Italic">See also Felter v. Southern Pacific Co. et al.,</span> 359 U.S. 326, 79 S. Ct. 847, 3 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1959) (concluding that revocation procedures in agreement with private sector employer unlawfully infringed on right of employees to revoke authorization after one year). While not all provisions specifying the manner in which an employee can revoke are unlawful restrictions, such provisions must not unduly burden the employee or effectively preclude her from exercising her right to revoke dues withholding authorization after one year. <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO and Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 51 F.L.R.A. at 1435-37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority of the cases cited by the Union before the Authority and in its brief to this court do not implicate the right of an employee to revoke her dues withholding authorization; instead, they turn on the failure of the employer to process dues assignments properly submitted by employees. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Treasury, U.S. Mint and AFGE, Mint Council,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. 1095, 1098 (1990); <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Systems Ctr. and Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees,</span> 16 F.L.R.A. 1124, 1126 (1984); <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency and AFGE,</span> 5 F.L.R.A. 126 (1981); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy and NTEU,</span> 1998 FLRA LEXIS 228, at *7-8 (FLRA ALJ Dec.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union cites to only one case in which revocation was at issue. <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Lakeside Med. Ctr. and Serv. Employees Int'l Union,</span> 12 F.L.R.A. 244, 247-48 (1983). In that case, the agency wrongfully processed dues revocations outside the annual period set out in the CBA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority's decision there, however, relied on the fact that the agency's decision to honor the revocations ran afoul of the only statutory condition imposed on revocation procedures: that an employee's dues withholding authorization could not be revoked for a period of one year. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 246 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a)). In fashioning a remedy, the Authority ordered the agency to reinstate dues withholding for each employee whose revocation was untimely under the CBA and "whose assignment has not reached a date appropriate for termination pursuant to section 7115(a) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 247-48 (emphasis added). The Authority also ordered the agency to reimburse the union for dues "it would have received from the pay of bargaining unit employees but for the Respondent's effectuation of untimely submitted dues revocations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, neither the Union nor the Agency argues that any of the revocation forms, despite being improperly filed, violated the one-year statutory bar on revocation. Thus, the circumstances presented in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span> are clearly distinguishable from the circumstances presented in this case, where the revocations processed by the Agency violated the CBA, but not the statutory condition on revocation. Consequently, the Authority did not act arbitrarily in sustaining a remedial order that differed somewhat from that at issue in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union fails to persuade us that it has a right to demand dues from the Agency for employees who voluntarily submitted revocation forms consistent with their statutory rights.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. Felter,</span> 359 U.S. at 333-35 (stating that parties may not "treat as nullities revocation notices which are clearly intended as such and about whose authenticity there is no dispute"). It is doubtful, at best, that all employees who voluntarily chose to submit timely revocations would have changed their minds if subject to the union sign-off procedure.[3] The arbitrator found that such an assumption by the Union "is purely speculative," and, consequently, his ordered remedy, which provided the Union with the opportunity to contact employees whose withholding was improperly revoked, was appropriate so as not to "deprive those employees who would have stuck with their original decision of their statutory right to freely withdraw their support from the Union."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We candidly acknowledge that affording the Union an opportunity to persuade a former union member to rescind a dues revocation form that has already been processed by the Agency is not exactly the same opportunity afforded the Union by the collective bargaining agreement: an opportunity to dissuade a union member from submitting a dues revocation form before it is submitted to the Agency. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the marginally-increased burden thus imposed on the Union does not undermine the efficacy of the remedial order sustained by the Authority in this case, or otherwise support the conclusion that the Authority abused its discretion in doing so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Authority's decision upholding the arbitrator's award was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we have no warrant to disturb the Authority's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs,</span> 62 FLRA 493, 493, 495-96 (2009), explained how a contract provision regarding cessation of dues withholding was considered, in the context of an arbitration case, contrary to the statutory scheme governing withdrawal by an employee of consent for dues withholding after one year:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 26.4 of the CBA provides that employees who want to terminate the withholding of union dues from their paychecks may do so after they have participated in union dues withholdings for one year. Article 26.4 also provides that the dues withholdings will not be terminated until the first pay period after January 1, regardless of when the employee submits a request to terminate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In March 2000, a unit employee authorized dues withholding, which was processed and implemented by the Agency two months later. In May 2005, the same employee requested that dues withholding be terminated. The Agency processed the termination request in August 2005, and terminated dues withholding the following month. The Union filed a grievance, claiming that Article 26.4 required the Agency to wait until January 2006 to terminate dues withholding in that instance. When the grievance was not resolved, it was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first issue, the Arbitrator found that the parties' CBA did not preclude the Agency from giving effect to the employee's May 2005 request to terminate dues withholding in August 2005 because Article 26.4 of the contract is "flawed." In particular, the Arbitrator determined that Article 26.4 conflicts with Authority precedent prohibiting dues withholding provisions from requiring employees to pay union dues for more than one year. With regard to the second issue, the Arbitrator ordered the parties to engage in collective bargaining to correct the flaw in Article 26.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has interpreted &#x00A7; 7115(a) of the Statute as permitting employees to revoke union dues allotment at yearly intervals. <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Lakeside Med. Ctr., Chicago, Ill., </span>12 FLRA 244, 246 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Army, U.S. Army Materiel Dev. and Readiness Command, Warren, Mich., </span>7 FLRA 194, 198-9 (1981)).[2] In this connection, the Authority has held that under &#x00A7; 7115(a), an employee can be precluded from revoking an authorization for dues allotment for a period of one year, but cannot be precluded from revoking the authorization for a period of greater than one year. <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU, AFL-CIO,</span> 40 FLRA 657, 688 (1991) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1931,</span> 32 FLRA 1023, 1029 (1988) (dues allotment provision inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7115(a) because it precluded employees from revoking dues authorizations for almost two years)). Parties may define the intervals for dues revocation through negotiations as long as those intervals are consistent with &#x00A7; 7115(a). <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 40 FLRA at 688-9; <span class="Italic">see AFGE, AFL-CIO, Dep't of Educ.

<p class="noindent-3"><span id="Page_249"></span>(a)&#x2003;If an agency has received from an employee in an appropriate unit a written assignment which authorizes the agency to deduct from the pay of the employee amounts for the payment of regular and periodic dues of the exclusive representative of the unit, the agency shall honor the assignment and make an appropriate allotment pursuant to the assignment....

<p class="noindent-2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the award is contrary to &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7115 and 7116 of the Statute because the Arbitrator failed to find that the Agency committed an unfair labor practice by terminating the affected employee's dues withholdings at a time that conformed to neither the requirements of the CBA nor the employee's anniversary date of joining the Union. However, here, as in <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 40 FLRA at 688,<span class="Italic"> </span>the Arbitrator found that the dues allotment provision in the CBA prevented bargaining unit members from revoking their dues allotments for a period beyond one year. The Union does not dispute this interpretation of Article 26.4. Thus, consistent with <span class="Italic">NAGE, </span>Article 26.4 is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7115(a) of the Statute. Because Article 26.4 is contrary to law, the Arbitrator did not err by finding that the Agency properly terminated the affected employee's dues allotments at a time that was inconsistent with Article 26.4. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Office of the Adjutant Gen., Ga., DoD, Atlanta, Ga., </span>54 FLRA 654, 666 (1998) (respondent's refusal to honor portion of agreement upheld because agreement was inconsistent with sections of DoD Appropriations Act).</p>
<p class="noindent">The negotiated dues revocation procedure must be reasonable. It is inherently coercive for the parties to require an employee seeking to withdraw authorization to do so on a form that can only be obtained at the union hall and that must be executed there and submitted directly to the union. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Cochrane</span>, 19 FLRA 586 (1985). The parties can agree through their labor contract that the union will receive and process the revocation forms. It is not inherently coercive that the parties adopt a practice that the union provide the forms to employees. Delay by the union in processing the forms, once received, constitutes a ULP. <span class="Italic">AFGE and Partlow</span>, 51 FLRA 1427, 1429-30, 1432-39 (1996), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, defined how the union may be given principal responsibility for initial distribution and processing of dues revocation forms:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Two employees (Bonnie Greelman and Dennis Partlow) at the Activity's facility in Redding, California joined the Local on or about April 16, 1992. Both employees decided in early 1993 to revoke their memberships and, starting in January and February, made several requests to Local officials for dues revocation forms. Partlow also contacted the Activity's personnel office, as well as the Local, about revoking his membership, but never received an SF 1188. After making several requests to Local representatives, Greelman received an SF 1188 in April. She completed the form on April 22, 1993, and sent it to the Activity's payroll office. The Activity, however, refused to process her form because it had not been dated and signed by a Local official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity's Chief of Human Resources testified to the effect that the Activity had a longstanding practice of not providing SF 1188's to employees who wanted to revoke their dues withholding authorizations, leaving it to the Local to maintain a supply of the forms and furnish them to employees. The applicable negotiated procedures for revoking an employee's dues withholding authorization are set out in the August 13, 1982, collective bargaining agreement between the Agency and the Union. This agreement covers a nationwide exclusive unit and provides at Article 31, section 6 that, among other things, employees must submit their SF 1188's to the Local for processing.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The full text of Article 31, section 6 is as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A. Employees may revoke their dues withholding only once a year, on the anniversary date of their original allotment, by submitting a timely SF 1188 to the union representatives designated for such purpose. The union representative must certify by date and signature the date the 1188 is given to the union representative or by some other appropriate date stamping device. In order for the SF 1188 to be timely, it must be submitted to the Union between the anniversary date of the effective date of the dues withholding and 30 calendar days prior to the anniversary date.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;The union official will, by reference to the remittance listing, determine the anniversary date of the allotment. The ending date of the pay period in which the anniversary date occurs will be entered in Item (6) on the SF 1188. The entry will be initiated by the union official, who will then deliver the form to the Fiscal Officer prior to the close of business of the Friday following the date entered in Item (6). If, through error of the Union, a form 1188 is received in the Fiscal office later than the agreed to date, the Fiscal office will process the form at the earliest possible time, but no later than the first pay period following receipt. Union representatives may be in a duty status while receiving and processing the SF 1188, and will be released from normal duties to carry out these duties under local release procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7115 of the Statute ("Allotments to representatives") authorizes employees both to establish and to revoke dues withholding allotments from their pay.[4] As relevant here, the only condition that section 7115 imposes on the revocation of an employee's dues withholding authorization is contained in the last sentence of section 7115(a). That sentence provides that an employee's assignment "may not be revoked for a period of 1 year." [5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Section 7115 provides, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;If an agency has received from an employee in an appropriate unit a written assignment which authorizes the agency to deduct from the pay of the employee amounts for the payment of regular and periodic dues of the exclusive representative of the unit, the agency shall honor the assignment and make an appropriate allotment pursuant to the assignment....&#8197;Except as provided under subsection (b) of this section, any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of 1 year.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 7115 itself prescribes no particular means for initiating or revoking an employee's dues withholding authorization. However, regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) require that the establishment or revocation of any form of employee pay allotment, including an allotment for labor organization dues, be made in writing. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.312(c) (1995). SF 1188's were developed by OPM for use in revoking dues withholding authorizations, although their use was never mandatory and agencies were permitted to develop their own forms if they chose to do so. Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 990-2, Subchapter S3-8(3) (1982) (discontinued 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Based on the legislative history of the Statute, and on provisions of its predecessor, Executive Order 11491, as amended, the Authority has construed the phrase "may not be revoked for a period of 1 year" to mean that dues withholding authorizations "may be revoked only at intervals of 1 year." <span class="Italic">U.S. Army, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness</span> <span class="Italic">Command, Warren, Michigan</span>, 7 FLRA 194, 199 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that "parties may define through negotiations the procedures for implementing section 7115" of the Statute, so long as those procedures do not infringe on employees' rights. <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO, Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 47 FLRA 1289, 1294 (1993). To ensure that employee rights are not infringed, any procedures negotiated by the parties for the processing of dues revocation requests must conform with the guarantee in section 7115 that employees remain free to revoke their dues authorizations at annual intervals. To the extent that negotiated procedures interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of this right, those procedures will be found to violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found such a violation in negotiated procedures requiring that "revocation of dues withholding authorizations were to be executed on forms which could only be obtained from the Union at the Union hall, and which had to be executed and submitted directly to the Union there." <span class="Italic">Department of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth</span>, <span class="Italic">New Hampshire</span>, 19 FLRA 586, 589 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>). The Authority found these provisions "inherently coercive of the employees' right to refrain from joining or assisting a labor organization as set forth in section 7102 of the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (citations omitted).[6] However, it expressly declined in <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span> to pass upon whether "dues revocation forms provided by an exclusive representative are <span class="Italic">per se</span> unlawful," holding only that "the Union's control of the forms in the circumstances of this case was unlawfully coercive<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 590, n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The relevant portion of the contract in <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span> provided only that "[u]nit employees shall obtain a copy of the Dues Revocation form (SF-1188) from the Council office during nonwork hours." 19 FLRA at 595, n.1. The form that employees signed to authorize their dues withholding allotments, however, provided that SF 1188's "may only be obtained and filled out in the offices of the employee organization." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority relied on two private sector decisions in finding the provisions before it in <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span> unlawful. In the first of these decisions, <span class="Italic">Felter v. Southern Pacific Co</span>. <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, 359 U.S. 326 (1959) (<span class="Italic">Felter</span>), the Supreme Court held that the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 151-163 (1988), did not authorize a contract provision requiring that employees could revoke their dues withholding authorizations only by completing a form furnished by the union. The Court concluded that Congress had deliberately chosen to deny unions and employers the power to bargain for any restrictions on the freedom of employees to revoke their dues withholding authorizations by notifying the employer in writing after one year. In the second decision cited by the Authority, <span class="Italic">Newport</span> <span class="Italic">News <span id="Page_250"></span>Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company</span>, 253 NLRB 721, <span class="Italic">enforced</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom. Peninsula Shipbuilders Association v. NLRB</span>, 663 F.2d 488 (4th Cir. 1981), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a similar contract provision violated the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 141-187 (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993). It determined, however, only that the provision was unlawful as applied and did not reach the question of whether, under <span class="Italic">Felter</span>, the provision was also unlawful <span class="Italic">per se</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is clear that employers and unions in the private sector cannot infringe on the basic right of employees to revoke their dues withholding authorizations, neither the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) nor the courts have held <span class="Italic">every</span> contract provision that bears in some manner on dues revocation to be unlawful.[7] For example, in <span class="Italic">Boston Gas</span> <span class="Italic">Company</span>, 130 NLRB 1230 (1961), the NLRB found that <span class="Italic">Felter</span> did not apply to a contract provision requiring employees to give notice to the union and the employer as a precondition to revoking their dues withholding authorizations. The NLRB reasoned that the notification provision at issue did "not constitute...an impediment to an employee's freedom of revocation[,]" that it was "not unduly burdensome upon employees, and that employees [were] not thereby 'effectively' precluded from revoking their dues assignments." 130 NLRB at 1231. Although the issue in <span class="Italic">Boston Gas</span> was whether a contract containing such a provision was valid as a bar to an election, the NLRB has since held that similar provisions are themselves enforceable. <span class="Italic">E.g., Rock-Tenn Company</span>, 238 NLRB 403 (1978) (employer violated Labor Management Relations Act by honoring dues revocations from employees who had not notified the union.) <span class="Italic">See also American Commercial Lines</span>, 296 NLRB 622 (1989). The Fifth and Fourth Circuits have agreed with the NLRB that notification provisions are not in and of themselves unlawful. <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;As the Supreme Court pointed out in <span class="Italic">Felter</span>, administrative arrangements between the parties for the processing of dues revocation requests are not themselves improper:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Of course, the parties may act to minimize the procedural problems caused by Congress' choice [of language controlling dues revocations]. [Employers] and labor organizations may set up procedures through the collective agreement for processing, between themselves, individual assignments and revocations received, and [employers] may make reasonable designations, in or out of collective bargaining contracts, of agents to whom revocations may be sent. Revocations, after all, must be sent somewhere.</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span class="Italic">Felter</span>, 359 U.S. at 334-5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 31, section 6 imposes only one requirement on an employee seeking to revoke a dues withholding authorization: the employee must submit "a timely SF 1188 to the union representatives designated for such purpose." As previously noted, the General Counsel acknowledges that Article 31, section 6 does not require employees to obtain SF 1188's from any particular source. Contrary to the Union's assertion in its exceptions, the Judge found no such requirement in the agreement. Instead, he found only that the Local and the Activity had established a practice under which the Local alone maintained copies of SF 1188's and the Activity referred employees seeking to revoke their dues withholding authorizations to the Local. As a result, we must decide whether the requirement that an employee submit his or her SF 1188 directly to the Local violates the Statute. Specifically, we must decide whether this requirement <span class="Italic">per se</span> interferes with, restrains or coerces employees in the exercise of their right under section 7115 to revoke their dues withholding authorizations at annual intervals.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Requiring an employee to submit an SF 1188 to the Local in order to revoke his or her dues withholding authorization may indeed, as the Judge found, offer a "possibility for anxiety and tension." However, the "possibility" that a contract provision interferes with employee rights does not lead to the conclusion that the provision <span class="Italic">per se</span> interferes with those rights. Therefore, we cannot conclude from this possibility alone that Article 31, section 6 <span class="Italic">per se</span> interferes with employee rights under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge determined that the Activity and the Local, "simply by their inaction," failed to process the Charging Parties' "timely requests" to revoke their dues withholding authorizations, and thereby violated the Statute. The Activity does not except to this finding. We therefore uphold the allegations in the complaint that the Activity violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by interfering with employee rights under section 7102 and section 7115.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union bases its exception solely on its disagreement with the Judge's characterization of the Charging Parties' requests as "timely." The Union asserts that Partlow attempted to revoke his dues withholding authorization "well outside of his anniversary date and [30 day] window period." As to Greelman, the Union asserts only that "the record establishes serious doubt" that her SF 1188 was ever received. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the Charging Parties were untimely in seeking to revoke their dues withholding authorizations misapprehends the nature of the violation in these cases. The Union does not dispute the Judge's findings that, between January and April, 1993, both Charging Parties repeatedly expressed to the Local their desire to revoke their memberships and made several unsuccessful requests to the Local for SF 1188's. These findings are clearly supported by the record evidence and these findings lead us to conclude that the Local violated the Statute. The timeliness of the Charging Parties' requests for SF 1188's is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, therefore, that the Local's conduct violated section 7116(b)(1) and (8) of the Statute by interfering with, restraining or coercing the Charging Parties in the exercise of the right guaranteed by section 7115 of the Statute to revoke their dues withholding authorizations after one year. We also conclude that, by interfering with the Charging Parties' right to revoke their dues withholding authorizations, the Local interfered with, restrained or coerced the Charging Parties in the exercise of their right under section 7102 to refrain from joining or assisting a labor organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel similarly offers no theory, and none is otherwise apparent, in support of the allegation that the Agency violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. We will accordingly dismiss that allegation. As to the Activity, which is also alleged to have violated section 7116(a)(3), the Judge found only that it violated the Statute by its "inaction" in response to Charging Party Partlow's inquiry about revoking his membership in the Local. Unlike Greelman, Partlow never submitted an SF 1188 to the Activity. Although the Activity did not act on Greelman's SF 1188 but, instead, forwarded it to the Local for processing, the evidence shows that it did so in accordance with the provisions of Article 31, section 6, which we have determined not to interfere <span class="Italic">per se</span> with section 7115 of the Statute. Thus, because the Activity did not fail or refuse to process a valid dues withholding revocation from either Charging Party in these cases, it is unnecessary to decide whether it would have violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute had it done so.</p>
