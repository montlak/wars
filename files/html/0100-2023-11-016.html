<h3 class="h3" id="sec4-17"><span class="space">C.</span> HEARSAY</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Hearsay is so often defined by what it is not that one forgets what it is. Avoiding a few complexities, hearsay is a statement made out of court or the hearing room, offered during the hearing process to the adjudicator to prove the fact asserted in the statement. In its most frequent context, hearsay consists of hearing witness A stating what another person, B, said at some point prior to the hearing. The statement of B, narrated by A, is offered for the truth of what B said. The hearsay statement may be verbal or written, sworn or unsworn; it is hearsay nonetheless. In the usual case of hearsay, there is no opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the hearsay statement. That is why the evidence is ordinarily precluded or restricted in judicial proceedings. Hearsay is suspect because it denies the party against whom it is offered the ability to confront the real declarant. Cross-examination, with the ability to confront one's accusers, is the "greatest engine for truth." <span class="Italic">California v. Green</span>, 399 U.S. 149, 158 (1970).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bennett v. USDA</span>, DE-1221-15-0461-W-1 (NP 11/21/2022), provides an example of what is not hearsay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also objects to the testimony of the Base Manager and an Employee Relations Specialist, who both confirmed that they discussed over the telephone the possibility of rescinding the appellant's smoke jumping duties before he made his disclosures, given the testimony's supposed hearsay nature. We disagree with the appellant that this testimony constituted hearsay evidence. Pursuant to the Federal Rule of Evidence, 801(c), hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at a trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1997); Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). Here, both witnesses, who testified under oath, had firsthand knowledge of these telephone conversations because they participated in them and related what they recalled about those conversations. Further, the record does not indicate that the statements offered into evidence were made by anybody other than the declarants. As such, we consider these statements to be direct testimony and believe that the administrative judge gave them the appropriate evidentiary weight. Accordingly, the appellant's argument regarding hearsay is without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Hearsay is admissible and probative in Board litigation, <span class="Italic">DiLorenzo v. VA</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 57 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"It has long been settled, however, that hearsay evidence may be used in Board proceedings and may be accepted as preponderant evidence even without corroboration if, to a reasonable mind, the circumstances are such as to lend it credence. In addition, we have held that procedural matters such as the admissibility of evidence, including hearsay, fall within the sound discretion of the Board and its AJs." <span class="Italic">Kewley</span>, 153 F.3d at 1364.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pak v. VA</span>, 840 Fed. Appx. 533 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("The MSPB may rely on hearsay as 'substantial evidence in an administrative proceeding...if the hearsay is inherently truthful and more credible than the evidence offered against it.' <span class="Italic">Sanders v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 801 F.2d 1328, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1986)."); <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, CH-844E-16-0273-I-1, n.5 (NP 6/13/2022) ("Although the Board uses the Federal Rules of Evidence as nonbinding guidance, <span class="Italic">Holton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 13 n.4 (2016), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 884 F.3d 1142 (Fed.

App'x 305 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The determination of whether hearsay evidence is sufficient to prove the truth of a contention depends upon the evidence's reliability and trustworthiness, which is evaluated pursuant to the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 87 (1981). <span class="Italic">Vaughn</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 9."); <span class="Italic">Fairfield v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant is correct that the fact that much of the agency's case against him is based on hearsay evidence, which is generally entitled to less weight than live testimony, we find that the administrative judge properly afforded the hearsay evidence significant weight under the circumstances of this case. The appellant argues that the hearsay evidence is not reliable because the declarants were biased against him and because their statements were fully contradicted by his own testimony. There was some evidence that the declarants were concerned that the appellant could retaliate against them should he ever become a manager. The concerns of the declarants that there might be a penalty exacted for their coming forward does not necessarily detract from their statements. Further, the fact that the appellant's testimony contradicted the hearsay evidence does not detract significantly from its reliability because the administrative judge found that the appellant's testimony was not credible and her credibility findings are owed deference. Therefore, although the agency's case relied fairly heavily on hearsay evidence, we find that the hearsay nature of the agency's evidence did not have a significant impact on the reliability of that evidence or on the strength of the agency's case against the appellant.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">To test the sufficiency of hearsay evidence, one may use objections as the evidence is offered or, according to <span class="Italic">Calhoun</span>, 626 F.2d at 150, one may use a motion to strike at the close of the case of the party offering the hearsay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that a motion to strike is an entirely appropriate means of raising the question of whether hearsay, although admissible <span class="Italic">ab initio</span>, should nonetheless be stricken because it will form the basis of the decision and is insufficiently reliable for that purpose. Since some of the factors relevant to determining the reliability of hearsay include whether or not it is contradicted or corroborated, as well as whether witnesses are credible, objection need not be made at the time the hearsay evidence is proffered. A motion to strike made at the close of evidence allows the hearing examiner to consider the entire record....&#8197;Additionally, a motion to strike at the close of the evidence provides the Administrative Law Judge with a full opportunity to evaluate the centrality of the hearsay to the disposition of the matter. Clearly, the more central the hearsay is to the agency's case, the more serious the question of basic fairness and the more critical the questions of reliability may become.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although not a ruling on hearsay, <span class="Italic">Rabourn v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution states that:</p>
