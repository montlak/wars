<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-161"><span class="space">c.</span> Ambiguous Term; Failure to Waive Future Appeal Right</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">At times it is unclear whether the agency is removing an employee for violation of an LCA, or whether the agreement is mentioned only as part of the history of an adverse action that stands on its own. The LCA must be examined to determine if it waives all appeal rights or whether appeal rights are preserved and, if so, under what circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most LCAs waive all appeal rights--the idea being that the agreement forecloses further litigation if the LCA (often a product of litigation) is violated. The LCA, amounting to a contract of settlement between the parties, must be evaluated by the AJ to determine its effect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 95 MSPR 547, 550-51 &#x00B6; 11 (2004) (Board gently chided the parties for failing to place the removal decision into the record so that the Board could determine the basis of the removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The waiver of a future appeal must be explicitly stated in the agreement. If the agreement recites only that it constitutes a "last chance opportunity," with a violation to result in removal, there is no waiver of a future appeal. A waiver cannot be established by implication without evidence showing that the words "last chance" were defined by agency regulation or the parties to mean a waiver of future appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Riese v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 364, 366-68 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the instant case is distinguishable from the cases which have enforced an agreement in which an appellant waives his right to appeal a disciplinary action to the Board. In <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 668 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court cited with approval the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Ferby,</span> 26 MSPR at 455, that the right to appeal to the Board "was susceptible to waiver if the action was the informed, intentional abandonment of a known right, free of any coercion or duress." In addition, the court noted that the Board required that "the terms of the waiver appear comprehensive, freely made, and fair." <span class="Italic">McCall, id.; Ferby</span> at 456. The court also held that "[i]f an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary and capricious action, as a breaching party it would not be able to enforce the agreement." <span class="Italic">McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">McCall</span> and the Board in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> enforced Postal Service last chance settlement agreements because they met all of the above criteria. In both cases, the last chance settlement agreements provided for an explicit waiver of appeal rights to the Board during a one-year probationary period, and each agreement contained an almost identical provision showing that the appellant clearly understood what the waiver provision meant.[1] <span class="Italic">See McCall</span> at 665; <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> at 454-55.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;This provision in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> was as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I clearly understand the last chance opportunity agreement as stated in items 1 through 5, and fully agree with the terms of the settlement. I know and understand that I have appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board with respect to appealing my removal to that agency. With this agreement signed 13 May 82, I waive all appeal rights regarding my removal that was effective April 20, 1982, to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Grievance Arbitration and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">See</span> Ferby at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the agreement in the instant case simply contains no explicit waiver of appeal rights. Rather it provides only for withdrawal of "the subject appeal." While this provision may be subject to an interpretation which includes both the original appeal and any future appeal, use of the term "is withdrawn" implies a reference to the existing appeal only. When the additional terms are also considered, that repeated misconduct "will result in removal" and that the agreement constitutes "a last chance opportunity," the implication of the first term does not change. The agency has pointed to no evidence of record showing that the words "last chance" were defined by agency regulation or the parties to mean a waiver of future appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, there is no statement signed by the appellant indicating that he knew that he was waiving his appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board. At best, the agreement is ambiguous on the matter. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the administrative judge erred in reading into the agreement a provision that the appellant voluntarily forever[2] waived all appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the instant agreement contains no time limitation with respect to the effect of repeated misconduct and that appellant here was removed approximately fifteen months after signing it. Because we find that the agreement does not provide for a waiver of appeal rights, we do not address the propriety of any such waiver in perpetuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, finding no other language in the agreement limiting the Board's scope of review of a second removal action, we conclude that the appellant is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the merits of the instant removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agreement may be ambiguous as to what the appellant is giving up--his right to continue the appeal that first led him to the Board, or the right to appeal a subsequent removal based on a violation of the LCA. The Board then does its best to construe the meaning of the agreement through its language and the conduct of the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brin v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 549, 552 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3138) (agreement that a 30-day suspension would be held in abeyance, with an appeal right as to compliance with the agreement if a suspension were placed into effect, waived an appeal from a suspension even though the agreement also stated that the employee could appeal a contested discipline for subsequent acts); <span id="Page_1131"></span><span class="Italic">Wesley v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 277, 282 &#x00B6; 10 (2003) (agreement providing that the appellant withdrew appeals to the Board did not constitute a waiver of appeal rights from a future removal action resulting from the violation of an LCA).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the waiver of an appeal is based on ambiguous language in a settlement reached before the filing of the appeal, a hearing may be required so that the AJ can receive parol evidence concerning the meaning of the language in the agreement that is argued by the agency to preclude the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 145, 150-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17 (2003) (agreement was not an LCA, but the waiver of the appeal was apparently conditional and the language of the agreement was ambiguous as to precisely what was being waived).

<p class="Body-Text">If an LCA does not reinstate a prior removal action that was held in abeyance, but the agency proposes removal for violation based a new charge of violation of the LCA, the employee has a Board appeal right, <span class="Italic">MacGarvey v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-10-0190-I-1 (NP 3/25/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the language of the notice of proposed removal and decision notice, the agency did not simply reinstate a prior removal action that had been held in abeyance; rather, it proposed the appellant's removal based on a new charge of violation of the LCA. Accordingly, in order to prevail in this appeal, the agency must prove its charge by preponderant evidence as in any other chapter 75 removal case. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of Justice,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 13 (2004). Thus, the issue before the Board is the administrative judge's determination that the agency proved by preponderant evidence its charge that the appellant violated the LCA by incurring more than four unscheduled absences within a 6-month period. We find the agency did not prove its charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an LCA may provide for waiver of all appeal rights if the LCA is invoked against the appellant, some LCAs permit a Board appeal that is limited to the question of whether the LCA was violated, and then the Board has jurisdiction to consider affirmative defenses, <span class="Italic">Barber v. USPS,</span> CH-0752-10-0277-I-1 (NP 12/17/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The LCA also provided that the penalty for any violation of the LCA would be removal, that there would be no mitigation of the penalty, and that any subsequent appeal would be limited solely to the question of whether the appellant violated the LCA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board is not foreclosed from considering the merits of the charges--<span class="Italic">e.g</span>., did the appellant violate the LCA. Therefore, the Board may also consider the appellant's affirmative defense of racial discrimination. <span class="Italic">See generally Martin</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 657 (a complete waiver of Board appeal rights to challenge the merits of the underlying action necessarily deprives the Board of jurisdiction to consider an appellant's affirmative defenses). <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fassett v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 137, 140-41 (1997), presented a settlement agreement that terminated the litigation of one case but did not state that the appellant waived appeal rights as to future agency action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documents signed by the appellant, even assuming that they should be deemed incorporated into the settlement agreements signed by his union representative and the agency's management representative, do not state that he is waiving his appeal rights from any disciplinary action taken by the agency for his violation of the agreements. They merely state, individually, that a "full and final settlement" of the grievance has occurred and that the settlement "terminates" all appeal procedures. The word "terminate" means to come to (or bring to) an end, or to discontinue. WEBSTER'S NINTH NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 1217 (1990). Thus, "terminate" refers to matters that have already commenced, rather than matters that would commence in the future. We therefore find that these documents may not reasonably be construed as waiving the appellant's appeal rights regarding any future actions by the agency.[2] <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 270, 275 (1996) (where the settlement agreement merely provided for the withdrawal of the pending appeal and for waiver of his right to further appeal "the matters raised" or "arising from the actions involved in this appeal," the Board concurred in the AJ's finding that the appellant did not waive his appeal rights from any future agency action); <span class="Italic">Riese v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 364, 367 (1988) (where the settlement agreement provided only for the withdrawal of the "subject appeal," the Board noted that the "use of the term 'is withdrawn' implies a reference to the existing appeal only," and found that the appellant did not waive his appeal rights from future agency actions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note two examples of settlement language which the Board has found constituted waivers of future Board appeal rights. In <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 MSPR 434, 437 (1993), the appellant agreed in the settlement agreement that "[d]uring the next two years," he would "knowingly and voluntarily waive [his]rights in any disciplinary actions taken by the [agency]for violating this agreement," including "appeal rights to MSPB [Merit Systems Protection Board], EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], the courts, any negotiated or agency grievance procedures or any other forum." In <span class="Italic">Ferby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 453 (1985), the appellant agreed in the settlement agreement that "[a]ppeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Grievance-Arbitration and Equal Employment Opportunity complaint procedures are waived during this one (1) year probationary period on any disciplinary action against [him]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the settlement documents are simply silent regarding the appellant's <span class="Italic">future</span> appeal rights. The fact that an agreement is silent regarding a particular matter does not mean that it is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See DeLuna v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 526, 530 (1993). Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the documents are ambiguous, so that parol evidence may be considered, there is no record evidence or argument that parol evidence showed that the appellant waived his future appeal rights. The appellant contended below that he did not waive his future appeal rights, and the agency has not alleged or shown, based on parol evidence, that he intended to waive his Board appeal rights from any future actions taken by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the appellant did not waive his right to file this Board appeal and that the Board has jurisdiction to review the merits of the agency's action....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fassett</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Ellis v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 675, 677 (1998), concluding that an LCA waived appeal rights as to a disciplinary action initially proposed, but not as to the subject of the appeal--a disciplinary action subsequently imposed for violation of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the LCSA is "clear on [its]face" regarding the appellant's waiver of his Board appeal rights. We disagree. The LCSA does not state that the appellant waives his appeal rights from any disciplinary action taken by the agency for any alleged violation of the agreement. Indeed, it does not mention future appeal rights. To the contrary, the LCSA's only provision regarding the appellant's waiver of appeal rights specifically refers only to the agency's September 8, 1994 Notice of Proposed Removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The LCSA is simply silent regarding the appellant's <span class="Italic">future</span> appeal rights. The fact that an agreement is silent regarding a particular matter does not mean that it is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See De Luna v. Department of the Navy,</span> 58 MSPR 526, 530 (1993). Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the LCSA is ambiguous, so that parol evidence may be considered, there is no record evidence or argument that showed that the appellant waived his future appeal rights. The agency has not even asserted that the appellant intended to waive his Board appeal rights regarding any future agency actions or that, as a result, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. In fact, as noted above, in the decision letter effecting the appellant's removal for his alleged violation of the LCSA, the agency specifically informed him that he had the right to appeal the removal decision to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find no basis on which the LCSA can reasonably be construed as waiving the appellant's appeal rights regarding any future actions by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Fassett v. United States Postal Service</span>, 76 MSPR 137, 139-41 (settlement agreement, which stated that agreement was full and final settlement of grievance that terminates all appeal procedures, did not waive employee's rights to appeal any disciplinary action taken by agency for his violation of agreement, where agreement was silent as to employee's future appeal rights in event of violation of agreement), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 132 F.3d 49 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table); <span class="Italic">Coleman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the Board has jurisdiction to review the merits of the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Fassett,</span> 76 MSPR at 141; <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, 71 MSPR at 275.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 78 MSPR 594, 597-99 (1998), involved an LCA that did not effectively waive the right to appeal an adverse action imposed after an alleged infraction of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pivotal issue in this appeal was whether the LCA contained a provision waiving the appellant's right to appeal the agency's April 25, 1997 removal action to the Board. On petition for review, the appellant disputes the administrative judge's finding that the LCA contained such a waiver and, in the alternative, reasserts his claim that if such a waiver existed, it was ambiguous in several respects. In dismissing the appellant's appeal on jurisdictional grounds, the administrative judge found that a provision in the parties' LCA explicitly stated that he waived "'all' appeals pertaining to his October 4th removal." Further, she found that such an interpretation was logical in light of the agency's agreement to hold that removal in abeyance and a reading of that provision in the context of other provisions of the LCA. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1132"></span>It is well settled that a waiver of a statutory right must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive. <span class="Italic">Etheridge v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 53, 56 (1995); <span class="Italic">Roberson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 173, 175 (1987). The LCA read, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Management agrees to hold the proposed removal in abeyance. Should Mr. Smith fail to...the removal will be imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">ON THE PART OF BOTH PARTIES:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The employee and the agency agree that the above stated terms constitute the entire agreement and settles [sic]and concludes [sic]all disputes, appeals, and any other legal, personnel and administrative actions, including EEO and ULP complaints, grievances and litigation in any forum pertaining to the above cited action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as the appellant argued below and reasserts on review, we find no language in these provisions that could be construed to mean that he waived his Board appeal rights from any disciplinary action that the agency might impose for any future violation of the LCA. As the administrative judge found, it reasonably could be inferred from the term "all," that a Board appeal was among the actions referred to in the second provision. No language, however, supports her further conclusion that the "clear and unambiguous language of the agreement, as well as the context of other provisions," evidence the appellant's waiver of his right to appeal the removal at issue. Indeed, the administrative judge herself found that the phrase "above cited action" referred to the previously proposed and decided removal action and that the parties contemplated that their agreement "settle[d]" and "conclud[ed]" that action. Under Board law, this factual finding precludes a determination that the LCA explicitly set forth a waiver of the appellant's right to file a Board appeal from any subsequent adverse agency actions. <span class="Italic">See Ellis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 675, 677 (1998) (LCA's only provision regarding the appellant's waiver of appeal rights specifically referred only to the agency's notice of proposed removal and was silent regarding the appellant's future appeal rights); <span class="Italic">Fassett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 76 MSPR 137, 140 (1997) (while the term "Merit System Protection Board" did appear in the settlement documents at issue, the documents otherwise merely included the phrase "terminates all appeal procedures," which could not reasonably be construed as a waiver of the appellant's future Board appeal rights from the agency's action, in light of the dictionary meaning of "terminate" and the absence of language indicating the appellant's intent to waive his right of appeal from the agency's action for his violation of their agreement), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 132 F.3d 49 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as the appellant points out and we noted in <span class="Italic">Fassett</span>, the LCA provision at issue lacks the typical language which indicates that he understood that he was waiving his Board appeal rights. 76 MSPR at 140 n.2, <span class="Italic">citing Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 MSPR 434, 437 (1993) (the appellant agreed in the settlement that "[d]uring the next two years," he would "knowingly and voluntarily waive [his rights] in any disciplinary actions taken by the [agency]for violating this agreement," including "appeal rights to the MSPB [Merit Systems Protection Board], EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], the courts, any negotiated or agency grievance procedures or any other forum"); <span class="Italic">Ferby v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 26 MSPR 451, 453 (1985) (the appellant agreed in the settlement agreement that "[a]ppeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Grievance-Arbitration and Equal Employment Opportunity complaint procedures are waived during this one (1) year probationary period on any disciplinary action against [him].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we find that the LCA was simply silent regarding the appellant's <span class="Italic">future</span> appeal rights. The fact that an agreement is silent regarding a particular matter does not mean that it is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See De Luna v. Department of the Navy,</span> 58 MSPR 526, 530 (1993). Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the LCA is ambiguous, so that parol evidence may be considered, the record in this case is void of such evidence. We also are not persuaded, as was the administrative judge, that the agency's agreement to hold the appellant's prior removal in abeyance necessarily signaled a waiver of Board appeal rights in connection with the removal action now at issue. Nor do we find that the agency's reimposition of the prior removal action without providing the appellant with notice of his Board appeal rights, evidenced a waiver of those rights in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the appellant did not waive his right to file this Board appeal, that the Board has jurisdiction to review the merits of the agency's action, and that the appellant should be afforded an opportunity to address the merits on remand, including his affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">See Ellis,</span> 77 MSPR at 677-78; <span class="Italic">Fassett</span>, 76 MSPR at 141. The appellant's additional claim on review that the administrative judge erred in deciding the waiver issue before addressing his nonfrivolous allegation that he did not breach the LCA, is correct. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Gibbons v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 74 MSPR 33, 36 (1997)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. DOJ</span>, 96 MSPR 498, 501-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-17 (2004), provides another example of an agreement that was probably intended to foreclose future appeals but that did not properly waive an appeal based on alleged misconduct during the period covered by the LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There are two ways that a party may prove that the other party breached: a party may breach a LCSA either by acting in bad faith or by failing to comply with the agreement in a material way<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our next task is to examine the scope of any waiver of appeal rights contained in the LCSA to determine whether the waiver can be enforced<span class="Italic">. Stewart,</span> 926 F.2d at 1148. It is well settled that a waiver of a statutory right, such as the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive<span class="Italic">. Lockridge v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 613, 620 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 F.3d 727 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ found that the appellant did not waive his right to appeal a removal action arising under the LCSA. The settlement agreement provided that the appellant retained the right to contest before the Warden whether he breached the agreement. The agreement further provided that the appellant waived his right to pursue any type of grievance, appeal, or complaint with regard to the proposed removal underlying the agreement. However, the AJ correctly found that the agreement did not contain a clear and unequivocal waiver of the appellant's right to appeal a removal action based on a future breach of the agreement. The AJ also correctly found that the agency's having included, in the decision notice, a statement of appeal rights to the Board constitutes evidence that the appeal waiver in the agreement did not cover the current removal because, if it did, there would have been no reason for the agency to include that statement of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Alexander v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 264 F.3d 1067, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we find that, according to the language of the notice of proposed removal and decision notice, the agency did not simply reinstate the prior removal action which had been held in abeyance under the LCSA. Instead, the agency proposed the appellant's removal on a new charge of "Violation of settlement agreement" and afforded him all required due process and statutorily-required procedural protections that are applicable in adverse actions taken under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, including an analysis of whether the penalty of removal is reasonable under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). Accordingly, in order to prevail in this appeal, the agency must prove its charge by preponderant evidence as in any other chapter 75 removal case<span class="Italic">. Lockridge</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 620. Based on the fact-findings noted above, we find that the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the AJ's finding that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of race discrimination. The appellant provided no evidence that other employees who violated a LCSA or committed misconduct similar to the appellant's misconduct received favorable treatment. In fact, the parties stipulated that no employees had been disciplined for refusal to work mandatory overtime since at least 1995. The appellant's mere disagreement with the AJ's findings does not warrant full review of the record by the Board<span class="Italic">. Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133-34 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the AJ found that the appellant had waived his right to contest the agency's penalty determination in any future action taken under the LCSA, and that he was precluded from considering whether the penalty should be mitigated. In so doing, the AJ relied on &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4 and 5 of the LCSA, which both provide, somewhat redundantly, that any future misconduct or breach of the agreement during the term of the agreement will "result in the employee's removal from his position." Further, although &#x00B6; 2 of the agreement refers to the original removal action being held in abeyance &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4 and 5 do not say that the original removal will be reinstated upon the appellant's breach of the agreement. While holding an action in abeyance may imply that the action could be reinstated, an appellant may not waive his rights by implication. A waiver must be clear and unambiguous<span class="Italic">. Lockridge</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 620. We find that this waiver was not, and that the appellant did not waive his right to challenge the propriety of the removal penalty for future misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Tackett</span>. <span class="Italic">Tackett</span>, however, is a case in which the agency reinstated a removal penalty that had been held in abeyance<span class="Italic">. Tackett</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 624 &#x00B6; 8. In this case, the agency did not reinstate a removal penalty previously held in abeyance; instead, it imposed a new removal action taken under the auspices of chapter 75, complete with a full <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis as to the reasonableness of the removal penalty. Although the deciding official testified that he felt constrained by the terms of the agreement to impose a removal penalty, the fact of the matter is that the deciding official did discuss aggravating and mitigating factors in his decision letter, and the agency submitted a copy of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and its table of penalties as part of its response to the appeal. Thus, the AJ erred in finding that he lacked the authority to review the agency's penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It becomes necessary, then, to determine whether the penalty of removal <span id="Page_1133"></span>falls within the bounds of reasonableness. In this regard, the deciding official testified that, but for the LCSA, he would have imposed some penalty short of removal. The record does not, however, reveal what penalty the agency would have imposed had the deciding official not misinterpreted the LCSA. We find that a remand is appropriate for the taking of additional evidence concerning the appropriate penalty to be imposed for the appellant's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hamiter v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 511, 514-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-17 (2004), described another LCA gang agley [gone awry] for what appeared to be ineffective drafting of the provision of the agreement describing the scope of the appeal rights waiver:</p>

To establish that a waiver of appeal rights in a settlement agreement should not be enforced, an appellant must show one of the following: he complied with the agreement; the agency materially breached the agreement; he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or, the agreement was the result of fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. See Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Covington v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of a waiver of appeal rights in the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency contends that the appellant breached the agreement by incurring unauthorized overtime after being told to go home at the end of his regular tour of duty. The appellant contends that his tour of duty on the day in dispute ended at 3:50 <small>P.M.</small>, not 4:00 <small>P.M.</small>, as the agency alleged. He asserted that, at 4:10 <small>P.M.</small>, Acting Supervisor Rick Melvin instructed him to clock out and go home, which he did as soon as he gathered his personal belongings. The appellant supported his assertions with an affidavit and with unsworn witness statements. Thus, the appellant made nonfrivolous allegations that he did not breach the LCSA, which he supported with documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this point, it is not clear when the appellant actually clocked out on the day in question. The agency's Notice of Proposed Removal states that he clocked out at "1634 hours," but also states that it was at 4:20 <small>P.M.</small> Since the agency refers to "1550" as 3:50 <small>P.M.</small>, it would seem that "1634" would be 4:34 <small>P.M.</small> On remand, the AJ shall take evidence as to when, and under what circumstances, the appellant clocked out.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, at this stage of his appeal, is not required to prove that he complied with the settlement agreement; he need only nonfrivolously allege it<span class="Italic">.

If the appellant is able to prove that he complied with Mr. Harvey's instructions within a reasonable time of receiving them, and that he otherwise did not incur unauthorized overtime on the day in question, then he will have shown that he did not breach the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Covington</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612 &#x00B6; 15. Because the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation of compliance with the LCSA, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing to determine whether he, in fact, complied with the settlement agreement so that the LCSA's Board appeal rights waiver should not be enforced against him<span class="Italic">. See Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1149; <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 742 F.2d at 1428.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After determining whether the appellant breached the LCSA, the Board must determine the scope and applicability of the LCSA's waiver provision<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148; <span class="Italic">Tackett</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 624 &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Below, the AJ found that, under the LCSA, the appellant had unconditionally waived any right to appeal to the Board. We disagree. The LCSA provides that "in the event" the terms of the agreement "are not met" by the appellant, the appellant would "forgo any appeal through [the Board]." The words "in the event" are conditional; they condition the waiver of Board appeal rights on the finding that the appellant actually breached the LCSA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. Shevin</span>, 407 U.S. 67, 94, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 2001 (1972) (the words "in the event of default of any payment or payments" make the sales contract a conditional contract under which the seller can take back the merchandise only "in the event" of a default); <span class="Italic">Trustees of the Pension, Welfare, and Vacation Fringe Benefit Funds of IBEW Local 701 v. Pyramid Electric</span>, 223 F.3d 459, 464 (7th Cir. 2000) (the district court's order dismissing all claims without prejudice gave plaintiffs "leave to reinstate <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">event</span> that any party breached the Settlement Agreement," thus allowing reinstatement of the claims if there was an alleged breach (emphasis added)). Thus, under the terms of the LCSA, the appellant has the right to appeal to the Board and attempt to prove that he complied with the agreement. If the Board finds that the appellant failed to meet terms and conditions of the LCSA, the LCSA's wavier provision would preclude the Board from obtaining jurisdiction. If, however, the appellant complied with the LCSA, the waiver provision cannot be enforced to prevent the Board from obtaining jurisdiction because the "event" referenced in the LCSA (the appellant's breach) did not occur.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Below, the AJ found that, through the LCSA, the appellant had elected the grievance procedure as the sole forum for any appeal. This the agreement does not provide. Rather, the LCSA provides that, under certain circumstances, the appellant agreed to forego his right to appeal to the Board. A preference-eligible Postal Service employee, like the appellant, who is affected by an action appealable to the Board, has the right to both grieve and appeal the same action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), 7512(1), 7513(d), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; <span class="Italic">Masdea v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 556 &#x00B6; 5 (2002); <span class="Italic">Hall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 233, 235-36 (1985). It is well settled that a waiver of a statutory right must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Lockridge v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 613, 620 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 F.3d 727 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Here, the appellant did not explicitly and unequivocally agree to waive his right to appeal to the Board and only pursue a claim through the grievance procedure. Thus, he is bound by no such limitation on his rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Below, the AJ found that the waiver of Board jurisdiction was triggered by the agency's Notice of Removal, which alleged that the appellant had breached the LCSA. However, the LCSA provides that the appellant waives his Board appeal rights only "in the event of any of the terms and conditions of the [LCSA]are not met and a Notice of Removal issued." The phrase "are not met" makes the appellant's waiver of his Board appeal rights enforceable only if he <span class="Italic">actually breached</span> the agreement, not upon the agency's mere allegation of breach. Thus, the AJ incorrectly determined that the appellant waived his right to appeal his removal to the Board without first determining whether the appellant, in fact, breached the agreement<span class="Italic">. See Gibson</span>, 160 F.3d at 725; <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148; <span class="Italic">Tackett</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 624 &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the AJ's alternative conclusion that the Step 2 grievance decision, which found the appellant actually breached the LCSA, is binding on the Board under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when: (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action, (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action, (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment, and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988). That an issue was "actually litigated" means that the issue must have been contested by the parties and submitted for determination by a court or other neutral adjudicator. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 184, 187 (1997). Here, an agency management official rendered the agency's grievance decision. In effect, then, the appellant presented his case to his opposing party and his opposing party ruled against him. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 187. Under the circumstances, the issue of breach was not "actually litigated" and the grievance decision was not entitled to collateral estoppel effect. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 187.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Washington v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 139, 142-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13 (2002), provides an example of disagreement over operation of an agreement similar to a last chance settlement. The appellant was removed for failure to meet attendance requirements. The parties settled the ensuing appeal with an agreement that the removal would be canceled subject to the appellant's successful completion of a fitness examination and subsequent reinstatement to his position. The agreement stipulated that the appellant's failure to successfully complete the fitness examination "will void this Agreement, and the removal action will be effective." The appeal was dismissed as settled. A few months later, the agency notified the appellant that he would be separated for failing to demonstrate successful completion of the fitness examination required by the settlement. The appellant again appealed. In his appeal the appellant argued that he did not waive his appeal because the agreement was nullified when he failed to pass a fitness examination, meaning that the removal stayed in effect. The AJ determined that the appellant breached the agreement because he did not comply fully with the fitness examination requirement. On PFR the Board determined that the waiver of appeal rights in the settlement did not divest the Board of jurisdiction over Washington's removal because the agreement was no longer effective after the appellant's failure to complete the fitness examination and, as a result, the removal was never canceled; his right to appeal survived the defunct settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not all LCAs are meant to waive appeal rights. Some stipulate that severe discipline (including removal) will occur if conduct described by the agreement again occurs. When those agreements are at issue, the Board essentially regards them as evidence of either past misconduct or explicit <span id="Page_1134"></span>warning against future misconduct. The result is that the chances are slim that the penalty selected by the agency will be mitigated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hart v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 633, 636 (1988). It may be that the appellant did not waive the right to appeal from an adverse action that has not been effectuated pending satisfactory completion of an LCA that documents the appellant's agreement that the conduct initially charged warranted his removal. The appellant may appeal the removal once imposed, but the Board will enforce its terms (assuming appellant's breach of the agreement) by crediting the appellant's agreement that the agency had just cause for imposing removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 196, 200 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Brin v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 549, 550-52 (1991)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wesley v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 277, 288 &#x00B6; 23 (2003) (provision of the agreement stating that the notice of proposed removal was for just cause constituted a stipulation satisfying the agency's burden of proving the underlying cause for removal and the existence of a nexus for the attendance-based removal). The Board construed an LCA to waive an appeal right as to conduct related to the circumstances giving rise to the agreement (drug-related offenses), but not as to other misconduct that was not the principal focus of the agreement (misuse of a government credit card), when the structure of the agreement suggested that appeal rights were not waived for the broader class of offenses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 81 MSPR 537, 542 &#x00B6; 17 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 270, 275, 279 (1996) (discussed in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-212.html#sec16-210">Employee May Be Terminated or Will Resign or Retire on Specified Condition; Agreement Not to Reapply</a>," concerning interpretation of settlements), involved an appellant's agreement that failure to abide by the agreement may be just cause for termination. The appellant did not agree to waive his right to a Board appeal. The settlement was not a customary LCA. The Board required consideration of the ensuing case on the merits, including the appellant's affirmative defenses, e.g., mitigation and harmful error. As to the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant asserted below, and as the administrative judge found in the initial decision, the appellant did not waive his Board appeal rights in the settlement agreement. The appellant merely agreed to withdraw his then-pending appeal and grievances of his removal for delay and obstructing the mail and falsification of an employment application, waive his right to an oral hearing or further appeal "on the matters raised," and not litigate or relitigate in any forum any claims "arising from the actions involved in this appeal." The initial decision, which placed the burden on the agency to show that the appellant had breached the agreement, is consistent with Board decisions that have treated appeals resulting from alleged violations of settlement agreements that do not contain waivers of Board appeal rights as petitions for appeal that are within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 196, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 11 F.3d 1073 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Riese v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 364 (1988)....</p>
