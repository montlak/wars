<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-104"><span class="space">3.</span> Time, Method of Election</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The method and timing of elections for survivor annuities are governed, in part, by 5 USC 8339 (CSRS), and 5 CFR 831.613; 831.631-32 (2022), and for FERS by 5 USC 8416-17 and 5 CFR 842.601-.612 (2022). These and other sections of the U.S. Code and CFR are referenced in the decisions that follow.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The survivor annuity election is to go to OPM, not to an employing agency. This is a distinction that becomes important when there is a statutory deadline for its receipt by OPM, <span class="Italic">Ostrander v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 147, 150-51 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in not finding that the two-year time limit applied to her husband's election of a survivor annuity. The administrative judge correctly found, however, that the one-year time limit applied to the appellant's situation because the appellant retired before May 7, 1985, and, as explained below, did not apply for a survivor annuity until after November 9, 1985. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.613(a)(1) and (2)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next asserts that the June 1985 submission to the postal service was a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> signed election, and that the government should be estopped from denying the appellant a survivor annuity because of the wrongful conduct of its agents. We have reopened this case because the Board recently addressed these issues in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 527 (1991). In that case, the Board first held that the appellant's filing of a disability retirement application with her former employing agency did not constitute a constructive filing with OPM because the applicable statutory provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), specifically required that the application be filed with OPM within the one-year time limit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 529.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in this case, the applicable statutory provision required that Mr. Ostrander's election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity be "received in the Office" within one year of his marriage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2) (1980). The term "Office" is identified in 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 8339(j) (1980) as OPM. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.104(a). Furthermore, the OPM form that the appellant completed to elect a reduced annuity with survivor benefit clearly stated that his election must be received by "us" within one year of his marriage to be valid. Thus, we find that the June 1985 submission to the postal service cannot be considered a constructive filing with OPM, and accordingly, the application was not filed within the one-year time limit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With some exceptions subsequently discussed, the time for electing a survivor annuity upon marriage following retirement is inflexible. The Board would not extend the time for election because the appellant did not realize that an annuity was necessary for the spouse to secure health insurance, <span class="Italic">Ciccolo v. OPM,</span> PH-0843-14-0540-I-1 (NP 4/2/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Nearly 5 years after the marriage, on May 17, 2013, the appellant requested waiver of the filing deadline to elect a survivor annuity, asserting that he applied for health insurance for his spouse subsequent to the marriage but was not aware that he also needed to elect survivor annuity benefits in order for her to continue to receive health insurance benefits if he predeceased her....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute and regulations provide that, when a federal annuitant is unmarried at the time of his retirement under FERS but marries after retirement, he may elect to provide a survivor annuity for his spouse within 2 years after his marriage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8416(c)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.612. In the instant case, it is undisputed that the appellant did not elect a survivor annuity for his spouse before the end of the 2-year deadline. It is also undisputed that the appellant received the required annual notices sent to all annuitants by OPM informing him of his right to make an election for a survivor annuity within the statutory 2-year deadline under FERS. However, the appellant requests waiver of the filing deadline on the ground that OPM did not timely inform him that, in order for his spouse to continue to receive health insurance benefits after his death, he must have elected a survivor annuity for her within 2 years of the marriage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation may provide for a waiver under specified circumstances; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline, where such notice is required by statute or regulation, may warrant a waiver of the deadline. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). Under the FERS statutes and regulations, however, there is no allowance for waiver under the circumstances present here, nor is there any requirement that OPM provide notice to FERS annuitants concerning health care benefits rights for surviving spouses. <span class="Italic">See Larson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 8 (2003); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. chapter 84. Further, the appellant does not allege, and the record does not show, that OPM misled him into believing that his spouse's health care benefits would continue after his death without making a survivor annuity election. While we are sympathetic to the appellant's situation, it is well established that the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law even if the denial of benefits may seem unfair to the individual. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990). Thus, as correctly determined by the administrative judge, the appellant has failed to establish any basis for waiver of the 2-year filing deadline under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8416(c)(1).</p>

As to OPM's effort to overcome the presumption:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether OPM's denial of receipt of an election of survivor annuity is sufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt in due course. Presumption has been defined as "a rule of law, statutory or judicial, by which finding of a basic fact gives rise to existence of a presumed fact, until presumption is rebutted." <span class="Italic">Wilner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM provides no evidence to support its assertion that Walsh did not file a timely request for a survivor annuity for the appellant. Although the record evidence includes an affidavit from OPM officials that sets forth its routine business practice of mailing notices that advise annuitants of the deadline for requesting survivor annuities, OPM did not provide any evidence of its business practice with regard to the receipt of mail. OPM's bare assertion, that the appellant is not entitled to a survivor annuity because the record does not include a timely filed request, fails to meet the requirements for overcoming the presumption of receipt. Accordingly, we find that Mr. Walsh filed a timely election of survivor benefits for the appellant with OPM. OPM's reconsideration decision therefore is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because to establish a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement an election must be submitted by the annuitant to OPM within two years by marriage, under the analysis of <span class="Italic">Diehl v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 519, 521-22 (1991), it is not sufficient for the spouse to submit the election, signed by the annuitant, within two years of the marriage but after the annuitant's death:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8341(b) of Title 5, United States Code, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[I]f an employee or Member dies after having retired under this subchapter and is survived by a widow or widower, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity...unless...the employee or Member did not file an election under section 8339(j)(5)(C) or section 8339(k)(2) of this title....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8339(k)(2)(A) of Title 5, United States Code, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">An employee or Member, who is unmarried at the time of retiring under a provision of law which permits election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity payable to such employee or Member's spouse and who later marries, may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received in the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries...a reduction in the retired employee or Member's current annuity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.613(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The quoted statutory sections provide that, for an election to be valid, it must be received in the Office of Personnel Management within the two-year statutory period. The statute, however, is silent, as is the implementing regulation, on the question of whether the election must be filed during the employee or Member's lifetime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM interprets the statute as providing, not only that it is the employee or Member who must make the election, but also that the election does not occur, that is, does not become irrevocable, until the employee or Member files it with OPM within two years of the marriage. Thus, according to OPM's interpretation, the right to make the election in this case terminated with the death of Mr. Diehl.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. It is well settled that the right to determine whether to take a full annuity and thereby deny a survivor's annuity to a spouse is "'personal' to the employee 'alone.'"<span class="Italic">Roebling v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 788 F.2d 1544, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Since the election is not deemed to be irrevocably made until it is received by OPM, and since only the employee or retiree can make the election, we agree with OPM that no election can be made after the employee or retiree dies. <span class="Italic">See also Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 918 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 340 (no legal basis to award survivors' annuity to the heir of a survivor who did not claim her annuity during her lifetime).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Alleged mental incapacity of the annuitant is insufficient to waive the two-year deadline for electing a survivor annuity after marriage, <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9496523177942480571&q=587+F.3d+1111&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">180 F.3d 1377</a>, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Schoemakers contends that, even if Mr. Schoemakers received the notice, because of her husband's "mental state" at the time the notices were sent--her affidavit stated that he had "problems...with memory" and from "alcohol usage"--she was entitled to a waiver of the two-year statutory period for requesting a survivor's annuity. Although the Board stated that Mr. Schoemakers' "mental condition...appears to have interfered with his ability to read and understand the OPM notices that he received," it correctly held that Mrs. Schoemakers was not entitled to a waiver of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute unambiguously states that to obtain a survivor's annuity the annuitant must file with OPM "a signed writing...within two years after such employee...marries." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k) (2) (A). Nothing in either the language or the legislative history even suggests, much less indicates, that Congress intended to permit waiver of the filing deadline because of the annuitant's mental condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where Congress intended to permit the waiver of filing deadlines for government annuitants because of their mental problems, it explicitly so provided. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), an application for a disability annuity must be "filed with [OPM] before the employee...is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter." Congress further provided that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]his time limitation may be waived by [OPM] for an employee...who at the date of separation from service or within one year thereafter is mentally incompetent [.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This provision stands in sharp contrast to the unequivocal requirement of filing within two years of marriage in &#x00A7; 8339(k) (2) (A). It strongly indicates that Congress did not intend to permit waiver of that requirement because of the annuitant's mental condition. The cases on which Mrs. Schoemakers relies, in which agencies excused untimely filings for "good cause," involved time limits imposed by the agency's own regulations, not a deadline provided by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the Board's administrative judge, we sympathize with Mrs. Schoemakers' plight. Neither courts nor administrative agencies, however, have the authority to waive requirements (including filing deadlines) that Congress has imposed as a condition to the payment of federal money. <span class="Italic">See Crown v. United States R.R. Retirement Bd</span>., 811 F.2d 1017, 1020 (7th Cir. 1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">Gressley v. Califano</span>, 609 F.2d 1265. 1267 (7th Cir. 1979) ("A congressional mandate to pay statutory benefits...leaves no discretion in the agencies and courts but to limit the payment of benefits to those entitled to them.")). In &#x00A7; 8339(k) (2) (A), Congress provided that an unmarried federal annuitant who marries may provide a survivor's annuity for his spouse only if he applies therefore within two years of marriage. Since Mr. Schoemakers did not do that, the Board correctly refused to provide Mrs. Schoemakers with a survivor's annuity.</p>
