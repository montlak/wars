<h2 class="h2" id="sec4-61"><span class="space">V.</span> ISSUES NOT APPROPRIATE FOR NEGOTIABILITY APPEALS</h2>
<p class="noindent">In a negotiability appeal FLRA decides only the negotiability issues presented under 5 USC 7117, 5 USC 7105(a)(2)(D), and 7106. That is, FLRA asks: does a proposal concern conditions of employment for bargaining unit employees; does it conflict with law or government-wide rule or regulation; does it conflict with an agency regulation supported by a compelling need; does it conflict with a nonnegotiable management right; is it within the realm of a negotiable procedure or arrangement?</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency raises negotiability issues and duty to bargain issues, the negotiability appeal process is properly invoked to resolve the former set of issues. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 27 FLRA 460, 461 (1987), involving allegations both that the agency was not required to bargain because of an existing contract and that the union's proposals were nonnegotiable as contrary to law, rule, and regulation, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_450"></span>The Agency contends that it has no duty to bargain over the Union's proposals because there has been no change in Agency policy or practice regarding the use of pseudonyms. The Agency further asserts that it has no obligation to bargain over proposals initiated by the Union during the term of the collective bargaining agreement which are unrelated to Agency-initiated changes in conditions of employment. These contentions do not preclude our consideration of the negotiability appeal in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7117(c) of the Statute, a union is entitled to a decision by the Authority as to whether a proposal is negotiable under the Statute despite the existence of other issues in the case. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2736 v. FLRA</span>, 715 F.2d 627, 631 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Further, to the extent that there are issues regarding the duty to bargain in the specific circumstances of this case--such as whether there is an obligation to bargain over proposals initiated by the Union during the term of the parties' agreement which are unrelated to Agency-initiated changes in condition of employment--these issues should be resolved in other appropriate proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2736 and Department of the Air Force, Headquarters, 379th Combat Support Group (SAC), Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan</span>, 14 FLRA 302 at 306 n.6 (1984)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See NFFE, Forest Serv. Council and USDA, Forest Serv., Region 6, Portland</span>, 45 FLRA 242, 246-47 (1992) ("The claim that a proposal conflicts with a higher-level agreement does not prevent our determining the negotiability of a proposal when the proposal's negotiability under the Statute is also at issue.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties may resolve questions concerning the duty to bargain based on factual issues in ULP or grievance and arbitration procedures, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-184 and VAMC Lexington</span>, 51 FLRA 386, 399-401 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that it satisfied its duty to bargain over the subject matter contained in Proposal 3 when it agreed to Article 13 of the parties' agreement. In support of its argument that Article 13 covers the issue of expanding the hours of the part-time dental assistant, the Agency has submitted Article 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has routinely declined to address duty to bargain issues in negotiability decisions, stating that those issues could be raised in "other appropriate proceedings." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2736 and Department of the Air Force, Headquarters 379th</span> <span class="Italic">Combat Support Group (SAC), Wurtsmith Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Michigan</span>, 14 FLRA 302, 306 n.6 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Wurtsmith), on remand</span> <span class="Italic">from American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2736 v. FLRA</span>, 715 F.2d 627, 631 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>) (ruling that a union is entitled to expedited review under section 7117(c) of all negotiability issues despite the existence of other issues regarding disputed proposals). However, in light of a recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>), we explain why we decline to decide the Agency's duty to bargain argument at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, following the agency head's disapproval of an interest arbitrator's award, the Authority rendered a negotiability decision in response to the union's appeal. The Authority, following its normal practice, declined to consider numerous duty to bargain challenges raised by the agency. The court criticized the Authority for refusing to decide and deferring the duty to bargain issues to "some still-unspecified time and place." 26 F.3d at 1152. The court relied on the fact that in its remedial order, the Authority "held that '[t]hose provisions [found] negotiable <span class="Italic">will be</span> included in the parties' agreement.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1152-53, quoting the Authority's Decision and Order in <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce</span>, <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 19 (1993) (emphasis supplied by the court). The court noted that, having been directed to include the still-disputed provisions in its agreement, the parties in <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span> were confused by the Authority's determination that duty to bargain issues be resolved "in some unidentified, 'other appropriate proceedings.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The contested remedy and alleged confusion caused by the Authority's Order in <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span> are not present in the case we decide today. First, as noted in Section III.C., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, to the extent that we find the proposals at issue negotiable at the election of the Agency, we dismiss them pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.10(b). Second, there should be no uncertainty concerning the process through which the duty to bargain issue would be resolved in this case. If the Union seeks to bargain over this proposal in the future, and the Agency refuses to bargain based on an assertion that Article 13 foreclosed further bargaining, the Union could then file either an unfair labor practice charge or, provided the matter has not been excluded from its scope, a grievance under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. In such a case, the issue could be resolved based on a full evidentiary record applying the approach for resolving such issues set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 17 FLRA 550, 551 n.* (1985), if the agency's defense to negotiations is that there is nothing to bargain about because there has been no change in working conditions, the duty to bargain issue is to be litigated in a ULP case and the agency would be ordered to bargain on the proposals advanced by the union. Although it did not explain exactly how it was doing so, FLRA distinguished its 1985 decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 FLRA 768, 769-70 (1987), but still determined that it would dismiss a negotiability appeal when there was no real dispute over negotiability but there was an underlying dispute over the duty to bargain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that it has no duty to bargain concerning various proposals in this case because they are governed by provisions in the parties' Agreement or because no change has been made in the areas covered by the proposals sufficient to give rise to a duty to bargain. Due to the claimed existence of threshold issues concerning the duty to bargain, the Agency contends that the Authority has no jurisdiction to decide the proposals in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the conditions for review of negotiability issues have been met, a union is entitled to a decision by the Authority as to whether a proposal is negotiable under the Statute, despite the existence of additional issues in the case, for example, an alleged conflict between a proposal and a controlling agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2736 v. FLRA</span>, 715 F.2d 627, 631 (D.C. Cir. 1983)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A different situation is presented, however, for proposals as to which threshold duty to bargain issues are raised but for which the conditions for review of negotiability issues have not been met....&#8197;Specifically,...the Agency contends only that the subject matter of these proposals is covered by the parties' Agreement and that there is no duty to bargain because management is neither proposing nor effecting any changes in the areas encompassed by these proposals. The Agency does not argue that these proposals are inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 2424.1 of our Regulations, we will consider a petition for review of a negotiability issue only where the parties are in dispute as to whether a proposal is inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. In this case,...there is no issue before us as to whether [the] [p]roposals...are inconsistent with law, rule or regulation. Therefore, we have no issues to consider as to those proposals in this negotiability proceeding. In these circumstances, the conditions governing review of negotiability issues...have not been met. Moreover, as we noted above, other issues concerning [the] [p]roposals...--whether the subject matter of those proposals is covered by the parties' Agreement or whether management has proposed or effected a change in the areas covered by those proposals so as to give rise to a duty to bargain--should be resolved in other appropriate proceedings, such as the parties' negotiated grievance procedure or the unfair labor practice procedures under section 7118 of the Statute. Therefore, we will dismiss the Union's petition for review as to those proposals, without prejudice to the Union's right to file a negotiability appeal if the conditions governing review of negotiability issues are met and if the Union chooses to file such an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that previous decisions of the Authority suggest that in similar circumstances--where the conditions governing review have not been met--we would consider these proposals, those decisions will not be followed. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 12, AFL-CIO, and Department of Labor</span>, 17 FLRA 550 (1985). As to the remaining proposals in this case, the Agency alleges that they are inconsistent with law and/or Government-wide regulation; those proposals are properly before us and we will now resolve their negotiability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1987 <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span> decision was followed in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1900 and DHUD</span>, 33 FLRA 192, 194-95 (1988). FLRA declined to rule on a negotiability dispute when the agency contended that it was not obliged to bargain because the disputed wording conflicted with the terms of the parties' existing negotiated agreement. There was no true issue of nonnegotiability, only a dispute over the obligation to bargain in good faith:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not argue that the disputed wording is inconsistent with law, rule or regulation. The Agency argues only that the wording in question modifies a right granted to it by the parties' negotiated agreement and that such modification is foreclosed by the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with section 7117 of the Statute and Part 2424 of our Rules and Regulations, we will consider a petition for review of a negotiability issue only where the parties disagree over whether a proposal is inconsistent with law, rule or regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the conditions for review of a negotiability appeal have been met, a union is entitled to a decision from us on whether a disputed proposal is negotiable under the Statute, although additional issues may exist, including, for example, whether an agency is obligated to bargain under the terms of a master agreement....&#8197;To the extent that there are additional issues, beyond those concerning a proposal's negotiability under the Statute, regarding the duty to bargain in the specific circumstances of a case, those issues should be resolved in other appropriate proceedings....&#8197;Accordingly, the claimed existence of <span id="Page_451"></span>threshold duty to bargain questions does not prevent our determining the negotiability of proposals when the proposals' negotiability under the Statute is also at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A different question is presented, however, when the duty to bargain question is the only issue presented to us in a negotiability appeal....&#8197;[T]here is no issue before us as to whether the disputed wording conflicts with law, rule or regulation, and there is no dispute appropriate for resolution in a negotiability appeal. Consequently, the conditions for review as described in Part 2424 of our Rules and Regulations have not been met and the appeal will be dismissed, without prejudicing the Union's right to file a later negotiability appeal, should it elect to do so, if the conditions governing review are met.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS, Ogden Serv. Ctr.</span>, 12 FLRA 314, 315 (1983) (dismissing negotiability appeal when agency maintained that it had no obligation to bargain, e.g., either changes were consistent with relevant provisions of agreement or no local working conditions had in fact been changed; dispute was over obligation to bargain, to be resolved through grievance arbitration or ULP procedures); <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 3 FLRA 330, 331 (1980) (dismissing appeal: "the essence of the parties' allegations and contentions relates to whether a past practice has been changed by the implementation of guidelines detailed in a manual supplement"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq., AFLC</span>, 2 FLRA 408, 409-10 (1980) (dismissing petition: "it is clear that the essence of the contentions and arguments of the parties principally relates to whether, under the particular circumstances here presented, the activity has unilaterally changed a past practice and established a new working condition").</p>
<p class="noindent">The same was true when the union contended that the employer refused to bargain on an issue, maintaining its nonnegotiability, and the employer insisted that it met its bargaining obligation. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1141 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Mines</span>, 2 FLRA 245, 246 (1979) ("since the instant case arises out of an alleged unilateral change and essentially involves a claim of a refusal to bargain and a defense that the bargaining obligation has been met, the proper forum in which to raise these issues is not a negotiability appeal, but would be an unfair labor practice proceeding"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station</span>, 2 FLRA 182, 183 (1979) (If dispute arose from alleged unilateral change in employment conditions coupled with refusal to bargain, and defense that no change had occurred, proper forum to raise issue was an unfair labor practice proceeding permitting resolution of factual disputes).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the ULP route was used and a determination was made, even at the regional level, that there was no obligation to bargain over a particular matter (either because it had already been negotiated into a contract or because the matter was not negotiable), FLRA would not entertain a negotiability appeal on the same matter. The rationale was that its regulations precluded the issuance of advisory opinions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Hq., San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB</span>, 2 FLRA 419, 419-20 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2736 v. FLRA</span>, 715 F.2d 627, 629-31 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (following remand, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2736 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq. 379th CSG,</span> 14 FLRA 302 (1984)), required FLRA to be clear on how and why it dismissed a negotiability appeal when the agency posited a duty to bargain issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision, rendered more than 15 months after the union filed its negotiability appeal, did not address the issue of the negotiability of the union's...proposals. Instead, in a terse statement the Authority dismissed the union's appeal on the ground that the existence of factual disputes regarding the...proposals required that the entire dispute be processed through either the standard unfair labor practice procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118 (1982) or through the parties' own contractual grievance procedures. Both avenues would entail a hearing to resolve the factual as well as the legal issues in dispute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union argues that...the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c)...require[s] resolution of this dispute through the expedited negotiability appeals procedure....&#8197;[T]he statutory command, as supplemented by the legislative history, is unmistakable. Section 7117(c)(1) states: "Except in any case to which subsection (b) of this section applies, if an agency involved in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative alleges that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to any matter, the exclusive representative may appeal the allegation to the Authority in accordance with the provisions of this subsection."...&#8197;And Section 7117(c)(6) states: "The Authority shall expedite proceedings under this subsection to the extent practicable and shall issue to the exclusive representative and to the agency a written decision on the allegation and specific reasons therefor[&#8197;] at the earliest practicable date." Read together, Sections 7117(c)(1) and 7117(c)(6) entitle the exclusive representative to review of negotiability issues expedited as much as is "practicable"; the decision whether to grant expedited review is not left to the discretion of the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority's decision that both negotiability and factual issues be determined in an unfair labor practice or contractual grievance hearing contravenes the clear statutory mandate of Section 7117(c) that negotiability disputes be processed as expeditiously as practicable. Neither the relevant statute and regulations nor the factual posture of this dispute preclude the Authority from granting expedited review of the negotiability claim while processing the factual dispute regarding the...proposals in some fashion....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore hold that Section 7117(c) entitles the union to expedited review of the negotiability issue in its appeal, but that the Authority has discretion to decide how to process the remaining factual issues regarding the...proposals.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In every prior 7117 proceeding before the Authority where parties have raised combined negotiability and factual issues, the Authority has dismissed the appeal. Our decision today commands that the Authority must entertain the negotiability question under 7117 but intimates no view as to whether the Authority must also dispose of the factual matters through the standard unfair labor practice procedures of 7118. We caution that such an election, if not conducted in an expedited fashion, might serve to impermissibly undermine the congressional mandate of 7117 to process negotiability questions quickly.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result of <span class="Italic">Local 2736</span>, if the conditions for review of negotiability issues have been met, a union is entitled to a negotiability decision despite the existence of additional issues, for example, an alleged conflict between a proposal and a controlling agreement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 FLRA 363, 364-65 (1987); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 11 and Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 32 FLRA 380, 384-85 (1988) (rejecting jurisdictional argument questioning whether negotiability appeal arose from or was product of employer-employee relationship; adding that "a union is entitled to a decision by the Authority as to whether the proposal is negotiable under the Statute even if other issues exists in the case, such as a conflict between the proposal and a controlling agreement"). FLRA noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span>, however, that if the agency does not question whether particular proposals are contrary to law, rule, or regulation, but only contends that there is no duty to bargain because management is neither proposing nor effecting any changes in the area encompassed by the proposals, there is no issue of negotiability; the union is left to grievance or ULP procedures to force bargaining. The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 628, 637 (1987): FLRA will not decide a negotiability case unless there is a dispute concerning whether the proposal is inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation.
