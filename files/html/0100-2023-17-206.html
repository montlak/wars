<p class="noindent">If there is no basis for awarding a promotion, retroactive or prospective, but the agency violated provisions of law, rule, regulation or negotiated agreement in a selection action, other remedies, e.g., awarding priority consideration (or requiring the agency to rerun the selection action), may be appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-106.html">72 FLRA 541</a>, 547 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman DuBester concurring and dissenting in part) ("[T]he Authority has previously held that priority-consideration remedies do not excessively interfere with management's &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i) right, as long as the candidate with priority consideration is not exempt from the minimum qualifications, skills, and abilities that the Agency establishes for any future vacancies. As the awarded remedy does not relieve the grievant of the obligation to demonstrate that he possesses the minimum qualifications, skills, and abilities for future vacancies, we find that the remedy does not excessively interfere with management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i)." (disallowing award of back pay and front pay));<span class="Italic"> VA Stokes Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 31</span>, 64 FLRA 911, 913-14 (2010) (denying exceptions to award granting priority consideration for promotion required by contract); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy and OPEIU Local 2001</span>, 63 FLRA 219 (2009) (sustaining award directing that positions be vacated and that the grievant be given priority consideration when he was given inaccurate information about position, causing him not to apply for job); <span class="Italic">SSA Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 58 FLRA 592, 594 (2003) (sustaining award directing priority consideration based on arbitrator's determination that contract required affirmative action to alleviate under-representation in a particular job classification); <span class="Italic">SSA OHA and AFGE Local 3627</span>, 55 FLRA 834, 836 (1999) (priority consideration was consistent with collective bargaining agreement and did not constitute a prohibited personnel practice or violation of OPM regulations; this decision was discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-193.html#sec9-191">Promotion</a>"); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Aviation Ctr. and AFGE Local 1815</span>, 39 FLRA 865, 869-71 (1991) (same); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 38 FLRA 1573, 1581-88 (1991) (recognizing priority consideration as remedy but rejecting an award that interpreted 38 USC 2014 and 29 USC 791(b) to provide a preference for selection of disabled veterans for promotions without determination that veterans were denied equal competitive opportunities). An award that provides for priority consideration does not require the agency to violate 5 USC 2302(b)(6), making it a prohibited personnel practice to grant any preference or advantage to an employee or applicant for employment for the purpose of improving or injuring any person's prospects for employment, unless the preference or advantage is authorized by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">SSA v. AFGE, Local 3627</span>, 58 FLRA 739, 740 n.5 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">By reason of management's right to select from any appropriate source, an arbitrator who directs a rerun of a promotion cannot limit management to candidates originally considered, although priority consideration may be <span id="page_2055"></span>awarded to original competitors. <span class="Italic">Georgia NG, Ft. Stewart and Georgia ACT Union</span>, 14 FLRA 640, 681 (1984). If an employee was wrongfully denied due process or consideration in a promotion action, and if the employee was not promoted when the grievance was considered, then an appropriate remedy under the former FPM Ch. 335, App. A-4c(2) was to direct that the employee be granted priority consideration for promotion to the next available higher-graded position supported by the employee's qualifications.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving</span> <span class="Italic">and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) <span class="Italic">(BEP). </span>Upon finding that the award affects a management right under section 7106(a) of the Statute, the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II. An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties, as appropriate<span class="Italic">. See U.

<p class="noindent-1">An award that orders an agency to rerun a selection action for a particular position affects management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Panama Canal Commission and Maritime Metal Trades Council, </span>52 FLRA 404, 411-12 (1996). Consequently, the award affects management's right to select, and we must evaluate the award under the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to prong I, the Arbitrator was interpreting Article 26, Section 7.B. of the parties' agreement. The Authority has previously found provisions which require an agency to give priority consideration to employees within a bargaining unit, but that do not prevent management from timely considering other applicants or expanding the area of consideration, to be negotiable procedures under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Laurel Bay Teachers Association, OEA/NEA and U.S. Department of Defense, Stateside Dependents Schools, Laurel Bay Schools, Laurel Bay, South</span> <span class="Italic">Carolina, </span>49 FLRA 679, 687 (1994). Accordingly, we find the award enforces a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b). We therefore proceed to the prong II analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II, the question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy is a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement. Here, the Arbitrator did not order that the grievant be retroactively promoted. Instead, the Arbitrator ruled that the selection process should be rerun to ensure that the Agency gave real and meaningful consideration to the employees on the Union list.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordering an agency to reaccomplish a selection action so as to accord with contractual requirements is an action satisfying prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and</span> <span class="Italic">Appeals and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Council 215, AFL-CIO, </span>54 FLRA 1365, 1373 (1998) (prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>is satisfied when an arbitrator orders a selection rerun which did not conform to law or a collective bargaining agreement).

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the contract does not allow management the right to not select from the Union list, thereby conflicting with &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(4). However, the award requires only that the Agency give real and meaningful consideration to the Union list prior to looking at the entire best qualified list, and does not require the Agency to select from the Union list or the grievant to be selected. As the award does not require the Agency to select from the Union list, or prohibit it from expanding the pool of candidates, the award does not violate 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(4).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not order the grievant retroactively promoted.&#x2003;In addition, the Arbitrator specifically stated, "No back pay is awarded[.]" Although the Arbitrator did not award back pay, he specifically directed <span id="page_2056"></span>the Agency to select the grievant for the next appropriate vacancy and to pay her at the higher rate beginning no later than 90 days from the date of the award. Thus, the Arbitrator ordered that the grievant be granted higher pay--front pay--without regard to whether she is appointed to a position classified at the higher pay rate or is performing duties justifying the higher rate.</p>

Therefore, an order requiring an agency to provide front pay must be supported by unambiguous statutory authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not cite statutory authority for his award of front pay, and no such authority is apparent. Such pay is not authorized by the Back Pay Act.

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Award Is Not Contrary To Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims the award is contrary to law.&#x2003;Therefore, we will review the questions of law raised in the Agency's exceptions and the Arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo. See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review, we will assess whether the Arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law and, in doing so, we will defer to the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). For the following reasons, we conclude that the award is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Award Does Not Violate the Agency's Right To Make Selections Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether an arbitrator's award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Upon finding that an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the law or contractual provision at issue<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 151-54.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an award requiring an agency to make a selection for an appointment affects management's right to make selections under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See Soc. Sec. Admin., Woodlawn, Md.</span>, 54 FLRA 1570, 1577 (1998) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Woodlawn</span>). Because the award in this case directs the Agency to promote the grievant to the next appropriate GS-14 position, we find that the award affects management's right to make selections under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Union's argument to the contrary, based on <span class="Italic">SSA, Chicago Region</span>, in which the Authority found that an arbitrator's review of an agency's application of its qualification standards did not affect management's right to make selections<span class="Italic">. See SSA, Chicago Region</span>, 56 FLRA at 1089. Here, there is no dispute that the grievant was qualified for the position, and the Arbitrator did not merely review the Agency's actions; he directed the Agency to promote the grievant. Therefore, based on <span class="Italic">SSA, Woodlawn</span>, we conclude that the award of a retroactive promotion to the grievant affects the Agency's right to make selections under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>test, the Agency concedes, consistent with well established Authority precedent, that the award satisfies prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Branch Office, E. Liverpool, Ohio</span>, 54 FLRA 142, 147-48 (1998) (contract provisions affording priority consideration rights are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute). With respect to prong II, the Authority has held that a remedy of a retroactive promotion properly reconstructs the agency's actions when the arbitrator finds that the agency would have selected the grievant, but for its violation of the parties' agreement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Serv. Network 13</span>, 56 FLRA 647, 650 (2000). Here, the Arbitrator explicitly found that the grievant would have been selected for the position "but for" the Agency's violations of the settlement and collective bargaining agreements. Therefore, we conclude that the award satisfies prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's insistence that the grievant would not have been selected for the position because he was not the "best qualified applicant" is not persuasive. The Arbitrator construed "priority consideration" as requiring the Agency to consider the grievant "<span class="Italic">before, and without reference to </span>[the] other candidates" and there is no dispute that this was not done. Moreover, the Arbitrator found that the Agency was required to select the grievant, unless "there were legitimate, job-related[ ] reasons" not to select him. The Agency does not dispute the Arbitrator's construction of the grievant's priority consideration rights, which also comports with Authority precedent<span class="Italic">. See SSA, Chicago Region, </span>56 FLRA at 1086. Indeed, the Agency makes no claim that it would not have selected the grievant had it considered him alone and before others. As the Arbitrator's conclusion that there were no legitimate, job-related reasons for the grievant's non-selection is undisputed, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award reconstructs what the Agency would have done had it not violated the parties' settlement and collective bargaining agreements. Consequently, we conclude that the award satisfies prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>test.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Award Does Not Violate the Back Pay Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held that an award of backpay under the Back Pay Act is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Health and Human Serv.</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998). The Agency argues that the Arbitrator did not find that its violations of the parties' agreements constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's precedent, an agency's breach of both a settlement agreement and a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def., Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 711, 719 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Distrib. Region E., New Cumberland, Pa., </span>50 FLRA 282, 283 (1995))<span class="Italic">; see also GSA, </span>55 FLRA 493, 496 (1999). Here, the Arbitrator expressly found that the Agency's failure to select the grievant constituted an "unjustified personnel action [that] resulted in the reduction of pay[.]" Therefore, the award satisfies the requirements of the Back Pay Act, and we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Arbitrator Did Not Exceed Her Authority</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Local 1617, </span>51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). Under longstanding Authority precedent, arbitrators have great latitude in fashioning remedies<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev., L.A. Area Office, Region IX, L.A., Cal., </span>35 FLRA 1224, 1229 (1990). Nevertheless, arbitrators exceed their authority by issuing an affirmative order that exceeds the scope of the matter submitted to arbitration<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., St. Albans, N.Y.,</span> 37 FLRA 1092, 1095 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by directing the Agency to promote the grievant to a position in OSHA <span id="page_2057"></span>or MSHA because "MSHA was the only agency involved in this matter." However, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator disregarded any specific limitations on her authority. Even though the disputed position was in MSHA, the record shows that the grievant worked for OSHA at the time of the grievance and that both activities are part of the Department of Labor. As the grievance was filed against the Department of Labor, and not a specific activity within the Department of Labor, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator disregarded any specific limitations on her authority<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1546, </span>52 FLRA 94, 98 (1996) (denying exception claiming arbitrator exceeded his authority by violating provision of parties' agreement governing arbitrator's authority);<span class="Italic"> cf. United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Training Ctr., Orlando, Fla., </span>53 FLRA 103, 108 (1997) (arbitrator did not exceed his authority where his remedy was not unlawful). Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">A violation of the grievant's right to priority consideration may require placement of the grievant into a position, and possibly displacement of another employee, but a backpay award may still be unjustified if the arbitrator cannot conclude the level of advancement that the grievant would have achieved with earlier placement into the position, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Ctr. for Medicare and Medicaid Serv. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 60 FLRA 437, 440-43 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The award does not excessively interfere with management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award violates its right to select.&#x2003;When resolving an exception alleging that an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If it does, then the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.<span class="Italic"> BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152-53.</p>

Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority considers whether the contract provision, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, constitutes either an appropriate arrangement or a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">See id.</span>;<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr, Oklahoma City, Okla.</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 110 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Oklahoma</span> <span class="Italic">City</span>). In this case, the Agency argues that Article 26, Section 14 of the agreement, as interpreted and applied, excessively interferes with its right to select and therefore is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When deciding if a provision is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority will first determine if the provision constitutes an arrangement because it is intended to be a remedy for employees adversely affected by management exercising its rights. <span class="Italic">Oklahoma City</span>, 58 FLRA at 110; <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Admin., Wash., D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 1233, 1236-37 (2000). If the provision is found to be an arrangement, the Authority will determine whether the provision excessively interferes with management's exercise of its right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 111.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency only argues that the award excessively interferes with its right to select. Where an award requiring the selection of a grievant with priority consideration is challenged, the Authority has consistently held that "contractual provisions affording such consideration constitute appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown, Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 917, 921 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Naval Weapons Station</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">SSA Chicago Region</span>, 56 FLRA at 1090; <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin., Branch Office, East Liverpool, Ohio</span>, 54 FLRA 142, 147-48 (1998) (<span class="Italic">SSA East Liverpool</span>)). Therefore, Article 26, Section 14 of the parties' agreement constitutes an appropriate arrangement and satisfies prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154. The Authority has held that a remedy of a retroactive promotion "properly reconstructs the agency's actions when the arbitrator finds that the agency would have selected the grievant, but for [the] violation of the parties' agreement." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 560, 562 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Serv. Network 13</span>, 56 FLRA 647, 650 (2000)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator construed "priority consideration" as requiring the Agency to select the grievant if she met the minimum qualifications. Based on his interpretation and findings of facts, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant was minimally qualified and "entitled to be selected" and that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not selecting her. Therefore, we find that the award satisfies prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA at 562-63 (citing<span class="Italic"> SSA, Chicago Region</span>, 56 FLRA at 1086). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 511 (2003) (Authority found an award, directing the agency to make the grievant whole, was a proper reconstruction where the arbitrator found the grievant met the minimum qualifications for a position and should have been selected); <span class="Italic">SSA East Liverpool</span>, 54 FLRA 142 (Authority found an award ordering the Agency to select the grievant for the next vacancy satisfied prong II where the arbitrator found that the agency violated the agreement by not selecting the grievant whom the agency failed to prove did not meet minimum qualifications). <span class="Italic">Cf. Family Support Admin</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>42 FLRA at 359 (The arbitrator's findings only established that the selection process violated the parties' agreement and did not, implicitly or explicitly, support a conclusion that the grievant would have been selected if the violations had not occurred.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the award is an appropriate arrangement and constitutes a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement, we find there is no basis to conclude the award is deficient as contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute because both prongs of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> are satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The award is inconsistent with the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we stated earlier, the Authority reviews questions of law raised by exceptions to an arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA at 332. In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. In making that determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;The Authority has long held that under the Back Pay Act, an award of back pay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials.<span class="Italic"> See United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DHHS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first requirement, a breach of the parties' agreement constitutes an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 55 FLRA 493, 496 (1999). Based on the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency breached the parties' agreement by not giving the grievant priority consideration, the first requirement under the Back Pay Act is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the second requirement of the Back Pay Act, an arbitrator must find that the unwarranted and unjustified personnel action resulted in a loss of pay, allowance or differential. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 54 FLRA at 1218-19. In this case, the Arbitrator acknowledged that not everyone in a career ladder position will reach the top of the ladder and stated, "one who performs their job properly, but is not motivated to seek promotion, is not committing an offense warranting discipline or termination." In addition, the Arbitrator conceded that he could not determine whether the grievant would have progressed beyond the GS-7 level. Finally, the Arbitrator, when awarding the back pay, stated, "<span class="Italic">[i]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">f</span> [g]rievant is found qualified[,]" illustrating the possibility that the grievant may not be qualified for the promotion or receive the promotion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the above, the Arbitrator awarded back pay based on the possibility that the grievant may receive a promotion in the future, not on a finding that the Agency's actions actually caused the grievant to suffer a loss in pay, allowances or differentials. Accordingly, as the Arbitrator never made a finding, implicitly or explicitly, that, but for the Agency's failure to follow the agreement, the grievant suffered a loss of pay, allowances or differentials, the award does not satisfy the second requirement of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 147</span>, 59 FLRA 864, 866 (2004) (Member Pope dissenting) and citations therein (Authority found the required causal connection was not implicit from the arbitrator's award and stated that a finding of a violation of the parties' agreement does not establish a causal connection justifying back pay); <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin., Office of Hearings and Appeals, Orlando, Fla.</span>, 54 FLRA 609, 614 (1998) (Authority set aside award of back pay because it did not reflect any connection between the failure to follow promotion procedures and the failure of the grievant to be selected for promotion). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Cleveland Regional Office, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 59 FLRA 248, 251 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting as to other matters) (Authority found that in the absence of an "explicit or implicit" finding by an arbitrator that "but <span id="page_2058"></span>for" the agency's actions the grievant "would have been" promoted there is no causal connection established under the Back Pay Act.) <span class="Italic">Cf. SSA Chicago Region</span>, 56 FLRA at 1090 (Authority determined back pay was justified because the arbitrator implicitly found that the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action led to the grievant's loss of pay.) Based on the above, we find deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act the part of the award ordering back pay contingent on the grievant's promotion to the GS-9 level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The award draws its essence from the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for an award to be found deficient as failing to draw its essence from the agreement, it must be established that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Distribution Ctr., New Cumberland, Pa., </span>55 FLRA 1303, 1306-07 (2000) (Member Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor (OSHA), </span>34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990)<span class="Italic"> </span>(<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>).<span class="Italic"> </span>The Authority applies the deferential "essence" standard to review the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' settlement agreement because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained. <span class="Italic">See Naval Weapons Station, </span>57 FLRA at 920;<span class="Italic"> OSHA, </span>34 FLRA at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' agreement states that if there is a previous failure to properly consider an employee for a position, the Agency will grant the employee priority consideration, defined as <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration, for other positions. The Arbitrator interpreted priority consideration under the parties' agreement as requiring the Agency to select an employee for the position if the employee meets the minimum qualifications. Based on this interpretation, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not selecting the grievant (who met the minimum qualifications for the position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's award is implausible, irrational or in manifest disregard of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA East Liverpool, </span>54 FLRA at 146-47 (Authority found that the award did not fail to draw its essence from the parties' agreement where the arbitrator, interpreting priority consideration as requiring the agency to select an employee who meets the minimum qualifications, found that the agency violated the agreement when it did not select the grievant.) <span class="Italic">See also Naval Weapons Station, </span>57 FLRA at 920 (Authority found an award where the arbitrator determined the agency had not granted priority consideration and ordered the agency to select a grievant for the next vacancy did not fail to draw its essence from the agreement) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 4044, </span>57 FLRA at 101-102). Thus, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;The award is not ambiguous or impossible to implement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For an award to be found deficient as incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory, the appealing party must show that implementation of the award is impossible because the meaning and effect of the award are too unclear or uncertain. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1843, </span>51 FLRA 444, 448 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues it is unclear whether the position in which it must place the grievant must have the same promotion potential as the original position.&#x2003;In his clarification, the Arbitrator stated that the intent of his award was clear on page 11 where he discussed the grievant's potential future promotions. As the Arbitrator discussed the possible future promotions, consistent with the promotion potential in the original position, the record supports a conclusion that the award requires the Agency to place the grievant in a Health Insurance Specialist GS-7 position with the same promotion potential as the original position. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care Sys., Biloxi, Miss., </span>57 FLRA 77, 79 (2001)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency argues that it does not know how to implement the award, but concedes that the award places it in the "untenable position of having to either remove the candidate who was ultimately selected for the position through the competitive process or of having to create another position into which to place the [g]rievant, whether or not the Agency had created such a new position." The Agency has demonstrated that it knows its choices in implementing the award, thereby negating its claim that the award is impossible to implement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the above, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award is so ambiguous as to make implementation impossible.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Hq., IRS and NTEU Chap. 65</span>, 49 FLRA 1430, 1439-40 (1994). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA Mid-Atl. Region and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 53 FLRA 956, 965 (1997) (sustaining back pay award by arbitrator who decided that improper denial of priority consideration resulted in grievant's nonselection for promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent">The priority consideration article considered in <span class="Italic">SSA, Kansas City</span> was again found valid in <span class="Italic">SSA, Mid-Atl. Program Serv. Ctr. and AFGE Local 2006</span>, 50 FLRA 578 (1995). Article 26, Section 8 of the contract, quoted at 50 FLRA at 579 n.2, defined priority consideration as:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration for non-competitive selection given to an employee on account of previous failure to properly consider the employee for selection because of procedural, regulatory, or program violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the 1995 <span class="Italic">SSA</span> decision, 50 FLRA at 581-82:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitration awards interpreting and applying Article 26, Section 8 of the parties' agreement have been reviewed by the Authority in two previous cases. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Kansas City, Missouri, and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1336</span>, 37 FLRA 816, 817 (1990) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City</span>), an arbitrator held that the provision did not entitle a priority consideration candidate to "automatic selection." Nevertheless, the arbitrator interpreted the provision as requiring the agency to select priority consideration candidates who met minimum qualifications for a position, and the arbitrator found that but for the agency's violation of the parties' agreement the grievant would have been selected for promotion. Applying <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), the Authority denied the agency's exception that the award, which ordered the agency to promote the grievant in that case, violated its right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, San Juan, Puerto Rico and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2608</span>, 46 FLRA 1134, 1142 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA, San Juan</span>), a different arbitrator interpreted the same contract provision "as simply a procedure that defined the process by which the [a]gency would extend priority consideration." In particular, the arbitrator stated that the focus of his examination of the provision was "the process by which the [a]gency considered the grievant's application for promotion, rather than the 'substance or merits of the consideration.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1137 (citation omitted). Consistent with the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision, the Authority concluded that <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> did not apply and that the award, ordering the agency to promote the grievant in that case, was deficient because it conflicted with the agency's right to select under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator in the case now before us held that Article 26, Section 8 did not require "automatic" promotion. However, the Arbitrator interpreted the provision as requiring "a real, genuine effort (on the part of the Agency) not to exclude the employee from a vacancy for which the employee is minimally qualified." According to the Arbitrator, the provision places a burden on the Agency "to try to select the employee exercising his/her priority consideration for the vacant position." Reading the award as a whole, we conclude that it is not based on an interpretation of Article 26, Section 8 as constituting a procedure and, instead, is more like the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision in <span class="Italic">SSA, Kansas City</span>. As such, noting that, based on the Arbitrator's interpretation of the provision, which has not been shown deficient, Article 26, Section 8, applies only to employees who were not given proper consideration for selection, under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, and consistent with <span class="Italic">SSA, Kansas City</span>, the award is not deficient as contrary to the Agency's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">When management failed properly to consider the grievant for a position through priority consideration, an arbitrator directed promotion and back pay, and that award was sustained, <span class="Italic">SSA Chicago Region and AFGE Local 3348</span>, 56 FLRA 1084, 1089-90 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated, as a general principle, that awards based on an arbitrator's differing assessment of employee qualifications affect management's rights<span class="Italic">. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, </span>32 FLRA at 536 ("[i]f management has made determinations concerning the qualifications needed for an assignment or the qualifications of employees to be assigned, an arbitrator cannot reject those determinations and apply his or her independent determinations concerning qualifications")<span class="Italic">. See also United States Naval Ordnance Station,</span> 23 FLRA 671, 673 (1986); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Base, </span>23 FLRA at 370-71; <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Laredo,</span> 17 FLRA at 69. However, in certain limited circumstances, the Authority has upheld awards against management rights exceptions where arbitrators assessed whether an agency properly processed the evidence in the record, for example, whether the agency has ignored contrary evidence, in applying its own qualification criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, under Authority precedent, arbitrators may not, consistent with management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106, simply disagree with an agency's assessment of employees' qualifications, but they are not bound by assessments that are based on a faulty use of the evidence in the record. Succinctly stated, an arbitrator's review of agency qualification determinations to assess whether the agency, in applying its qualifications standards, properly processed the evidence in the record <span id="page_2059"></span>does not affect managements rights in a manner that is contrary to the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Family Support Administration,</span> 42 FLRA at 352; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury,</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Dallas, Tex., </span>37 FLRA 1022, 1028 (1990). <span class="Italic">See also NTEU, Chapter 137</span>, 34 FLRA 650, 656 (1990) (agency provided no support for claim that some employees more qualified than others so as to demonstrate that arbitrator erred in finding employees equally qualified).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is precisely the manner in which the Arbitrator in this case reviewed the Agency's claims as to the grievant's qualifications. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the selecting officials' testimony as to her reasons for rejecting the grievant was based on hearsay and did not take into account the evidence as to the grievant's performance and qualifications. In effect, he found that the Agency failed to properly consider and weigh all the evidence in the record. He also found that the credibility of the selecting official's evaluation of the grievant's qualifications was compromised by that official's managerial failure to observe or address the alleged areas of deficiency in the grievant's performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Arbitrator found, applying the qualifications appropriately established by the selecting official, that the selecting official's faulty use of the evidence undermined that official's determination that the grievant was unqualified. Such review, under Authority precedent, does not affect management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute and, thus, it is unnecessary to apply the test set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP. </span>Consequently, we reject the Agency's arguments based on its claim that the grievant was unqualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority has consistently held, insofar as exceptions challenging awards requiring the selection of grievants with priority consideration are concerned, that contractual provisions affording such consideration constitute appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social Security Admin., Branch</span> <span class="Italic">Office, East Liverpool, Oh., </span>54 FLRA 142, 147-48 (1998) <span class="Italic">(SSA, East Liverpool); United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Serv., Social Security Admin., Kansas City, Mo., </span>37 FLRA 816, 822-23 (1990). In rejecting the Agency's argument that priority consideration was too great a benefit for a procedural error such as leaving the grievant off the BQ list, the Arbitrator clearly demonstrated that he considered Article 26, Section 13 to be an appropriate arrangement. To the extent that the Agency's exceptions challenge the Arbitrator's award requiring that the grievant be selected for the next appropriate vacancy on the ground that the award affects management's right to select by dictating a selection, consistent with Authority precedent, the award satisfies both prongs of <span class="Italic">BEP. See SSA, East Liverpool, </span>54 FLRA at 148.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Back Pay Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator ordered that the grievant be made whole "to the extent allowed by law" and "subject to" the Back Pay Act. Specifically, he ordered that the grievant be promoted to the next appropriate vacancy, and paid the "difference between her salary and what she would have earned as a Claims Representative beginning on the date the person selected from the BQ List entered the job at issue and ending when [the g]rievant enters the appropriate vacancy." Because he ordered that the specified make whole relief be consistent with the Back Pay Act, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award required that the grievant's promotion, when effectuated, be retroactive to that date. Construed in this manner, the award is not contrary to law<span class="Italic">. See SSA, Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center,</span> 53 FLRA 956, 965-66 (1997). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 3</span>, 60 FLRA 742, 745 (2005), determined that an arbitrator properly authorized back pay to compensate for an agency's failure to provide proper priority consideration for a position, without specific reference to the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized where an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218 (1998). The Authority has found that awards ordering retroactive promotions with backpay satisfy the requirements of the Back Pay Act where an arbitrator finds that the grievant would have been promoted but for the agency's violation of the grievant's priority consideration rights under a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOL</span>, 59 FLRA at 563. Because the Arbitrator expressly found that "but for" the Agency's violation of Article 13, &#x00A7; 11 of the parties' agreement, the grievant "would have been promoted[,]" we find that the award satisfies the two prongs of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claim to the contrary is based on the Arbitrator's order that the Agency "begin paying [the g]rievant at the appropriate GS-14 level...." In this connection, the Agency interprets the award as requiring payment to the grievant before he is promoted to the GS-14 position. However, the Agency's interpretation ignores the Arbitrator's specific statement of intention to "follow established precedent" in fashioning a remedy. In this regard, the award is similar to the award in <span class="Italic">SSA, Chicago Region, Cleveland Ohio Dist. Office, University Circle Branch</span>, 56 FLRA 1084, 1090 (2001) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Chicago Region</span>), where an arbitrator awarded backpay "beginning on the date the person selected...entered the job...and ending when [the g]rievant enters the appropriate vacancy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There, because the arbitrator ordered that the grievant be made whole "to the extent allowed by law" and "subject to" the Back Pay Act, the Authority interpreted the award, consistent with the Back Pay Act, as requiring payment to the grievant only after the promotion was effectuated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator in this case did not specifically refer to the Back Pay Act, there is no question that, pursuant to the "established precedent" acknowledged by the Arbitrator, the Back Pay Act is the applicable law that governs the award. Therefore, consistent with the Arbitrator's specific intent, we interpret the award as entitling the grievant to backpay only after the promotion is effectuated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. 56 FLRA at 1090 (citing <span class="Italic">SSA, Mid-Atlantic Program Serv. Ctr.</span>, 53 FLRA 956, 965-66 (1997)); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Health and Human Serv., Soc. Sec. Admin., Kansas City, Mo</span>., 37 FLRA 816, 825-26 (1990) (construing award of backpay consistent with the Back Pay Act). So interpreted, we find that the award does not violate the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of this conclusion, we necessarily reject the Agency's argument based on <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>. In that decision, the Court held that the Back Pay Act authorizes "retroactive recovery of wages" and that a federal employee is "entitled to receive only the salary of the position to which he was appointed...." 424 U.S. at 405-06. However, as construed above, the award does not require the grievant to be paid for a position that he does not occupy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Serv. Employees Int'l Union, Local 200,</span> 10 FLRA 49 (1982) (retroactive promotion with backpay not authorized under <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan </span>for period before position was actually classified). Rather, the award requires retroactive backpay when the promotion is effectuated, consistent with the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator directed promotion when he concluded that a contract priority consideration procedure was violated after the agency compared the qualifications of the grievant with other applicants for the position. The arbitrator directed promotion after determining that the grievant met the essential requirements of the contract: that he have a right to priority consideration and that, according to the intent of the article, he be selected if he met the basic requirements for the position. FLRA denied exceptions to the award, concluding that the arbitrator enforced the contract article as an appropriate arrangement, but FLRA modified the award to delete the requirement that the grievant be promoted without regard to the existence of a vacancy. FLRA modified the award to call for promotion upon the next vacancy, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Kansas City and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 37 FLRA 816, 822-26 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It is clear that Article 26, Section 8 constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's right to select. Furthermore, the provision as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator only requires management to select an employee exercising a priority consideration when management determines that the application meets the minimum standards that management has set for adequate performance of the job. Although this interpretation limits management from selecting from any appropriate source in those instances where a qualified employee exercises priority consideration, this interpretation preserves management's right to determine the "minimum standard...for adequate performance of the job" and provides "no requirement that an unqualified employee be promoted under a priority consideration."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception presents an issue of first impression before the Authority of whether an award of a prospective promotion, without regard to whether an appropriate vacant position exists, is contrary to section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In terms of the Arbitrator's remedy in this case, we find that an arbitration award that orders an employee prospectively promoted without regard to whether an appropriate vacant position exists interferes with management's right under section 7106(b)(1) to determine the numbers of employees or positions assigned to an organizational subdivision. In our view, such an award encompasses the situation where, in order to comply with the award, the agency must establish an appropriate position to which the grievant can be promoted. Consequently, unless the arbitrator is merely enforcing an applicable agreement of the parties, the consistency of such an award with management's right to determine its staffing patterns cannot be conclusively confirmed when the arbitrator renders the award.... [W]e will find that such an award is deficient unless the award merely enforces an applicable agreement of the parties on such matter. On finding the award deficient, we will modify the award to preserve both management's right to determine its staffing patterns and the essence of the arbitrator's relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To preserve management's right, we will substitute the remedy that the grievant be promoted to the next available appropriate vacancy. To maintain the essence of the arbitrator's relief, we will also direct that <span id="page_2060"></span>the grievant receive backpay, if appropriate. Backpay will be appropriate when the agency fills an appropriate vacancy with a person other than the grievant between the date of the arbitrator's award and the date of the Authority's decision modifying the award as stated above. This approach will permit the agency to file exceptions to the award and to fill vacancies during the pendency of the exceptions before the Authority without fear of committing an unfair labor practice by failing to comply with the arbitrator's award. At the same time, this remedy establishes that the date the agency fills a position appropriate for the grievant will be the benchmark for backpay relief to the grievant under the modified award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, such a finding of deficiency and modification of an award can be avoided if arbitrators limit awards of prospective promotions to the next available appropriate vacancy.... In this respect, we note that section 7106(b)(1) applies only to awards of prospective promotions. Nothing in section 7106(b)(1) or this decision applies to awards of retroactive promotions with backpay. Arbitrators remain authorized to award retroactive promotions when they have made the required findings, which findings are unaffected by this decision.</p>
