<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-196"><span class="space">e.</span> Disclosure After the Personnel Action; Action Contemplated and in Preparation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblowing reprisal requires a protected disclosure that results in retaliation. If the protected disclosure follows rather than precedes the alleged reprisal, no IRA case is established, although the causal connection is a merits rather than a jurisdictional determination, according to <span class="Italic">Finston v. HCFA</span>, 83 MSPR 100, 102 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (still dismissing the appeal because no reprisal was alleged in the complaint to OSC):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) that requires an agency official to change a decision once he or she learns that a person has engaged in whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 296, 303 (1993). Consequently, if an agency takes an action before the appellant makes a disclosure, the Board may find that the disclosure was not a contributing factor in the action<span class="Italic">. See O'Shea v. Department of Transportation</span>, 65 MSPR 512, 515 (1994); <span class="Italic">Washington v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 49 MSPR 632, 638 (1991). The administrative judge's finding that the agency could not have retaliated against the appellant because the disclosure to OSC was made after the job announcement closed is therefore a finding on contributing factor, that is, she concluded that the alleged protected disclosure could not have been a contributing factor in the agency's action based on the timing of the disclosure and the alleged personnel action. The administrative judge therefore dismissed the appeal as outside the Board's jurisdiction based on a merits finding. In this regard, she erred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ahmad v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/AHMAD_NAEEM_CH_1221_12_0462_W_2_FINAL_ORDER_1969382.pdf">CH-1221-12-0462-W-2</a> (NP 10/17/2022) ("Nothing in the whistleblower protection statutes prohibits an agency from taking an action against an employee about whom it has performance and/or conduct concerns prior to any agency official's awareness of the employee's whistleblowing disclosures.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of post-proposal disclosures, under <span class="Italic">Durr v. VA,</span> 104 MSPR 509, 513-14 &#x00B6; 10, 2007 MSPB 19 (2007) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Durr v. MSPB</span>, 297 Fed. Appx. 966 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), further remand for readjudication by AJ, <span class="Italic">Durr v. VA</span>, 119 MSPR 195, 2013 MSPB 12 (2013)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, to establish Board jurisdiction the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in protected whistleblowing activity that was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371. The action at issue in this case is the agency's July 25, 2003 proposed admonishment for alleged misconduct. The appellant wrote his September 10, 2003 letter to OSC after the agency issued this proposal. As a matter of law, the subsequent protected disclosure could not have contributed to the proposed admonishment. <span class="Italic">See Washington v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 632, 638 (1991), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Therefore, we find that the appellant did not set forth enough detail in his disclosures until after the agency proposed to discipline him. As a consequence, he has not made a nonfrivolous <span id="Page_3971"></span>allegation that he made a protected disclosure that contributed to the agency's proposed action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">El v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found the proposal to remove Ms. Jones was underway weeks before she signed the petition. Therefore, even if the petition constituted a protected disclosure, it could not have been a contributing factor. The administrative judge found Ms. Jones "did not sign the petition until December 20, 2009." Further, the administrative judge credited Ms. Goughler's testimony that she decided on November 16, 2009 to propose Ms. Jones' removal. The record also shows Ms. Goughler regularly expressed concern with Ms. Jones' job performance and worked with her "for well over one year to improve her performance deficiencies" before proposing her removal. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, this court finds substantial evidence to support the administrative judge's determination that the USPS decided to propose Ms. Jones' removal from her position as Lead MDO well before she signed the petition.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 MSPR 595, 604-05 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the question was whether a decision to reassign an employee was in reprisal for his disclosures to the agency IG. The evidence showed that, up until the time the reassignment decision was made, the respondent manager did not know of the IG contacts. After the decision was made, the manager learned of the contacts and did not change his mind concerning the reassignment. OSC argued that the manager was responsible for reprisal by reconfirming a decision to reassign the employee after the manager learned of the protected contacts between the employee and the IG. The Board disagreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Recommended Decision, the CALJ found that Hathaway had no knowledge of Livengood's disclosures at the time the initial decision to reassign Livengood was made. However, the CALJ found that Livengood's protected activity was a contributing factor in the threatened personnel action because the reassignment decision was reaffirmed after respondent learned of the protected activity.... The Board disagrees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CALJ's contributing factor analysis relied heavily on respondent's quick decision to meet with the IG, his behavior during that meeting and the IG's testimony regarding respondent's personality. While the Board agrees with the CALJ's findings regarding respondent's conduct at the meeting with IG Richard Herr, neither the strong words used nor intense emotion displayed is sufficient, under the circumstances, to show that Livengood's protected activity was a contributing factor in the decision to reassign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the record that indicates that Hathaway reassessed his threat to reassign Livengood once he learned of the disclosures. The quickness of Hathaway's decision to meet with the IG after he learned of the disclosures belies a finding that the reassignment threat was reassessed and reaffirmed. The CALJ apparently found that Hathaway had reaffirmed his decision because he "persisted" in it after he learned of the disclosures.... However, Hathaway's persistence does not, by itself, transform the previously threatened reassignment into a prohibited personnel practice. There is nothing in (b)(8) that requires a supervisor to change a decision once he learns that the employee has engaged in whistleblowing. Accordingly, the fact that Hathaway persisted in his plan to reassign Livengood after he learned of the disclosures to the IG does not constitute a violation of (b)(8). The Board finds, therefore, that the Special Counsel failed to prove that whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the threatened reassignment. Count one is not sustained.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the administrative judge identified two reasons for concluding that the appellant had not substantiated his claim of reprisal for making protected disclosures. First, he stated that the agency had shown that the appellant's removal "was contemplated and in preparation" before any agency official had become aware of the appellant's disclosures.... With respect to the first of these reasons, we note that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit indicated in <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. <span id="Page_3972"></span>denied</span>, 516 U.S. 1176 (1996), that disclosures made after an action was "initiated" cannot have been a contributing factor in the action. There is no indication in <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, however, that any decision regarding the employee's retention was made after the employee made his protected disclosures. Instead, it appears that the employee's supervisor made her decision to separate the employee prior to those disclosures, and that only the implementation of that decision followed the disclosures<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 281. We see nothing in <span class="Italic">Horton</span> or any other authority that indicates that an action that was only "contemplated and in preparation" before disclosures were made, or before officials taking the action became aware of them, cannot constitute reprisal for those disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fickie</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Mohler v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/MOHLER_TIMOTHY_CH_1221_18_0119_W_2_REMAND_ORDER_1943100.pdf">CH-1221-18-0119-W-2</a> (NP 7/18/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While disclosures made after an action has been finalized, even if it is not yet implemented, cannot be a contributing factor in the action, an action that was only "contemplated and in preparation" prior to a disclosure can serve as the predicate personnel action in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Fickie v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). Here, the record reflects that the Director of USBP Detroit Sector Headquarters determined that it was no longer tolerable for the appellant to use their facilities and that he needed to be relocated to another facility at least 1 day prior to his August 13, 2015 disclosure. However, there is no evidence that his relocation was finalized until <span class="Italic">after</span> he made the disclosure; rather, there is no evidence that his relocation was finalized until August 19, 2015, when the appellant's second-level supervisor issued him a letter stating that he would be temporarily reassigned to the Walled Lake Field Support Office effective immediately. Thus, the appellant may still establish contributing factor in connection with his temporary relocation if he meets the applicable criteria, notwithstanding the fact that the relocation was contemplated and in preparation before he made his August 13, 2015 disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Fickie</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis similar to <span class="Italic">Fickie</span> was presented in <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> SF-1221-07-0607-W-2 (NP 6/11/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge failed to take his second protected disclosure into consideration. The appellant's second chronological disclosure was made in his response to the proposal to suspend him, in which the appellant asserted that the proposing official, Mr. Contatore, had made materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements in filing the Operational Deviation Report with Washington and, further, that the proposed suspension was based on that allegedly falsified report. In support of his assertion, the appellant quotes the following portion of the initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As for the second of the appellant's two disclosures, it is undisputed that the appellant made the allegation that Mr. Contatore had falsified the FAA Form 7210-3 after he received from Mr. Contatore the notice of proposed five-day suspension. The Board has held that[,]"as a matter of law," a disclosure made after a notice of proposed disciplinary action has been issued[ ] cannot be a contributing factor to the proposal to take the action. <span class="Italic">Durr v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 509, 513-14 (2007). Thus, Mr. Contatore's issuance of the proposal could not have been an act of reprisal for the appellant's subsequent allegation against Mr. Contatore.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the very next paragraph of the initial decision states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">However, it is also undisputed that Mr. Contatore made his decision to impose the proposed suspension after he received the appellant's response to the proposal, which included the appellant's allegation about falsification. Because Mr. Contatore became aware of this disclosure not long before making his decision to suspend the appellant, I am constrained to find that the knowledge/timing test has been met. Accordingly, I find that this protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the decision to suspend the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the administrative judge clearly did consider the appellant's second disclosure as a contributing factor to the agency's allegedly retaliatory suspension action and the appellant's claim to the contrary is without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Fourth Circuit followed a similar path in <span class="Italic">Mikhaylov v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20230315076">___F.4th___</a> (4th Cir. 2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute does not provide that a protected disclosure automatically becomes a contributing factor in every case where a personnel action is finalized shortly after protected disclosures come to light; a disclosure is a contributing factor only when the confluence of the official's knowledge and the timing of the action reasonably suggests a connection between the two. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). When disciplinary action is initiated fast on the heels of an employee making a protected disclosure, a reasonable person could easily conclude that the discipline was in retaliation for the disclosure. On those paradigmatic facts, the protected disclosure must be viewed as a contributing factor. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Kewley v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 153 F.3d 1357, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("If a whistleblower demonstrates both that the deciding official knew of the disclosure and that the removal action was initiated within a reasonable time of that disclosure, no further nexus need be shown, and no countervailing evidence may negate the petitioner's showing.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case, however, are very different from the paradigmatic whistleblower case. Here, the disciplinary process was initiated before Mikhaylov made the protected disclosures--the Agency began investigating after Jaspal made his complaint in July 2018, and Mikhaylov made his first protected disclosure in October 2018. To be sure, the Deciding Official did impose the two-day suspension shortly after he learned through the case file that Mikhaylov had made protected disclosures. The Deciding Official, however, came from an office outside of Mikhaylov's chain of command and was not connected in any way to the disclosures. Moreover, the Deciding Official testified that he did not consider the disclosures when determining the appropriate sanction, and he imposed a significantly less severe suspension than was recommended by the disciplinary panel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DOJ</span>, DC-1221-12-0544-B-1 (NP 9/21/2015) ("As explained above, we find there is insufficient evidence in the record that the deciding official had firmly decided to reassign the appellant prior to learning of his disclosure; rather, we find that the deciding official continued to weigh and evaluate whether he would reassign the appellant or take some other action after learning of the disclosure. Under these facts, where the decision to reassign the appellant had neither been initiated nor finalized prior to the deciding official learning of the disclosure, the decision to reassign the appellant is not exempted from review under <span class="Italic">Dean</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fickie</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9.").</p>
