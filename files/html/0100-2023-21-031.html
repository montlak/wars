<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-31"><span class="space">5.</span> Situational or Transitory Condition; Hostile Environment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not established clear guidelines separating situational difficulties causing psychological or physical problems sufficient to warrant the grant of a disability retirement application and those problems that are insufficient to demonstrate the required statutory level of disability. Earlier Board decisions tended to discount disabilities tied to workplace problems as "situational" and insufficient to warrant disability retirement. Later cases show more flexibility by the Board and a higher likelihood of the grant of disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To qualify for disability retirement, the underlying condition should not be temporary, it need not be shown to last a lifetime, but apparently recovery must not be foreseeable, <span class="Italic">Bryant v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 367, 368-69 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A disabling condition need not be shown to be permanent in order for a federal employee to be eligible for disability retirement. The Board agrees that disability retirement would not be granted in a case where clearly the illness is temporary. However, disability retirement might be granted in a situation, where though the disability cannot be predicted to last a lifetime, recovery from the disability also is not forseeable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A condition that is likely no more than temporary and may be amendable to treatment would not likely qualify for an annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chase v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 550, 552 (1982) ("Nevertheless, he further explained that the calculus was of such a size that it could spontaneously pass and that treatment by medication might very well prove efficacious. Thus there is an insufficient basis for a finding that the performance of his duties is incompatible with his medical condition. <span class="Italic">Compare Sullivan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 636 [7 MSPR 25] (1981).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board disapproved annuity applications based on its assessment that the conditions leading to the applications were situational or transitory. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 249, 256 &#x00B6; 16, 2008 MSPB 240 (2008) ("The appellant's testimony reveals that her condition may be largely situational. She testified that her stressful working environment was directly related to her supervisor, that she was in a harassing work situation, felt that she was targeted, and 'was always being hunted down and getting written up constantly.' The limited medical evidence available in the record suggests that the appellant is better when she is not at work. The Board has held that an appellant must show that she is unable to perform her job duties in general and not only in the context of what she sees as a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">Guthrie v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 12 (2007); <span class="Italic">Tan-Gatue v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 15 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 52 F. App'x 511 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellant's contention that the DVA should have assigned her to work for a different supervisor, tends to suggest that she believes she would be able to perform the duties of her position in a less stressful environment. <span class="Italic">See Guthrie,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 12."); <span class="Italic">Cosby v. OPM,</span> 106 MSPR 487, 492-93 &#x00B6; 9, 2007 MSPB 217 (2007) (stress-related disability retirement denied when the appellant's evidence did not show an inability to perform essential functions of his position in general, but instead indicated that he could not perform them in what he perceived as a hostile environment; the medical evidence showed the disability was situational; citing <span class="Italic">Musser v. OPM,</span> 102 MSPR 18, 22-23 &#x00B6; 10, 2006 MSPB 102 (2006)); <span class="Italic">Musser v. OPM,</span> 102 MSPR 18, 22 &#x00B6; 10, 2006 MSPB 102 (2006) (Member Sapin dissenting) ("The appellant also testified that anxiety and stress caused by her increased workload and alleged under-staffing by the agency caused her to become absent from work. However, it is well settled that an appellant must show that she is unable to perform her job duties in general and not just that she is unable to perform them in the context of what she perceives as a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tan-Gatue v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 15 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 52 F. App'x 511 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Thus, this case does not fall within the narrow <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception because the evidence does not unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant's medical condition prevents her from performing her specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Anderson,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 17-18, 20."; (<span class="Italic">Bynum</span> requirement of "unambiguously and without contradiction" overruled in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HENDERSON_CLARISA_HICKS_DC_831E_10_0812_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_686198.pdf">117 MSPR 313</a>, 319-23 &#x00B6; 11-20, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a nonprecedential decision, the Board said of a hostile work environment claim related to a retirement application, <span class="Italic">Brewer v. OPM</span>, PH-844E-11-0087-I-1 (NP 10/27/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, it is fair to say that the appellant's medical records showed that she attributed her anxiety and panic attacks to excess work and a "hostile work environment," and that she felt better when she was no longer going to work. The Board has held that job-related stress resulting in physical or mental conditions that prevent an employee from performing the duties required in her position can warrant the granting of disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Yoshimoto v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 86, &#x00B6; 18 (2008). However, one is not entitled to a disability retirement annuity where a medical condition is based on a single work environment, e.g., because it grew out of a personal conflict with a supervisor, <span class="Italic">see Cosby v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10 (2007), or resulted from a perceived hostile work environment due to workload or understaffing, <span class="Italic">see Musser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). <span class="Italic">Confer,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 16. The Board has held that an appellant must show that she is unable to perform her job duties in general and not only in the context of what she sees as a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">Guthrie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 12 (2007); <span class="Italic">Tan-Gatue v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 15 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 52 F. App'x. 511 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Here, there is no evidence showing that the appellant could not work as a Medical Support Assistant generally; rather, the evidence suggests that the workload and stress of the particular office in which she worked triggered her symptoms.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Marucci v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 442, 445-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-13 (2001), granted an annuity based on disability caused by sexual harassment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board cases addressing disability retirement eligibility based on mental disease or psychological illness have held that stress, anxiety, depression, and discomfort at work are not sufficient to show that an individual is unable to perform the specific duties of a position. <span class="Italic">See Klein v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 366, 372 (1996); <span class="Italic">Boss v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 234, 237 (1984). The Board has also stated, however, that job-related stress resulting in physical and mental ailments that prevent an employee from performing the duties necessary in her job can warrant granting a disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">See Marczewski v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6; 7 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in cases such as the present one, the disability determination often depends on whether the record contains a reasoned explanation of how the appellant's stress-related psychological condition disables the employee from performing specific job duties. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 16 (2000); <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 11 (1999); <span class="Italic">Tarlaian v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 247, 254 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 168 F.3d, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table). There may also be a case, however, where the employee's psychological impairment is so severe that "finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements" are not required. But the present case does not fall into this category. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 12 n.4 (2000); <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon considering the record as a whole, we conclude that the appellant has met her burden of proving her entitlement to the disability retirement annuity she seeks. In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with the administrative judge's analysis that, because sexual harassment and working conditions, rather than duties, created the appellant's mental problem, she was ineligible for disability retirement under <span class="Italic">Boss</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 237. Unlike Office of Workers' Compensation Programs claims, however, where an applicant must establish that an injury was work-related, the cause of the condition is not relevant in determining whether an employee is eligible for disability retirement. Instead, the relevant inquiry focuses on whether the condition prevents the employee from performing the duties necessary for the job. <span class="Italic">See Barbagallo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 557, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 11 (1999) (the appellant's disability claim was tied to harassment by co-workers' perceptions of the appellant's sexual orientation; the appellant was ineligible for disability retirement benefits because she failed to explain how her medical condition precluded her from performing her duties); <span class="Italic">Marczewski</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7 (the appellant claimed that he was unable to work because of severe emotional disturbance precipitated by his perception that his supervisor had mistreated him; the Board found that the work-related stress and anxiety that he suffered caused his mental condition that was, itself, incapacitating).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the appellant has presented sufficient evidence to establish that her mental condition prevented her from performing the duties of her position. After meeting with the appellant and conducting several clinical tests, Dr. Sean Evers, a psychologist, indicated in a December 15, 1998 psychological evaluation that the appellant had "significant anxiety" as well as an "underlying obsessive/compulsive personality pattern." While the record does not contain the actual results of these clinical tests, the record does not suggest that Dr. Sean Evers was unqualified to interpret the test results, and he diagnosed the appellant as suffering from anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. He also found that, based on the tests, his examination of the appellant, and his review of the appellant's clinical record and leave and earnings statements, that the events that caused the appellant to leave government employment "exacerbated a dormant underlying personality constellation that once triggered has served <span id="Page_4129"></span>to intensify her anxiety and literally make her unable to function in her previous job or at any job requiring significant responsibility or decision making." The appellant's position description and evaluation reports indicate that her GS-11 position of Provisioning Specialist requires her to exercise significant responsibility and decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's primary therapist, Dr. Anne Evers, prepared a January 24, 2000 psychological evaluation that related the appellant's symptoms to specific responsibilities of the appellant's position. Dr. Evers indicated that the appellant was severely depressed, that she had "developed a marked and pervasive anxiety disorder with panic attacks," and that these symptoms were further complicated by the appellant's "obsessive compulsive" personality structure. Dr. Evers described the appellant's job duties, that included the following: interfacing with contractors and supply personnel; communicating with the soldier in the field; attending planning meetings to help establish policy, administer training sessions, and interpret complex documents; and understanding high tech systems, assisting in disseminating that understanding to front-line military personnel, and assisting in employee computer training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Evers explained that the appellant's ability to understand complex documents was affected by the symptoms associated with her anxiety and depression, including "easy fatigueability, difficulty concentrating and diminished ability to think clearly." With respect to the appellant's ability to interact with co-workers, and peers, Dr. Evers noted that, when the appellant was faced with social situations, "she feels keyed up and on edge, extreme muscle tension, gastrointestinal distress, palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, and trembling." Again, the duties Dr. Evers delineated were generally consistent with the duties described by the appellant's position description and performance evaluations. We find that the above evidence provides "a reasoned explanation of how [the appellant's stress related] medical condition precluded the performance of...specific duties." <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see Rozar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 136, 139 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the record does not support the conclusion that the appellant's condition is being successfully treated with medication and weekly therapy. Instead, the medical evidence, and the appellant's testimony, indicate that her condition worsened over time, despite medication and therapy, that her condition changed from acute to chronic, and that her prognosis deteriorated from good, to guarded, and then to extremely guarded. More important, no evidence suggests that the appellant's treatment was successful in returning her to a point where she was able, even with some form of accommodation, to perform the duties of her position. We, therefore, conclude that the appellant has met her burden of proving by preponderant evidence her entitlement to the FERS disability retirement annuity that she seeks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee need not be permanently off the job to successfully demonstrate eligibility to a disability retirement. A severe allergic reaction to workplace contaminants may establish a basis for the annuity if there is continuing and exposure to the agent, fungus, that provokes the allergic reaction that then disables the employee and could potentially develop into chronic lung diseases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. OPM</span>, 7 MSPR 25, 26-27 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether a disability is situational, the Board may consider subsequent work history, <span class="Italic">Confer v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 419, 426 &#x00B6; 16, 2009 MSPB 102 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent work history is relevant to whether an individual's condition is confined to a single work environment. <span class="Italic">See Yoshimoto,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 86, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 14 (1999). Thus, one is not entitled to a disability retirement annuity where one's medical condition is based on a single work environment, e.g., because it grew out of a personal conflict with a supervisor, <span class="Italic">see Cosby v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10 (2007), or resulted from a perceived hostile work environment due to workload or understaffing, <span class="Italic">see Musser v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). This is not such a case. Moreover, the appellant's home health care position entailed very different responsibilities from her LPN job at the VAMC. Therefore, we find that the appellant's employment in home health care after her resignation does not undermine her testimony that she was unable to work in her LPN position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speculative assertions by OPM as to potential future improvement may be entitled to little weight, <span class="Italic">Adams v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 78, 82 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, it is apparent that, to some extent, OPM based its denial of disability on its finding that appellant's condition is amenable to treatment and control. This was error. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Diener v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 396, 398 (1981), such a finding is speculative in nature and:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]t is the present physical and mental state of the appellant which is at issue. This is especially true since OPM has the authority to require disability retirement annuitants to submit to annual physical examinations to determine whether they are still disabled. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(c).</p>
