<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-217"><span class="space">1.</span> Right to Representation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board's regulations specify that only an appellant, her designated representative, or a party properly substituted may file an appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a); <span class="italic">Goode v. Department of the Navy,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). This is consistent with the statutory language, which provides that '[a]n employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.' 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)." <span class="italic">Whetten-Hernandez v. VA</span>, DE-3443-16-0457-I-1 (NP 4/25/2023). "[T]he appellant's choice of representative is personal to him, and similarly, an agency may choose to be represented by an attorney or a non-attorney, at its discretion." <span class="Italic">Walton v. TVA</span>, 48 MSPR 462, 469 (1991). Disputes between an appellant and her representative as to the availability or quality of representational responsibility are addressed in other fora, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the Federal Labor Relations Authority if the appellant is asserting entitlement to union representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 82 MSPR 251, 253 n.* (1999). Because a representative need not be a union official, the failure of a representative to take an action is not excused by his failure to secure reelection as a local union official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McAllister v. Dept. of Army</span>, 11 MSPR 57, 59 (1982). Apparently, an attorney who is designated as counsel may not, upon her departure from a law firm, transfer responsibility for the case to the firm without a designation that includes the firm. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Towns v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 39 MSPR 399, 401 n.1 (1989) (considering a change in representative during the pendency of PFR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1200"></span>The right to representation--more accurately, the right to secure and utilize a representative in a Board case--is guaranteed by 5 USC 7701(a)(2). Under 5 CFR 1201.31 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedure</span>. A party to an appeal may be represented in any matter related to the appeal. Parties may designate a representative, revoke such a designation, and change such a designation in a signed submission, submitted as a pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A party may choose any representative as long as that person is willing and available to serve. The other party or parties may challenge the designation, however, on the ground that it involves a conflict of interest or a conflict of position. Any party who challenges the designation must do so by filing a motion with the judge within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of designation or 15 days after a party becomes aware of the conflict. The judge will rule on the motion before considering the merits of the appeal. These procedures apply equally to each designation of representative, regardless of whether the representative was the first one designated by a party or a subsequently designated representative. If a representative is disqualified, the judge will give the party whose representative was disqualified a reasonable time to obtain another one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The judge, on his or her own motion, may disqualify a party's representative on the grounds described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;As set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of &#x00A7; 1201.43 of this part, a judge may exclude a representative from all or any portion of the proceeding before him or her for contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Additional comments concerning the right to representation are in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at Chapter 2:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">REPRESENTATION</span>. The Board's regulations governing representation are set out at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31. A party to an appeal may be represented in any matter related to the appeal. The parties must designate their representatives in writing and also must inform the Board and all other parties of any subsequent changes in their representation in writing. If a party has more than one representative, generally only one of the representatives must be served with a copy of the appeal documents, but when documents are served electronically there is no need to limit service this way. (At a hearing, generally only one of the representatives will be allowed to question each witness. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 10, section 7b.) The AJ may reject submissions from represented appellants which are not sent by their designated representatives.</p>

The AJ may disqualify a representative for the same grounds on the AJ's own motion. A motion to challenge an opponent's representative must be filed within 15 days of the date of service of the notice of designation. The AJ must rule on the motion before considering the merits of the appeal, and if the AJ disqualifies a party's representative, the AJ must give that party a reasonable time to obtain another one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacks a process allowing for the general disqualification of representatives, but in an individual case, an AJ may exclude or limit the participation of a representative or other person for contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

Of the <span class="Italic">French</span> case, <span class="Italic">McCall v. SSA,</span> PH-0752-09-0658-I-1 (NP 11/19/2010), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the appellant claims that he is mentally incompetent and that he is entitled to representation at no cost. In <span class="Italic">French</span>, the Federal Circuit directed the Board to formulate procedures and set forth the standards for obtaining representation for incompetent disability retirement applicants. The Board has not held that the procedures directed in <span class="Italic">French</span> apply to cases outside of the retirement and retirement benefit context. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 269, &#x00B6; 6 (2000); <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 72, 75 (1990). Furthermore, the appellant's appeal form indicated that he did not wish to designate an individual or organization to represent him in the proceeding before the Board, and the appellant did not request that the administrative judge appoint him a representative. Moreover, because, as explained above, none of the evidence in the record establishes that the appellant was ever incompetent, the administrative judge's failure to inquire into the appellant's alleged mental incompetence was not error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. MSPB</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 970, 972-74 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), confirmed that the Board is not required to appoint counsel for an appellant who pleaded mental incapacity to handle her case and inability to secure <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Taylor therefore believes that the Board abused its discretion by failing to assign her federally-funded counsel who could assist her with developing her claim. We disagree. As an initial matter, Ms. Taylor has no constitutional right to appointed counsel to assist with her appeal of the Agency's removal action. That right is usually limited to criminal cases, and generally applies to civil cases such as this only when an indigent party's liberty is potentially threatened. <span class="Italic">Pitts v. Shinseki</span>, 700 F.3d 1279, 1283 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">see also Lassiter v. Dep't of Soc. Servs</span>., 452 U.S. 18, 26-27 (1981) ("[W]e...draw from [the Court's precedents] the presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty."); <span class="Italic">Arnesen v. Principi</span>, 300 F.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (generally there is no right to appointed counsel for indigent civil litigants absent a potential loss of personal freedom); <span class="Italic">Lariscey v. United States</span>, 861 F.2d 1267, 1270 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("[T]he right to counsel is highly circumscribed, and has been authorized in exceedingly restricted circumstances," such as when an indigent party "may lose his/her personal freedom if the action is lost").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and the Agency seldom encounter such cases, and so it is unsurprising that neither has any procedure in place for appointing federally-funded counsel to represent <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claimants. Nevertheless, on at least one prior occasion, we have directed the Board to provide some measure of assistance to a mentally incompetent <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claimant. In <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118 (Fed. Cir. 1987), we held that it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss as untimely a mentally incompetent man's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claim for disability retirement benefits, and we remanded with instructions that the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") should take an "active role" in helping Mr. French develop his claim. 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding that a mentally incompetent <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claimant should not "alone...be charged with the task of establishing his case" for disability benefits based upon mental incompetency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasoning and result of <span class="Italic">French</span> do not compel a remand of Ms. Taylor's case. We decided <span class="Italic">French</span> based largely upon our interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), which specifically concerns disability benefits. That statute permits the OPM to waive the 1 year statute of limitations for filing a claim seeking disability benefits if the claimant is mentally incapacitated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1201"></span>This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b); <span class="Italic">French</span>, 810 F.2d at 1119-20 (analyzing the statute's applicability to Mr. French's claim for disability benefits). We held that the OPM's refusal to hear Mr. French's untimely claim was inconsistent with this statutory mandate requiring "a high degree of care in dealing with the [disability]claims of the incompetent." <span class="Italic">French</span>, 810 F.2d at 1120.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rationale underpinning our <span class="Italic">French</span> decision is therefore generally inapplicable outside the retirement and disability benefit context, and to this end, the Board has declined to extend <span class="Italic">French</span> to removal actions. <span class="Italic">See Marbrey v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 72, 75 (1990) (declining to appoint counsel to assist former employee in challenging his removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even after <span class="Italic">French</span> was remanded, Mr. French was not appointed federally-funded counsel. Rather, the only relief that the Board offered to Mr. French was "a list of available attorneys...who might represent Mr. French <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> from sources such as the local bar association, the local Federal Executive Board, and other local organizations which provide legal services to the indigent." <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 37 M.S.P.R. 496, 499 n.3. (1988). Ms. Taylor has apparently already tried in vain to secure <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation from numerous lawyers and legal aid programs. It seems unlikely that she would achieve any better results following a remand, given that the Board could only refer her back to those same resources.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Taylor directs our attention to <span class="Italic">Fogg v. Dep't of Justice</span>, No. DC-0752-96-0101-I-2 (MSPB May 31, 1996) (Initial Decision), which is another case involving a former employee who alleged that his removal was reprisal for EEOC complaints that he had filed against his former employer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3. The Initial Decision in that case makes passing mention of the appellant's "newly court appointed counsel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11. Ms. Taylor argues that <span class="Italic">Fogg</span> thus refutes the Board's presently-claimed inability to appoint counsel in non-retirement cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reviewing the record, however, it does not appear that Mr. Fogg's counsel actually was appointed by the Board. Instead, Mr. Fogg's counsel was appointed by the District Court for the District of Columbia, in the context of his co-pending EEOC case. <span class="Italic">See</span> Order Directing Appointment of <span class="Italic">Pro Bono</span> Counsel, <span class="Italic">Fogg v. Gonzales,</span> 407 F. Supp.2d 79 (D.D.C. 2005) (No. 94-cv-2814) (appointing counsel for Mr. Fogg pursuant to D.C. Local Civil Rules), ECF No. 24. Indeed, unlike the Board, U.S. district courts are statutorily authorized to appoint counsel for EEOC complainants whenever justice demands. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(1) ("Upon application by the complainant and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant and may authorize the commencement of the action without the payment of fees, costs, or security.") <span class="Italic">Fogg</span> therefore reaffirms rather than contradicts the Board's present position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lawson v. VA</span>, NY-0752-10-0185-I-1 (NP 4/10/2014) ("It is well settled, however, that the Board's authority to request <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for appellants claiming that they are mentally incompetent is limited to certain <span class="Italic">retirement</span> appeals in which appellants claim that they are mentally incompetent and present medical evidence to support such claims. <span class="Italic">Vaughn v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not guarantee an attorney because it has no obligation to appoint counsel. <span class="Italic">Grassell v.

The statutory right to representation is limited by the ability to obtain and retain counsel. <span class="Italic">Feathers v.

Cir. 1988) (patent application case: discussing various bases for appointed counsel, but determining there was no authority to appoint counsel for an indigent petitioner in the civil case before the court). Nevertheless, some regional and field offices of the Board maintain lists of attorneys who are willing to consider undertaking cases for indigent appellants <span class="Italic">pro bono</span>, and the Federal Circuit Bar Association has a <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation program for appeals and for Board cases taken to that court. <a href="http://www.fedcirbar.org/Pro-Bono-Scholarships/Government-Employees-Pro-Bono/Overview-FAQ">http://www.fedcirbar.org/Pro-Bono-Scholarships/Government-Employees-Pro-Bono/Overview-FAQ</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted that the Board is not required to appoint or secure counsel for an appellant in an adverse action (not involving circumstances implicated by the <span class="Italic">French</span> decision), <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Dept. of Arm</span>y, 466 Fed. Appx. 869, 873 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, as to Mr. Tyler's argument that he did not receive a fair trial because he was proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span> at the time of the hearing, we note that Mr. Tyler was represented by counsel until a month before the hearing, and that during this time he did not indicate an intention to offer witnesses. The record does not, moreover, reflect that Mr. Tyler requested a continuance for the purpose of seeking new counsel. In any event, civil litigants are not entitled to representation, and the absence of counsel does not make proceedings inherently unfair. <span class="Italic">Lariscey v. United States</span>, 861 F.2d 1267, 1270 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("The [Supreme]Court [has]stated the strong presumption that a right to appointed counsel exists only when the indigent may lose his/her personal freedom if the action is lost.... Beyond this narrow framework, the Supreme Court has not recognized a constitutional right to appointed counsel in civil matters."). We are aware of no authority by which the MSPB was obligated to provide counsel to Mr. Tyler.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Advice of the right to representation in both the agency notices of Board appeal rights and in the MSPB appeal form sufficiently advises employees of their statutory right to representation. <span class="Italic">Tiffany v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 795 F.2d 67 (Fed. Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">McClintock v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 475, 477, 6 MSPB 402 (1981), confirmed the adequacy of the Board's notices of the right to representation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant contends that he should be provided another hearing because he did not receive sufficient notice to allow him to obtain legal representation for the hearing. The record, however, clearly shows that appellant and his designated representative, the union local, received adequate notice of the hearing. But even if adequate notice was not received, we would not find error since appellant had the opportunity to designate an attorney as his representative from the day he filed his appeal, but failed to do so; and because there is no indication in the record that he ever requested the presiding official to postpone the hearing to provide him time to engage an attorney.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, rejecting a claim of due process denial through lack of representation, noted in <span class="Italic">Lawson v. VA</span>, NY-0752-10-0185-I-1 (NP 4/10/2014), that the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> efforts had effect in the proceedings before the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant may be arguing that she was disadvantaged because the agency was represented by an attorney while she was not so represented, such a claim is not a basis for disturbing the initial decision because the appellant had a full and fair opportunity to designate her own representative, <span class="Italic">see Burge</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 32. The record reflects, for example, that the administrative judge placed this case on the suspense calendar specifically to afford the appellant additional time to designate an attorney or a non-attorney representative. The administrative judge further advised the appellant on multiple occasions that her representative need not be an attorney and that she could, for instance, be assisted by a friend, neighbor, or relative. In these circumstances, the appellant's inability to find and designate a representative below is not a basis for disturbing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Burge</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 32; <span class="Italic">Feathers v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 485, 487 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A representative need not be an attorney. An appellant may choose to have corepresentatives. <span class="Italic">Moye v. VA</span>, 10 MSPR 448, 451 (1982). To the ranks of counsel and co-counsel are added "technical representatives" who most often accompany agency counsel. "The Board has long recognized the appropriateness of the presence of a technical advisor during the course of a hearing." <span class="Italic">Low v. Dept. of Energy</span>, DA-0752-14-0086-I-1 (NP 9/24/2014). Normally, the presence or absence of a representative is not a problem, and many cases are pursued by appellants without any counsel. The only real regulatory restrictions on representatives are that they be designated by pleading, including appropriate electronic filing, 5 CFR 1201.31(a) and 1201.114(a) (2022), and that they not be involved in a conflict of interest or position. An appellant who fails to designate his representative properly may find that the representative cannot participate in the appeal while it is pending before the Board; however, an AJ should not employ an extreme sanction, such as striking evidence submitted by an undesignated representative, without notice to the appellant that his appeal was procedurally deficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Averella v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 181, 184 (1993); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gaff v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 45 MSPR 387, 391 (1990) (initial decision would not be reversed based on the appellants' contention that they did not know the identity of the agency representative because the agency failed to serve a designation form on the appellants; no showing of prejudice); <span id="Page_1202"></span><span class="Italic">Cresson v.
