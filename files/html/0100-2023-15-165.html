<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-164"><span class="space">B.</span> SEXUAL MISCONDUCT</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual misconduct, often characterized as sexual harassment or creation of a hostile working environment, defies uniform definition. Harassment may be subjective; what passes as offensive to one person may be harmless to another. The difficulties inherent in the distinctions and definitions were pointed out by Judge Nichols of the Federal Circuit, who, in an effort to avoid further defining "hostile environment" sexual harassment, would have affirmed the Board decision on the basis of a more readily verifiable occurrence of "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" harassment. Said the judge in a concurrence to <span class="Italic">Marshall v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3383):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I can't help reading some of our and other lower court opinions as holding that the annoyance and mental distress caused by an over-amorous supervisor may of itself constitute a hostile environment, as much as an under-amorous attitude would do, and one might have to resort to such a theory if, unlike here, the supervisor offered nothing in return, or if he engaged in objectionable behavior such as fanny-pinching, which would anticipate no reciprocity. Here we don't need it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It seems to me our problem is we know what behavior women employees should be protected against in the workplace, but we don't know how to define it, and have failed to do so in our published cases. Perhaps other courts, in cases not brought to our attention, have done better. In the absence of clear definitions, it appears to me we should stick to the short path and affirm the board where it is easy to do so, not on its finding that an ill-defined offense was also somehow committed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Nies added some practical guidance in a dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Carter v. SSA, DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3088), involving relatively minor harassment charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A situation such as this one should not necessitate bringing the matter to the courts. It cries for personal resolution by the parties involved. We live in a changing society, and all of us need to gain new insights into relationships between men and women. A complainant should be able to make the insult to that person's integrity known; the offending party should listen, learn, and gain understanding. This could be accomplished within the agency before an experienced counselor. Both parties need counseling to come out of the situation with restored dignity. Litigation cannot possibly achieve that desired end.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the suggestions of Judge Nies, sexual harassment charges result in some counseling, many disciplinary actions, and a lot of litigation. The Board published two studies on sexual harassment in the workplace, finding it to be a continuing problem for those who perceive harassment on the job--however they may define it and however they are affected by it. The Board is not charitable toward those who sexually harass coworkers or subordinates. However, the Board cautions that although courts have often upheld dismissals of federal employees for sexual misconduct, the evidence must be weighed with particular care if the charges place a "badge of infamy" on the employee. <span class="Italic">Meier v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MEIER_SE075209007_OPINION_AND_ORDER_252890.pdf">3 MSPR 247</a>, 256, 3 MSPB 341 (1980). Conflicting testimony in the record can be expected in an appeal involving a charge of sexual harassment: the record may comprise only the testimony of the employee charged with misconduct and the testimony of the harassed employee. The Board then makes witness credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">Mazza v. U.S. Postal Inspection Serv.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1598) (citing <span class="Italic">Carosella v. USPS</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 641 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). These determinations must take into consideration the nature of hearsay, if the agency depends on it, and the reliability of the witnesses who testify in support of or against the charges. The Federal Circuit criticized the Board for its failure to properly examine the record, <span class="Italic">Gamboa v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3129):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellate courts do not determine credibility, nor do they reweigh evidence. In reviewing the MSPB under the substantial evidence standard of review, we must affirm a decision that is "supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938) (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">See also Jacobs</span>, 35 F.3d at 1546; <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, 8 F.3d at 804. At the same time, we are not free simply to view one side of the argument. As the Supreme Court has admonished, "[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight." <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). <span class="Italic">Accord Jacobs</span>, 35 F.3d at 1546-47 (relying on <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span>); <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, 8 F.3d at 804 (same); <span class="Italic">Spurlock v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 894 F.2d 1328, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> and its progeny make clear, whether evidence is substantial is not an abstract question but a contextual one. This is particularly true of sexual harassment cases, in which the substantive law requires an inquiry into the context of the allegations. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 114 S. Ct. 367, 371 (1993); <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986). "In determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment, the Commission [the EEOC] will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisprudence concerning sexual harassment has been developed largely through cases brought by plaintiffs under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified as amended at 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> In contrast, this case, like most personnel cases before this court, is brought in a defensive posture: a government employee appeals an adverse agency action based on the agency's determination that the employee acted in violation of statute or regulation. It is well established that sexual harassment, as defined by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a) (1994), entails the jurisprudence developed under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 65; <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1579-80 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Carosella v. USPS</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 640 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the nature of the offense, it is often the case that sexual harassment is unwitnessed, and no good evidence exists to support the word of one party over the other. When fresh complaint is made, the absence of either physical corroboration or witnesses is not hard to understand. When a long-standing pattern of conduct is alleged, however, and corroborating evidence is weak or non-existent, then the circumstances of the allegations must bulk large in the consideration of the adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, and with due regard to the standard of review mandated by Congress, this court is careful to consider the context in which harassment is alleged to have occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., King</span>, 21 F.3d 1572; <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Carosella</span>, 816 F.2d 638; <span class="Italic">Downes v. FAA</span>, 775 F.2d 288 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">disapproved on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 370-71; <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2650"></span>Although sexual harassment will normally come to the fore through misconduct charges, an agency may also charge a performance deficiency. <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 239-40 (1993) ("We affirm the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to meet the performance standards in a critical element of his position, dealing with the implementation of the agency's equal employment opportunity policies....&#8197;[G]iven that we sustain the charge of sexual harassment, the agency has established that the appellant failed to take steps to eradicate discrimination against women or to maintain an office free of sexual harassment.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although much of the discussion that follows addresses what is characterized as sexual harassment, a charge need not be phrased in terms of harassment to serve as a basis for discipline against an appellant for sexually inappropriate conduct. Agencies often phrase charges concerning inappropriate conduct as conduct that is immoral, disgraceful, or unbecoming a federal employee. The charge may also be stated in terms of offensive contact or touching. In <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 502, 506 (1993), removal was sustained, and mitigation by the AJ set aside, for a single instance of offensive physical contact with a female coworker. The Board explained that "even a single instance of indecent and disgraceful conduct toward a coworker can support a penalty of removal; there need not be a pattern of such behavior before removal is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Teichmann v. Department of Navy</span> [sic], 34 MSPR 447 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 854 F.2d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table)." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Handon v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3255) (sustaining removal of employee who gave unwelcome back rubs and made offensive statements and gestures to female employees). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Woodford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 350, 357-58 (1997) (mitigating removal of a manager to demotion to a nonsupervisory position based on a single instance of nonsexual touching; the penalty was mitigated by a long and distinguished record of service, a demonstration of remorse, isolation of the incident, and the general demeanor of the manager as supportive of women; there was no basis for the female employee to expect a repetition of the harassment). Discipline was sustained in <span class="Italic">Uske v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 544, 560 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Uske v. USPS</span>, 56 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1995), against a supervisory employee who took and published a photo of a nude model in an agency facility. Although the circulation of prurient material among employees while on duty was "a common occurrence," the Board concluded that "[i]t is certainly inappropriate for a supervisor to foster such a working environment."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency's effort to define sexual misconduct in terms other than sexual harassment may lead the Board to undertake a convoluted examination of logic and lexicography when application of common sense would do. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 309, 311-12 (1995), struggled with the concept of what it took to establish "gross misconduct of a sexual nature":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency based its charge of "gross misconduct of a sexual nature" upon four allegations of misconduct. First, the agency alleged that the appellant remarked as a female employee walked by, "That girl looks like good supervisory material. I'm the supervisor, and she can be my material." Second, it asserted that the appellant stated on several occasions that he does not approve sick or annual leave but that he might approve "sex leave." Third, it averred that the appellant stated that he wished he had a video tape made of his vasectomy because his penis had been so big, black, blue, and swollen that he could have sold a copy to every woman at Tinker Air Force Base. Fourth, it contended that the appellant allowed a video tape of a nude female employee...(who had previously been romantically involved with the appellant) in the workplace and that he fostered its showing to other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency proved the first three factual specifications by a preponderance of the evidence, but not the fourth specification concerning the video tape. He determined, however, that, in order to prove that the misconduct constituted gross misconduct of a sexual nature, the agency must show that the conduct was unethical, immoral, or indecent conduct, or a wanton disregard of directives, and he found that the agency failed to make such a showing. In its petition for review, the agency asserts that the administrative judge erred by requiring it to show that the appellant's conduct was unethical, immoral, or indecent conduct, or a wanton disregard of directives, and that it was only required to show that the appellant engaged in gross misconduct of a sexual nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge misconstrued this charge. The agency did not charge the appellant with engaging in conduct that <span class="Italic">was</span> "unethical, immoral[,] or indecent." Instead, the notice of proposed removal charged him with conduct "that <span class="Italic">can be construed</span> as being unethical, immoral[,] or indecent." The agency also referred to the appellant's responsibility as a supervisor to "insure the work place is free from any type of conduct or behavior that gives even the appearance that sexually offensive actions or speech is accepted or condoned by the [agency]." Thus, by nature of the language of the notice of proposed removal, the agency should not have been required to show that the appellant's misconduct was unethical, immoral, or indecent, merely that the appellant's actions could be construed as such.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, merely on the basis of the three sustained factual specifications, the appellant's misconduct constituted "gross misconduct of a sexual nature" under this definition. Particularly noteworthy is the offensive nature of the "supervisory material" remark, as it treated a <span class="Italic">specific</span> individual as a sexual object. This flagrant misconduct can be considered "unethical, immoral[,] or indecent" and can certainly be construed as being such. We therefore find that these three specifications of the charge are sustained.</p>
