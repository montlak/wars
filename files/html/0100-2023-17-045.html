<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-45"><span class="space">B.</span> MATTERS RELATED TO STATUTORY APPEALS</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA is barred from reviewing an award covering a matter embraced by &#x00A7; 4303 and &#x00A7; 7512 and matters relating to adverse and performance based actions covered by those statutes. But an arbitrator could decide, and FLRA could then review, a challenge to the agency's failure to abide by a contract provision mandating the duration of a performance improvement period preceding a performance-based action. Although the arbitrator ordered relief for a group of employees encompassed by the grievance, the award--involving what FLRA characterized as an institutional grievance--was not excluded from FLRA review authority, <span class="Italic">Veterans Benefits Administration and AFGE Council 53</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-211.html">71 FLRA 1113</a>, 1113-16 (2020) (Chairman Kiko dissenting in part) (recon. den., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-76.html">72 FLRA 407</a> (2021)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a national&#8209;level grievance alleging that issuance of the letters violated Section 10, which governs the process for assessing bargaining unit employee performance; Article 47, requiring the Agency to bargain over changes to conditions of employment; and Article 2, requiring the Agency to comply with all federal statutes and regulations. The Agency denied the grievance, and the Union invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To remedy the violation, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to comply with Section 10, rescind any performance&#8209;based adverse actions taken against bargaining&#8209;unit employees (BUEs) who did not first receive a PIP that complied with Section 10, and reinstate any such employees, including back pay, restored leave, and other benefits. The Arbitrator also awarded the Union attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to an award "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute.[12] Generally, such matters are "those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512"[13] and are reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and, on appeal, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[14] The Authority has determined that it is without jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7121(f) when the matter is "inextricably intertwined with" a &#x00A7; 4303, &#x00A7; 7512, or similar matter.[15] In making this determination, the Authority looks, not at the outcome of the award[16] or allegations in the grievance,[17] but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that would be reviewable by the MSPB or on appeal to the Federal Circuit.[18]</p>

The gravamen of the Union's grievance is that the Agency <span id="page_1750"></span>violated its duty to bargain in good faith under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute[19] and three articles from the parties' agreement--specifically Article 27, which governs the "process" for assessing bargaining unit employee performance; Article 47, requiring the Agency to bargain over changes to conditions of employment; and Article 2, requiring the Agency to comply with all federal statutes and regulations. In short, the grievance concerns <span class="Italic">how</span> the Agency implemented certain provisions of the Accountability Act which the Union argues "exist[&#8197;] alongside and independently from the requirements" of the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator describes the genesis of the issue before him: "[t]his arbitration...arose from the Agency's decision to replace the [p]arties' practices and procedures concerning performance appraisal and improvement with new processes and procedures." Therefore, the issue at arbitration was an institutional claim, which is properly before the Authority, because it involved the Union's claim that the Agency violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement. Furthermore, the grievance is not "inextricably intertwined with" a &#x00A7; 4303, &#x00A7; 7512, or similar matter, because the fundamental nature of the grievance did not change, despite the fact that the Union introduced evidence <span class="Italic">at arbitration</span> (over the Agency's objection) that two employees had been "adversely affected" by the implementation of the Accountability Act procedures.</p>

At all times, it concerned how the Agency implemented the new procedures under the Accountability Act, whether the Agency had a duty to bargain that implementation, and whether and to what extent the Accountability Act superseded Section 10--matters that fall squarely within the Authority's jurisdiction and over which the MSPB has no authority whatsoever.</p>

<p class="noindent">There is a practical exception to FLRA's jurisdictional limitation.

The exception is limited. Matters related to claims presenting statutory appeals are generally barred from FLRA review through exceptions to arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA is barred from considering exceptions to an award that reverses an adverse action but withholds back pay.

If exceptions to an award cannot be heard by FLRA because of the preclusions of &#x00A7; 7121(f), the bar extends not only to a decision on the merits, but also to an award of counsel fees.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC, Hines and Illinois Nurses Ass'n, Hines Local</span>, 20 FLRA 510, 511 (1985), described FLRA's lack of jurisdiction over counsel fee awards associated with grievances challenging removals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his original award, the Arbitrator converted the grievant's removal for misconduct to a suspension for 90 days. The grievant, a nurse in the Agency's Department of Medicine and Surgery, was appointed under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 73. The Agency's exceptions to the original award were dismissed by the Authority for lack of jurisdiction under section 7122(a) of the Statute on the ground that the award related to a matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute because it related to a matter similar <span id="page_1751"></span>to those covered under 5 U.S.C. 7512, i.e., a removal, and had arisen under another personnel system. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Hines, Illinois and Illinois Nurses Association, Hines Local Unit</span>, 16 FLRA No. 46(1984). In his supplemental award, to which the Agency has filed the instant exceptions, the Arbitrator awarded the grievant reasonable attorney fees related to the removal action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to jurisdiction under section 7122(a), the Authority has previously indicated that an award of attorney fees by an arbitrator in supplement to the arbitrator's award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) is not separate and distinct from the award directly resolving the section 7121(f) matter. Thus, the Authority dismissed the exceptions to the supplemental award of attorney fees finding that such award related to a matter described in section 7121(f) within the meaning of section 7122(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">National Weather Service Employees Organization (MEBA, AFL-CIO) and National Weather Service, Western Region</span>, 17 FLRA No. 91(1985), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, June 26, 1985. In terms of this case, the Authority similarly finds that the supplemental award of attorney fees is not separate and distinct from the original award and that therefore the supplemental award of attorney fees likewise relates to a matter described in section 7121(f) within the meaning of section 7122(a) of the Statute. Consequently, the Authority is without jurisdiction to review the Agency's exceptions and accordingly, and apart from other considerations, they are dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case involving a counsel fee award incidental to an adverse action, FLRA declined jurisdiction over the exceptions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 834, 834-35 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has uniformly dismissed exceptions to awards pertaining to attorney fees in connection with an award resolving a matter covered under &#x00A7; 7512. Consistent with this precedent, we dismiss the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to an award "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute.[2] Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals, that are covered under &#x00A7; 7512 and are appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board) and reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, Arlington, Va., </span>61 FLRA 476, 477 (2006). In addition, &#x00A7; 7121(f) provides that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703, which pertains to judicial review by the Federal Circuit, "shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Section 7122(a) pertinently provides: "Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of this title)." Section 7121(f) pertinently provides: "In matters covered under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure..., &#x00A7; 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The phrase "relating to" in &#x00A7; 7122(a) is not defined in the Statute. The Authority has held that the phrase "relating to" applies both to the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) and to matters that are connected to the matters explicitly described in &#x00A7; 7121(f). <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2986, </span>51 FLRA 1549, 1553 (1996) (Member Armendariz dissenting as to other matters). Specifically, the Authority's position is that under &#x00A7; 7122(a), it lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to an award relating to the pure &#x00A7; 7512 matter, as well as to an award relating to a matter that is inextricably intertwined with a &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1555.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has explained that by dismissing exceptions to awards relating to matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f), as well as to the matters inextricably intertwined with them, it ensures consistency and uniformity of process and discourages forum shopping, as Congress intended. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1554. In addition, the Authority has noted that dismissing these exceptions also advances the desirable policy objective of avoiding the multiplicity of litigation over one claim that might result if aspects of the same claim were to be reviewed in more than one forum. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Authority has uniformly and repeatedly dismissed exceptions to awards pertaining to attorney fees in connection with an award relating to a matter explicitly described in &#x00A7; 7121(f). For example, in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Serv., Baltimore, Md., </span>34 FLRA 79 (1989), the Authority specifically rejected the Union's claim that the Authority had jurisdiction to resolve its exception that the arbitrator's denial of an award of attorney fees in connection with the arbitrator's mitigation of a 30-day suspension to a reprimand was deficient. The Authority ruled that "an award resolving a request for attorney fees which supplements an award relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) is not separate and distinct from the award resolving the &#x00A7; 7121(f) matter." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 81; <span class="Italic">accord Overseas Educ. Ass'n,</span> 46 FLRA 1145 (1993); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Army Air Def. Ctr., Fort Bliss, Tex., </span>35 FLRA 970 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in order to ensure consistency and uniformity of process and to avoid multiplicity of litigation, the Authority defers to jurisdictional determinations of the Federal Circuit. As relevant here, the Federal Circuit has uniformly and repeatedly ruled that awards pertaining to attorney fees in connection with an award over a matter covered under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512 are judicially reviewable under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(f) and 7703. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Morrison v. Nat'l Science Found., </span>423 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Raney v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </span>222 F.3d 927 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Accordingly, the Authority's approach to this issue is consistent with that of the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency has not established any reason for severing the issue of eligibility for an award of fees from the merits resolution of the request for fees. In our view, this would lead undesirably to even more multiplicity of litigation were the Authority to review the eligibility aspects of a request for attorney fees while the Federal Circuit reviewed the merits of the resolution of the request for fees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VA Great Lakes Nat'l Cemetery</span>, 64 FLRA 670, 671 (2010), reiterated the lack of FLRA's jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's determination involving a counsel fee application arising from a grievance over an adverse action (removal mitigated to a reprimand):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to awards "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals, that are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and are appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va.,</span> 61 FLRA 476, 477 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) "when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with," a &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1013, </span>60 FLRA 712, 713 (2005). In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one reviewable by the MSPB, and, on appeal, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this precedent, we conclude that the award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. The claim advanced before the Arbitrator relates to the grievant's removal. Moreover, the Union itself asserts, in its response to the Order to Show Cause, that the attorney fee award is "inextricably intertwined with" the grievant's removal. In these circumstances, therefore, we find that the award relates to the grievant's removal. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Fort Worth, Tex.,</span> 61 FLRA 834 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">The denial of step increases claimed to be due when a removal was reversed by an arbitrator was beyond FLRA's exceptions jurisdiction because the dispute related to a removal, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3369 and SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-120.html">72 FLRA 619</a>, 619-20 (2022) (Chairman DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we remind the federal labor relations community that, under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review a supplemental award when it resolves a removal claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Brenda P. Strashun found that the grievant violated Agency policy and "deserved serious discipline" for those violations, but that the Agency did not have just cause for removing the grievant. Therefore, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to reinstate the grievant. Thereafter, the award was returned to the Arbitrator for clarification regarding whether the grievant would be eligible for the within-grade pay increases (WIGIs) that would have accrued between the date of termination and the date of reinstatement (the removal period). The Arbitrator subsequently found that the grievant did not meet the statutory prerequisites to be eligible for WIGIs covering the removal period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The main question before us is whether the clarification award is inextricably intertwined with a removal even though the clarification award concerns the grievant's entitlement to WIGIs. Because the clarification award resolves the underlying removal action, we find that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review the award under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and Arbitrator's Award</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the grievant was removed from employment for alleged violations of the Agency's systems access policy (the policy). Thereafter, the Union filed a grievance asserting that the grievant was removed by the Agency without just cause. The parties were unable to resolve the grievance and the dispute proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the first decision, the Arbitrator found that the Agency did not have just cause for the grievant's removal but the grievant deserved discipline for violating the policy. Consequently, the Arbitrator ordered that the Agency reinstate the grievant, but that the grievant forfeit all back pay and all benefits from the removal period. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency reinstated the grievant at the same pay grade and step that the grievant had earned when terminated. The Agency rejected the <span id="page_1752"></span>Union's argument that the grievant was entitled to the WIGIs the grievant could have earned if the grievant had worked during the removal period. The Union then invoked Article 25, Section 5.H of the parties' agreement--which states that "[i]f the arbitration award is unclear to either party, the award shall be returned to the arbitrator for clarification"--so that the Arbitrator could issue a clarification as to whether the award entitled the grievant to the WIGIs for the removal period. Following a hearing and submissions from both parties, the Arbitrator subsequently issued a clarification award, finding that the grievant did not meet the statutory prerequisites to be eligible for WIGIs covering the removal period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to an award "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute.[8] Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals,[9] that are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512.[10] The Authority will determine that an award "relates to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when it resolves, or is "inextricably intertwined" with a matter covered under &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512.[11] In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that would be reviewed by the Merit Systems Protection Board and, on appeal, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[12] Additionally, the Authority has previously held that it lacks jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute to review a supplemental award that resolves a removal claim by specifically providing remedies for an unlawful removal.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that the grievance concerns a removal and the Arbitrator found in the award that there was not just cause for removing the grievant. Thereafter, the Union sought a clarification from the Arbitrator to consider an outstanding issue--the grievant's entitlement to WIGIs--and resolve the Union's grievance. Accordingly, because the clarification award resolved the removal claim by finding that the grievant was not entitled to any WIGIs that would have accrued from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement, the clarification award is related to a removal within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute.[17] Therefore, we conclude that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review the Union's exceptions.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Although the Authority has not had occasion to directly address whether a substantive arbitrability determination is inextricably intertwined with a removal matter, in reviewing an arbitrator's substantive arbitrability determination related to the removal of an employee without MSPB appeal rights, the Authority stated that, had the employee had such rights, it would have lacked jurisdiction to review the award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA 456, 458 n.2 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency concedes that "removal is involved," it asserts that the Authority has jurisdiction to review its exceptions because it is challenging the Arbitrator's substantive arbitrability decision, which it claims is "separate from the actual removal decision or, at most, minimally related to the actual removal." As in the cases involving procedural arbitrability cited above, here, the Arbitrator's determination that the <span id="page_1753"></span>grievance was substantively arbitrable under the LCA is inextricably intertwined with the grievance over the grievant's removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. In this regard, the grievance concerns whether the grievant can grieve a removal action under the parties' agreement and, if so, whether the grievant's removal was for just cause. Consequently, the resolution of the removal matter is dependent on the Arbitrator's resolution of the substantive arbitrability determination before the Arbitrator and the two matters are inextricably intertwined. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1770</span>, 62 FLRA at 504. As such, the Agency's exceptions are not within the Authority's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further claims that the Authority should resolve its exceptions because "this is not the sort of matter that the [MSPB] would consider reviewable" because the MSPB recognizes the validity of LCAs. However, the Agency provides no evidence to support this contention. In this regard, the MSPB has been explicitly granted jurisdiction to review removals.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. In addition, contrary to the Agency's claim, the MSPB has reviewed whether LCAs waived parties' appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nunley v. United States Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 305, 308 (1991) (reviewing administrative judge's interpretation of parties' LCA, and remanding to judge where he did not determine what the parties intended to be the proper construction of this agreement); <span class="Italic">Ferby v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 451, 456 (1985) (MSPB had authority to enforce LCAs). Accordingly, the Agency's exception does not establish that the Authority has jurisdiction to resolve the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the forgoing, we find that the issues before the Arbitrator related to the grievant's removal and dismiss the Agency's exceptions for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In less than pellucid analysis, FLRA ruled that a dispute over the coverage of an agreement settling an adverse action case grieved to arbitration is not reviewable by FLRA. It was immaterial that the matter deemed excluded under &#x00A7; 7121(f) was a claim by management that was not included in the settlement if the claim related to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Army Armament Research, Dev., and Eng'g Ctr., Dover and NFFE Local 1447</span>, 24 FLRA 837, 838-39 (1986) (claim by an agency for reimbursement of money lost by alleged travel voucher fraud was precluded because the claim related to removal settled following grievance); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 572 and Naval Reg.

<p class="noindent">Enforcement or compliance issues associated with settlement of a removal case and raised in an arbitration subsequent to the removal case could not be pursued to FLRA through exceptions to the arbitration award resolving the compliance issues. The award related to the removal, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NAATS</span>, 57 FLRA 580, 581 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that the Authority has jurisdiction over this matter because the supplemental award resolves an issue covered by the settlement agreement. On its face, the supplemental award resolves only the issue of remedies for the removal, and any reference by the Arbitrator to the parties' settlement agreement was limited to resolving that issue. Moreover, even if the award could be construed as enforcing the parties' settlement agreement, that fact alone would not confer jurisdiction upon the Authority. In this regard, the Authority has found that awards that enforce settlement agreements relating to a removal action are "inextricably intertwined" with the original removal action. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> Local 2094</span>, 51 FLRA 1612 (1996); <span class="Italic">United States Army Armament Research</span>,<span class="Italic"> Dev.</span>,<span class="Italic"> and Eng'g Ctr. (ARDEC)</span>,<span class="Italic"> Dover</span>,<span class="Italic"> N.J</span>., 24 FLRA 837, 838-39 (1986). Further, the Agency has not demonstrated that the fact that the Arbitrator considered the parties' informal settlement of a ULP affects the application of &#x00A7; 7122(a) to the award. Therefore, these Agency arguments fail to establish that the supplemental award does not "relate to" the removal within the meaning of 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, <span class="Italic">State of Oregon</span> [51 FLRA 1549], on which the Agency relies, is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">State of Oregon</span>, the Authority considered whether an award regarding severance pay related to the underlying removal. Unlike that award, however, the supplemental award in this case specifically provides remedies for an unlawful removal, which is a matter excluded from the Authority's jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a). Also, the Agency's assertion that entitlement to equitable relief and compensatory damages depends on factors other than the removal itself is not persuasive. In particular, the Agency's argument ignores the facts that the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act and that compensatory damages are appropriate remedies for such a violation. <span class="Italic">See </span>42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1) (1994). Finally, the Agency's assertion that the remedies were awarded for actions occurring after the grievant's removal is unsupported. On its face, the supplemental award provides a remedy for the grievant's removal and makes no reference to any subsequent actions. Therefore, the Authority lacks jurisdiction in this matter under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determined in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2094 and VAMC, New York, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 1612, 1615-16 (1996), that it lacked jurisdiction to consider exceptions to an award involving interpretation of a settlement resulting from a removal action that could have been appealed to MSPB but that was instead settled through the grievance and arbitration process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result of this statutory scheme, we will dismiss for lack of jurisdiction exceptions to awards that are a substitute for a decision of the MSPB and are reviewable by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. For the following reasons, we conclude that an arbitration award resolving an alleged breach of a settlement agreement resolving a removal is a substitute for a decision of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, when an employee has elected to appeal a matter covered under section 4303 or section 7512 to the MSPB, the parties may agree to settle the appeal. Under the MSPB's regulations, a settlement agreement is a final and binding resolution of the appeal, and the judge will dismiss the appeal with prejudice. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(c). If the parties offer the agreement for inclusion in the record and the judge approves the agreement, it will be made part of the record, and the MSPB will retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement. If the agreement is not entered into the record, the MSPB will not retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, in cases in which a settlement agreement has been entered into the record, the MSPB will issue a compliance and enforcement decision resolving allegations that the agreement was breached. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Richardson v. EPA</span>, 5 MSPR 248 (1981). Although the enforcement action, itself, is not a matter expressly covered under section 4303 or section 7512, <span class="Italic">King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the compliance action is viewed as "inextricably linked" to the original personnel action that was dismissed as a result of the settlement agreement and is reviewable by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under the provisions of section 7703. <span class="Italic">Amin v. MSPB</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1253 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employee chooses to file a grievance over a removal rather than appeal the removal to the MSPB, the eventual arbitration award is a substitute for a decision of the MSPB. Similarly, when an employee settles a dispute over the removal, and there is an alleged breach of that settlement, the award resolving the breach allegation is a substitute for the MSPB proceeding described in the preceding paragraph. It follows that an arbitration award resolving allegations of a breach of that settlement agreement constitutes an award "relating to a matter described in section 7121(f)" within the meaning 7122(a) of the Statute.[4] <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 49 FLRA 982 (1994); <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Army Armament Research</span>, <span class="Italic">Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Dover, New Jersey and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), Local 1437</span>, 24 FLRA 837 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;There is no requirement that arbitrators apply the same procedural process as the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Local 2578. AFGE v. GSA</span>, 711 F.2d 261, 264 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("[N]othing in the CSRA requires that arbitration and MSPB actions always adhere to the same standards and procedures[.]"). Thus, we will not require the application of MSPB's settlement formalities in arbitration in order to find that an award resolving whether an agency breached an agreement settling a grievance raising a matter covered under section 4303 or section 7512 is a substitute for an MSPB decision on a petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chapter 52</span>, 70 FLRA 680, 685 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), FLRA deemed to be distinct from a removal that resulted in an arbitration award a settlement dispute over the level of a performance rating for a period of time covered by the removal. FLRA explained that the settlement specifically excluded the appraisal and compliance with the settlement. Member DuBester had the better argument, but not the majority FLRA vote, as he explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that if "an employee chooses to file a grievance over a removal rather than appeal the removal to the MSPB, the eventual arbitration award is a substitute for a decision of the MSPB."[7] Further, consistent with MSPB and Federal Circuit precedent, when an arbitration award resolves a dispute over a removal, and there is alleged noncompliance with that award, a subsequent award resolving the noncompliance allegation is inextricably intertwined with a &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 matter.[8] Although an agency's noncompliance with an award is not a matter expressly covered under &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512,[9] the agency's noncompliance is, as the Federal Circuit has expressed it, "inextricably linked" to the original personnel action that was covered under those provisions.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In its abbreviated analysis, the majority simply adopts, with little discussion, the Agency's claim that the Authority has jurisdiction in this case. The Agency claims that the Authority has jurisdiction because "[t]he sole personnel action at issue" here is the grievant's "not-ratable" (NR) appraisal, not the grievant's removal. The Agency's claims lack merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The 2016 award before the Authority in this case is inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal. The parties agreed to arbitrate the grievant's removal, resulting in the 2012 Awards. After the 2012 Awards issued, the Agency gave the grievant an NR appraisal. Because the 2012 Awards resolve the matter of the grievant's removal, the Arbitrator's 2016 Award, examining whether the NR appraisal complied with the 2012 Awards, is inextricably intertwined with the original removal action that gave rise to the 2012 Awards.[13] And because the 2016 Award serves as a substitute for an MSPB decision on a petition for enforcement,[14] the award is reviewable only by the Federal Circuit[15]--not the Authority.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that this case involves a question of contract interpretation--a matter that the Authority "routinely" reviews. But, applying the precedent discussed above, the Authority has held that, "where the [question] is not separate and distinct from the original issue of the grievant's removal, the [a]rbitrator's award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute."[21] Here, because the agreement resolved the grievant's removal, the question of the agreement's interpretation is not separate and distinct from the original removal decision itself.[23] For that reason, the Arbitrator's award interpreting the agreement was inextricably intertwined with the original removal action that gave rise to the agreement.[24] Consequently, we conclude that the claim that the Union advanced in arbitration related to the grievant's removal.

The matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 include removals. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1013</span>, 60 FLRA at 713. Arbitration awards resolving these matters are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(f) and 7703.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) "when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with," a &#x00A7; 4303, &#x00A7; 7512, or similar matter. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1013</span>, 60 FLRA at 713. In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and, on appeal, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB has been explicitly granted jurisdiction to review removals, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, as well as to award compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(c). Further, the MSPB has repeatedly held that its jurisdiction is determined by the nature of an agency's action against a particular appellant at the time an appeal is filed with the MSPB and, generally, an agency's unilateral modification of its adverse action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the MSPB of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to such divestiture, or unless the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Himmel v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 484, 486 (1981). However, when an appellant has outstanding, viable claims for compensatory damages before the MSPB, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not afford the appellant all of the relief available before the MSPB, and, therefore, mere rescission does not render the appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See Currier v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 197 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Currier</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Union specifically asserted that the grievance "concern[ed] the [g]rievant's removal[,]" Union's Closing Brief at 5, Attachment to Agency's Opposition, and advanced the following claim: "Is the grievant entitled to additional remedies beyond the rescission of the removal?" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Union also asserted that the grievant was entitled to additional remedies based on the "enormous stress and depression" the grievant suffered as a result of being removed and wrongfully accused of the charges in the removal notice. Award at 5-6. In denying the Union's request for additional remedies, the Arbitrator found that the Agency "had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason" for issuing the removal, and "did not procrastinate in absolving [the] grievant and dismissing the charges" once it received additional evidence pertaining to the charges that formed the basis for the grievant's removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 16, 15. There is no evidence that the relief sought by the Union depends on factors other than the removal. Thus, we find that the remedial issues before the Arbitrator were inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the fact that the Agency modified its adverse action after the grievance was filed does not alter the fact that the grievant's claims for relief are the types of matters that would be resolved by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Currier</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 197. Thus, despite the Agency's complete rescission of the grievant's removal and restoration to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the grievant's claim for compensatory damages remained viable and, therefore, the MSPB and the Federal Circuit would not have been deprived of jurisdiction by virtue of the rescission of the removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Gettysburg</span>, 61 FLRA 849, that case is distinguishable from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Gettysburg</span>, the Authority found that a grievance concerning the revocation of a grievant's law enforcement commission was not inextricably intertwined with a separate grievance involving the grievant's removal. Thus, in that case, there were multiple grievances, and the remedies sought were not tied solely to the grievant's removal. By contrast, here, there is only one grievance, it concerns a removal, and the sole basis for the remedies sought by the Union is the alleged harm suffered by the grievant as a result of that removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the issues before the Arbitrator related to the grievant's removal and dismiss the Union's exceptions for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., EPA</span>, 59 FLRA at 592.</p>

FLRA declined to review the award because it related to the grievant's removal. Recounting its precedent, FLRA explained, 49 FLRA at 1485-86:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to dismissing exceptions to awards directly resolving the merits of a serious adverse action grievance controlled by section 7512 or a performance-based action grievance controlled by section 4303, the Authority also has dismissed exceptions to awards resolving issues <span id="page_1755"></span>related to the serious adverse action or performance-based action. Thus, the Authority has dismissed exceptions to awards pertaining to issues that were deemed "inseparable[,]" or not "separate and distinct[,]" from the serious adverse action or performance-based action, itself, or to issues that were "inherently related" to such matters. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix District and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 691 (1991) (awards of fees and expenses resulting from arbitrations involving matters covered by section 7121(f) "are inherently related to such matters"); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3627 and Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Region IV,</span> 31 FLRA 1178, 1180 (1988) (arbitrator resolved grievances over a short-term suspension and a subsequent removal for continuing acts of insubordination; Authority determined that suspension was an "inseparable" part of the removal); <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Dover, New Jersey and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), Local 1437</span>, 24 FLRA 837, 839 (1986) (award interpreting and applying agreement settling the issue of the grievant's removal was not "separate and distinct" from the issue of the removal); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Hines, Illinois and Illinois Nurses Association, Hines Local Unit</span>, 20 FLRA 510, 511 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Association</span>) (awards of attorney fees by an arbitrator in supplement to an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) is not "separate and distinct" from the award resolving the section 7121(f) matter).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Missile Command and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1858</span>, 28 FLRA 11 (1987), the Authority also dismissed exceptions to an award pertaining to a performance appraisal because the performance appraisal was the basis for the grievant's subsequent removal for unacceptable performance. In addition, as noted by the Agency, in <span class="Italic">Federal Prison Camp</span> we dismissed exceptions to an award pertaining to an issue that the Union "linked" to the grievant's removal. 47 FLRA at 574. We also dismissed the exceptions in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Navy Resale Activity, Guam and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1689</span>, 40 FLRA 30 (1991). In that case, the arbitrator denied the grievance over the grievant's removal, but rescinded the agency's action of barring the employee from the naval station and awarded the grievant $500 in lieu of damages for lost wages from a job at a civilian restaurant located on the naval station. We dismissed the agency's exceptions to the portion of the award rescinding its debarment of the grievant and awarding him damages. We found that the debarment and the award of damages related to the removal of the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2986 and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Adjutant Gen., Oregon</span>, 51 FLRA 1549, 1552-55 (1996), overruled the result reached in <span class="Italic">DCAA</span>. FLRA provided a more realistic appraisal of "related to" that distinguished matters that could be appealed to MSPB and matters outside of the MSPB's jurisdiction. Once again the dispute was over severance pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) of the Statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As raised by the Union, this case presents the jurisdictional issue of whether the Arbitrator's award is "an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f)[.]" The matters described in section 7121(f) are those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 and similar matters that arise under other personnel systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3529 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Central Region</span>, 49 FLRA 1482 (1994) (<span class="Italic">DCAA</span>), the arbitrator rejected a grievance over the agency's denial of severance pay to the grievant. The Authority determined that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to the award under section 7122(a) of the Statute. The Authority held that in addition to lacking jurisdiction over awards resolving the section 4303 or 7512 action, it lacks jurisdiction over awards related to those actions. 49 FLRA at 1485. The Authority concluded that the award concerning severance pay related to the grievant's removal within the meaning of section 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On reexamination, we conclude that the majority in <span class="Italic">DCAA</span> interpreted the phrase "relating to" in section 7122(a) more broadly than is warranted by the Statute. For the reasons explained here, we conclude that the Authority has jurisdiction to review exceptions to an award resolving a grievance over severance pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The phrase "relating to" in section 7122(a) is not expressly defined in the Statute. Our task in applying the provision is complicated by the inherent ambiguity in this phrase: "relating to" may be read simply to refer to the matters described in section 7121(f), or to expand those matters to include others that are separate but connected in some manner. <span class="Italic">See Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> 1916 (1986) (defines "relate" as "to show or establish a logical connection between" and to "have reference"). As the phrase itself is ambiguous, we construe it by examining other relevant statutory provisions as well as Congressional intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two other provisions of the Statute are relevant to this inquiry: section 7121(e) and section 7121(f). The former, section 7121(e), gives an option to certain employees who decide to challenge a matter covered under section 4303 or 7512 of title 5 or similar matters arising under other personnel systems. These employees can either:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022; file a grievance over the matter under a negotiated grievance procedure (if the matter is included within the scope of the procedure); or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022; appeal the matter to the Merit Systems Protection Board (if the employee is within the MSPB's jurisdiction) or raise the matter under whatever appellate procedures, if any, are applicable (if the employee is within another personnel system).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(f) addresses the review of arbitration awards resolving the grievances encompassed by section 7121(e). For employees in the general civil service, section 7121(f) provides that if an employee has chosen the grievance option, then a resulting award has the same review as if the matter had been appealed to the MSPB. Specifically, the award is appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. For employees in other personnel systems, section 7121(f) provides that if an employee has filed a grievance over a matter similar to one covered under section 4303 or 7512, then a resulting award has the same review as if the administrative appeal option, if one exists, was chosen. Under section 7122(a), the Authority is without jurisdiction to review any of these awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the appellate forum is the same regardless of which route an employee has chosen under section 7121(e) to assert his or her claim. By ensuring that for these claims, arbitration awards and other administrative decisions are reviewed in the same appellate forum, the Statute operates to assure consistency and uniformity of process between (1) arbitration; and (2) whatever administrative appeal option is available to the affected employees. Legislative history confirms that such consistency and uniformity was what Congress intended. H. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 157 (1978) <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) 2891. In addition, this statutory scheme serves, again as Congress intended, to discourage forum shopping. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The delineation between arbitration awards that are reviewable by the Authority, and those that are not, also advances the desirable policy objective of avoiding the multiplicity of litigation over one claim that might result if different fora review aspects of the same claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case now before us, there is no question that disputes over severance pay are not covered under section 4303 or 7512. <span class="Italic">E.g., Ward v. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 8 MSPR 603, 604 (1981). Not surprisingly, there is no contention that the grievant had, or could have been provided, any choice other than the negotiated grievance procedure to contest the denial of his severance pay. Accordingly, it is clear that if the 'relating to' requirement in section 7122(a) merely serves to refer readers to section 7121(f), it would not deprive the Authority of jurisdiction over the Agency's exceptions. In addition, none of the policies identified above would be advanced by construing "relating to" broadly enough to encompass severance pay disputes. As no other forum has jurisdiction over the severance pay dispute, the Authority's assertion of jurisdiction will not encourage forum shopping or multiple litigation or otherwise create the possibility of inconsistent procedures or results.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with our dissenting colleague that the phrase "relating to" permits the Authority to decline jurisdiction over more awards than those that resolve the "pure" section 4303 or 7512 matter. For example, the Authority may decline jurisdiction because an award is inextricably intertwined with a section 4303 or 7512 matters.[5] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Hines, Illinois and Illinois Nurses Association, Hines Local Unit</span>, 20 FLRA 510, 511 (1985) (Authority declined jurisdiction over an attorney fee award because the award was a supplement to the arbitrator's award on the matter described in section 7121(f)); <span class="Italic">cf. FLRA v. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 890 (4th Cir. 1992) (under section 7116(d) of the Statute, jurisdiction over minor disciplinary actions lies with the MSPB when the action ripens into a section 4303 or 7512 action). However, we find no basis--statutory or policy--to decline jurisdiction in cases such as this. To do so would deprive parties of review of awards, a result neither required by the Statute nor needed to further any discernible public policy. Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">DCAA</span> and will resolve the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In this regard, we do not view severance pay as inseparable from the removal that provides the basis for that pay. Although removal from service is a necessary condition for severance pay, eligibility for severance pay depends on additional factors, such as the type of appointment under which the employee was serving <span id="page_1756"></span>and the length of the employee's service, which have no connection to the removal itself. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.704(a)(1), (2).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals, that are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Arbitration awards resolving such matters are appealable to the MSPB and reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than the Authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va., </span>61 FLRA 476, 477 (2006). Consistent with the plain wording of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction not only over awards that resolve adverse actions, but those that resolve issues <span class="Italic">related </span>to adverse actions. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2004</span>, 59 FLRA 572, 573 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with, a &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1013, </span>60 FLRA 712, 713 (2005). In determining that an award relates to a &#x00A7; 7121(f) matter, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is reviewable by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See id.; Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 49 FLRA 1398, 1401 (1994). In addition, the claims advanced in arbitration, and not the timing of the grievances, determine whether the Authority has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 58 FLRA 476, 477 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). The Authority has stated that &#x00A7; 7121(f) is based on, among other things, a policy objective of avoiding the multiplicity of litigation over one claim that might result if aspects of the same claim are reviewed in more than one forum. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2986, </span>51 FLRA 1549, 1554 (1996) (Member Armendariz dissenting)<span class="Italic">. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these principles, the Authority has declined to assert jurisdiction over additional issues resolved in arbitration where those issues were inextricably intertwined with underlying adverse actions within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7512. For example, the grievance in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, W. Va.</span>, 47 FLRA 572 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons</span>) disputed a removal action and the agency's placement of an employee on home duty status pending an investigation of disciplinary charges. The agency in that case filed exceptions to the portion of the award concerning home duty status, and the Authority found that it lacked jurisdiction to review that portion of the award because it was inextricably intertwined with the issue of the grievant's removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 574-75.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that one of the claims advanced in arbitration concerned the grievant's removal, which constitutes an adverse action within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7512. In addition, as relevant here, the grievant's removal was based on two charges: the discourteous conduct and failure to pay rent charges. Further, the Arbitrator found that the desk assignment "was a consequence of the [discourteous conduct charge]," and therefore significantly "relevant" to the grievant's removal. Moreover, this case is similar to <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prison, </span>where the Authority found that it lacked jurisdiction over the portion of the award concerning a non-adverse personnel action even though the exception did not involve the removal itself. For these reasons, we conclude that the portion of the award concerning the desk assignment relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute because it is inextricably intertwined with the issue of the grievant's removal. We note, in this regard, to find otherwise would effectively allow the Agency to litigate aspects of one claim, the removal, in multiple venues contrary to the policy objective of avoiding the multiplicity of litigation over one claim. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2986, </span>51 FLRA at 1554.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Beck dissented, arguing in <span class="Italic">Local 2789</span>, 66 FLRA at 94-95:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I disagree with the Majority's conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to resolve the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's determination that the Agency's assignment of the grievant to administrative desk duties was unwarranted is not a matter that is reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Richmond, Va., </span>65 FLRA 615, 617 (2011) (Authority looks to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that is reviewable by the MSPB); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project</span>, 65 FLRA 5, 8 (2010) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Beck) (<span class="Italic">BIA Wapato</span>).*</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor is the Arbitrator's determination about desk duties inextricably intertwined with the Agency's decision to terminate the grievant's employment. Obviously, the grievant could have been placed on desk duty without later being terminated, and could have been terminated without first being placed on desk duty. The Union presented a grievance and invoked arbitration about the assignment to desk duty in March 2008. The alleged injury that the Union sought to address was the grievant's inability to earn overtime while on desk duty. The Agency's determination to terminate the grievant came much later, in August 2009, carried entirely different consequences for the grievant, and became the subject of a second, separate grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simply put, the grievance about desk duty is easily distinguished from the grievant's eventual termination. Therefore, we are not precluded by &#x00A7; 7121(f) from reviewing the Agency's exceptions that challenge the Arbitrator's determination on that matter and his award of lost overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., Merchant Marine Acad., Kings Point, N.Y. and AFGE Local 3732</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-18.html">72 FLRA 97</a>, 98-99 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman DuBester dissenting), rejected exceptions as beyond FLRA review authority when the grievance protested the suspension of a sports coach whose team duties were removed during an investigation and that grievance was joined with a later grievance successfully challenging the removal of the coach for matters related to the subject matter of the investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority will determine that an award "relates to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when it resolves, or is "inextricably intertwined" with a matter covered under &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512.[10] In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that would be reviewed by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the issue that the parties disputed at arbitration was whether the Agency had just cause for the two personnel actions taken against the grievant. And there is no dispute that one of those personnel actions was a removal. In its opposition, the Union argues that placing the grievant on non-coaching duty was a preliminary step in the disciplinary process that led to his subsequent removal, and that the resolution of the reassignment grievance was, therefore, inextricably intertwined with the resolution of the removal grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of this position, the Union cites two instances when the Authority has held that placing an employee on reduced duty pending an investigation was inextricably intertwined with the employee's subsequent removal. In these decisions, the Authority held that a preliminary reassignment and a subsequent termination were inextricably intertwined when either (1) the two personnel actions were both the "consequence" of the same alleged misconduct,[14] or (2) when the reassignment was considered at arbitration as a factor in the removal issue.[15] Thus, even where the exception concerned a portion of the award that did not involve the removal itself, the interrelationship between the challenged agency actions necessitated a finding that the Authority lacked jurisdiction.[16]</p>

The Agency attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">Customs</span> on the basis that "the Arbitrator recognized the Agency acted separately and for different reasons" when it reassigned the grievant as compared to when it removed the grievant.

In this regard, we <span id="page_1757"></span>note that, here, the Arbitrator considered the grievant's lack of compliance with the conditions of the reassignment as one of the five specifications for his removal.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency disputes that the grievant's reassignment was a consequence of his alleged failure to supervise the team that contributed to his removal. The Agency's argument--which frames the reassignment as an administrative, rather than disciplinary action[18]--is weakened by the Agency's failure to provide any rationale for removing a long-serving head coach with a successful record from coaching responsibilities or for prohibiting him from any contact with the team. Furthermore, the Agency's characterization of the action as unrelated to the investigation of the hazing incident is contradicted by its statements throughout the negotiated grievance process. For example, in the Agency's Step 1 grievance response, it stated, "the matter [of the soccer team] is under investigation by the [OIG], which has not yet issued its report. You have been assigned to other duties pending the completion of the investigation." Moreover, in weighing whether the Agency had just cause for refusing to return the grievant to coaching duties once the soccer program was reinstated, the Arbitrator considered the same factual findings she used in evaluating the removal grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;The Arbitrator determined that--contrary to the Agency's characterization--the reassignment was an adverse action requiring just cause. Award at 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency, the Arbitrator, and the Union treated the two personnel actions as related, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction, under &#x00A7; 7122(a), to review the Agency's exceptions.[22]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Customs Serv</span>., 57 FLRA at 806 (notwithstanding the parties' election to arbitrate probationary period issue separately and as a preliminary matter, the issue was "inextricably intertwined" with the removal, so the Authority lacked jurisdiction). Member Kiko notes that she shares Member Abbott's serious concerns with the Arbitrator's disregard for federal policies in place to protect victims of harassment and discrimination. She emphasizes that the role entrusted to coaches--as teachers and leaders of student athletes--requires a greater awareness of the safety and wellbeing of their charges, and it carries with it an affirmative duty to enforce anti&#8209;harassment policies. Member Kiko notes that agencies should act when supervisors have serious doubts about the ability of an employee to maintain a safe work environment--particularly in response to such an appalling incident--and the Arbitrator's indifference to this duty is troubling.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2986, supra</span>, if an exception to an award concerned a matter collateral to the dispute over a removal that would not be within FLRA's jurisdiction, FLRA could determine that the case was properly within its review jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a). But the instances of jurisdiction over collateral disputes were rare. <span class="Italic">Compare AFGE Local 169 and Tinker AFB, Air Logistics Ctr., Oklahoma City</span>, 7 FLRA 27, 28 n.2 (1981) ("However, the arbitrator's award does not in any respect address the merits of the grievant's removal, but instead pertains only to the question of whether the grievance was arbitrable under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the arbitrator's award concerns a discrete issue collateral to the dispute over the grievant's removal and is therefore properly subject to review by the Authority under section 7122(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and American Federation of Government Employees, National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council</span>, 6 FLRA No. 12(1981)."), <span class="Italic">with Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Phoenix Dist. and NTEU, Chap. 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 691 (1991) (declining to review award of witness fees in demotion case).</p>
<p class="noindent">The circumstances of collateral review are at times unclear. In <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Alderson and AFGE Local 1494</span>, 47 FLRA 572, 574-75 (1993), reviewed in arbitration were the grievant's removal and "home duty status" during the agency's investigation of the disciplinary charges. The arbitrator reduced the removal to a 60-day suspension, and he ordered the agency to cease placing employees on home duty status. FLRA concluded that the issue of home duty status was related to the award concerning the employee's removal; the matter was then removed from FLRA review by &#x00A7; 7122(a). FLRA's reasoning was sparse, and the result reached seemed questionable. The Federal Circuit would not likely review an issue concerning home duty status unless it were the equivalent of an indefinite suspension--and nothing from the FLRA opinion suggested the two were the same. As a result, the arbitrator's award on the use of the home duty status may have been shielded from any review.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2004 and Defense Distribution Depot Susquehanna</span>, 59 FLRA 572, 572-73 (2004), declined to entertain exceptions to an award sustaining a reduction in grade but awarding some pay that seemed linked to the adverse action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated the issue as whether the Agency had just cause to reduce the grievant in grade.&#x2003;She determined that the Agency's charge of AWOL was unsupported. She ruled that the grievant should not have been charged with AWOL and that his pay should not have been reduced. Nevertheless, she determined that on the basis of the remaining charges, the Agency had just cause to reduce the grievant in grade.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also ruled that "[f]rom the time his removal was proposed in October, 2001, the Grievant has been on a virtual merry-go-round of being employed, not employed and employed somewhere else." As a result, she concluded that the grievant was "entitled to compensation before the final decision became effective." She ruled that the grievant was entitled to overtime pay as a police officer for the overtime hours he would have worked between October 2001 and June 2002. In a supplemental award, the Arbitrator reaffirmed her order of monetary relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f)" of the Statute. The matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) are those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 and similar matters that arise under other personnel systems. Matters covered under &#x00A7; 7512 are serious adverse actions, such as reductions-in-grade<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Nat'l Aeronautics and Space Admin., Lewis Research Ctr., Cleveland, Ohio, </span>54 FLRA 620, 623-24 (1998). Arbitration awards relating to these matters are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than by the Authority<span class="Italic">. See </span>54 FLRA at 625.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when the award resolves a grievance over a matter covered under &#x00A7; 7512 or is inextricably intertwined with a matter covered under &#x00A7; 7512<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, </span>58 FLRA 476, 477 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). In this case, we conclude that the awards relate to the grievant's reduction-in-grade and that we do not have jurisdiction to resolve either the Agency's exceptions or the Union's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, the Union's exceptions, to the extent that they dispute the Arbitrator's determination that there was just cause to reduce the grievant in grade, concern the awards as they directly relate to the grievant's reduction-in-grade. Consequently, we have no jurisdiction to resolve these exceptions<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE Local 2836, </span>48 FLRA 1432 (1994) (exceptions disputing the arbitrator's denial of a grievance over a removal dismissed because the award related to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We similarly have no jurisdiction to resolve the Union's exception to the Arbitrator's denial of liquidated damages and the Agency's exceptions. Although the parties contend that we have jurisdiction because these exceptions concern the monetary remedies awarded by the Arbitrator, the awards, as they pertain to monetary relief for overtime and the unsupported AWOL charge, still relate to the grievant's reduction-in-grade, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Newington, Conn., </span>53 FLRA 440 (1997) (award concerning a charge of AWOL could not be separated from a removal based on that charge); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Navy Resale Activity, Guam, </span>40 FLRA 30 (1991) (portion of the award ordering monetary relief for improper actions by the agency in removing the grievant could not be separated from the award as it related to the removal). Accordingly, we dismiss the exceptions of both the Agency and the Union for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Newington and NAGE Local R1-109</span>, 53 FLRA 440, 441-43 (1997), attempted to outline what matters were "inextricably intertwined" with a matter covered by 5 USC 7512 and 4303. An employee was fired for intoxication while on duty and the AWOL assessed against him when he was sent home. The union grieved the AWOL and the employee appealed the removal to MSPB. The MSPB case was settled. An arbitrator determined that the AWOL grievance was arbitrable. The agency filed exceptions to the arbitrator's determination, but FLRA ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to review those exceptions because &#x00A7; 7122(e) precluded the grievant from raising the AWOL charge in arbitration while he also pursued the removal case with MSPB:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency determined that the grievant was unfit for duty because he was intoxicated.&#x2003;Accordingly, he was sent home for the remainder of his work day and charged with 6 1/4 hours of AWOL.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the grievant returned to work the next day, he was presented with a proposed removal letter based on charges of intoxication on duty and AWOL. He responded to the proposed removal and filed a grievance over the AWOL charge. The Agency sustained the charges of intoxication on duty and AWOL and removed the grievant. The Agency also denied the grievance. The grievant appealed his removal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and the Union invoked arbitration of the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to a decision by the MSPB, the grievant and the Agency settled the removal action. Thereafter, the Arbitrator resolved the threshold issue of whether the grievance was arbitrable under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. He found that the grievance was arbitrable and <span id="page_1758"></span>that the MSPB appeal did not affect the arbitrability of the grievance because the settlement agreement did not resolve the grievant's AWOL dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to arbitration awards that relate to a matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute. The matters described in section 7121(f) are those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 and similar matters that arise under other personnel systems. The award in this case concerns one of the charges on which the Agency removed the grievant. Accordingly, although not raised by the parties, a jurisdictional issue is presented concerning whether the Arbitrator's award is an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The phrase "relating to" is not defined in the Statute. We have construed the phrase to encompass arbitration awards that resolve the section 4303 or 7512 action. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2986 and U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, The Adjutant General, State of Oregon</span>, 51 FLRA 1549, 1554 (1996) (<span class="Italic">AG, State</span> <span class="Italic">of Oregon</span>). We also have construed the phrase to permit the Authority to decline jurisdiction because an award is inextricably intertwined with a section 4303 or 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1555 (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Hines, Illinois and Illinois Nurses Association, Hines Local Unit</span>, 20 FLRA 510 (1985) and <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Bureau of the Census</span>, 976 F.2d 882 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In construing the phrase "relating to" in <span class="Italic">AG, State of</span> <span class="Italic">Oregon</span>, we examined the statutory scheme of section 7121(e) and section 7121(f) of the Statute. In addition, we were guided by the policy objectives of Congress in fashioning the scope of the Authority's jurisdiction. Pursuant to these provisions, arbitration awards and other administrative decisions are reviewed in the same appellate forum, which operates to ensure consistency and uniformity of process between arbitration and whatever appeal option is available to the affected employee. The statutory scheme also serves, again as Congress intended, to discourage forum shopping. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1554. We further noted that in delineating between awards that are reviewable by the Authority and those that are not, we are guided by the desirable policy objective of avoiding the multiplicity of litigation over one claim that might result if aspects of the same claim are reviewed in more than one forum. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AG, State of Oregon</span>, we drew a distinction between awards that resolve "pure" section 4303 or 7512 matters, over which the Authority clearly has no jurisdiction under section 7121(f), and awards resolving a broader range of matters, over which the Authority may decline jurisdiction, guided by the language of section 7122(a) and the policies reiterated above. In <span class="Italic">AG, State of Oregon</span>, there was no question that disputes over severance pay were not covered under section 4303 or 7512. The Authority also concluded that severance pay was not inextricably intertwined with the removal that provides the basis for that pay. In addition, we concluded that none of the policy objectives of Congress would be advanced by construing "relating to" broadly enough to encompass severance pay disputes. As no other forum had jurisdiction over the severance pay dispute, if we had declined jurisdiction the parties would have been deprived of review in a case where such a result was neither required by the Statute nor needed to further any discernible public policy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1555.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, AWOL is not a matter covered under section 4303 or 7512. <span class="Italic">E.g., Maki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 MSPR 449 (1989). Therefore, we are again not faced with a "pure" section 4303 or 7512 matter. In contrast to <span class="Italic">AG, State</span> <span class="Italic">of Oregon</span>, however, we conclude that the AWOL charge is inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal, a matter that is covered under section 7512. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 FLRA at 1555 (citing <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span> as an example of matters that became inextricably intertwined with a removal). Unlike severance pay, the MSPB or an arbitrator will examine the propriety of an AWOL charge in determining whether an employee was lawfully removed based on such a charge. Thus, the AWOL charge in this case simply cannot be separated from the ultimate determination to remove the employee. In addition, unlike <span class="Italic">AG, State of Oregon</span>, the assertion of jurisdiction in this case would encourage forum shopping and multiple litigation in future cases involving removals based on AWOL charges, which would create the possibility of inconsistent procedures or results in direct conflict with the policy objectives of Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that our refusal to assert jurisdiction may leave the Agency without a forum to challenge the Arbitrator's award. However, the Agency could have avoided this result by addressing the AWOL charge as part of the MSPB settlement agreement or by refusing to enter into the settlement agreement unless the Union agreed to waive its right to seek review of the Arbitrator's award. We acknowledge that there may be cases where no forum has jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award. In <span class="Italic">AG, State of Oregon</span>, we specifically interpreted section 7122(a) of the Statute in a manner to minimize cases of unreviewable awards. Nevertheless, we conclude that the advancement of the Congressional policies of uniformity, discouragement of forum shopping, and avoidance of multiple litigation, as well as the need for clarity and predictability on questions concerning jurisdiction, clearly override any potential for unreviewable awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statute precluding FLRA review of arbitration awards involving adverse actions extended to an award that determined that a grievance protesting an adverse action was procedurally barred by a provision of the contract excluding contract jurisdiction over those actions and left the MSPB as the adjudicator, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg</span>, 62 FLRA 503, 504 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in [&#x00A7;] 7121(f)" of the Statute. The matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) "are those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 and similar matters that arise under other personnel systems." <span class="Italic">United States Envtl. Prot. Agency, Narragansett, R.I.</span>, 59 FLRA 591, 592 (2004). The matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 include removals. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1013</span>, 60 FLRA 712, 713 (2005) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1013</span>). Arbitration awards resolving these matters are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(f) and 7703.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) "when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with," a &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin</span>., 57 FLRA 580, 581 (2001). In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, "but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one reviewable by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. BOP, Fed. Det. Ctr., Miami, Fla.,</span> 57 FLRA 677, 678 (2002). The Authority has found that arbitration awards resolving procedural issues regarding removal grievances are inextricably intertwined with removal matters. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Military Dist. of Wash., </span>35 FLRA 1272 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>) (award concerning compliance with procedural requirements of parties' CBA was directly connected and integral to removal grievance); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 171, </span>49 FLRA 1520, 1521 (1994) <span class="Italic">(AFGE) </span>(Authority lacked jurisdiction to review arbitration award because award was directly related to grievant's removal).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Authority has jurisdiction to review its exception because the arbitration award is not "inextricably intertwined" with the Union's removal grievance. Specifically, the Union claims that the Arbitrator decided only an issue regarding the procedural arbitrability of the grievance, which was severed from the removal grievance. However, as discussed above, the Authority has found such procedural matters to be inextricably intertwined with removal matters. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, </span>49 FLRA at 1521; <span class="Italic">Army, </span>35 FLRA 1275.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union cites <span class="Italic">Gettysburg</span>, 61 FLRA 849, to support its claim that the Authority has jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Gettysburg</span>, the Authority found that a grievance concerning the revocation of a grievant's law enforcement commission was not inextricably intertwined with a separate grievance involving the grievant's removal. Thus, in that case, there were multiple grievances, and the Authority exercised jurisdiction because the grievant's removal had been <span class="Italic">previously resolved</span> in a separate proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Gettysburg</span>, 61 FLRA at 852. By contrast, here, there is only one grievance, and it concerns whether the grievant can bring a removal action under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. Consequently, the resolution of the removal matter is dependent on the resolution of the issue before the Arbitrator and the two matters are inextricably intertwined<span class="Italic">. </span>As such, the exception is not within the Authority's jurisdiction and we dismiss the Union's exception on that ground.</p>
<p class="noindent">On a procedural note, as to objections to the manner that clarification is sought of a &#x00A7; 7121(f) award, FLRA is without jurisdiction. The matter must be pursued in court by either OPM or the union or appellant. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 22 FLRA 928, 932 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">That FLRA does not review exceptions to an award (whether it be an award on the merits, an award collateral to the merits issue, or a matter pertaining to the arbitrator's judgment on issues of compliance does not mean that FLRA lacks compliance authority through ULP procedures.
