<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-66"><span class="space">c.</span> Effect of Continuing Mental Disorder on Filing Deadline</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When an AJ determines the timeliness of a belated appeal that the agency seeks to have dismissed as untimely and that the appellant seeks to excuse as the result of a mental infirmity, the AJ is supposed to examine all the circumstances, including the fair implications of a physician's diagnosis, particularly the continuing nature of a mental disorder, <span class="Italic">Pyles v. MSPB</span>, 45 F.3d 411, 415-16 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documentary evidence that Pyles submitted was unrebutted. It concededly demonstrated that, at the time the OPM issued its reconsideration decision in March 1992, Pyles suffered dementia. While Dr. Daniel's letter expressly addressed the existence of increasingly severe dementia between January and July 1992, no evidence was placed in the record suggesting that Pyles' dementia was cured or had otherwise abated between July 1992 and November 1993. Moreover, in his November 1993 letter, Dr. Daniel's stated that Pyles "suffers" from "a degree of dementia," present in January 1992, that had "progressed" as of July 1992, suggesting that he thought Pyles still suffered dementia in November 1993 when he wrote his letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nature of dementia is such that, absent rebuttal evidence, one could not reasonably conclude that Pyles' condition simply improved with time. Both medical and English language dictionaries, of which we take judicial notice, indicate that the loss of intellectual faculties denominated "dementia" are due to progressive organic brain diseases....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Where, as here, a party is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature "permanent or progressive" in severity, it will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent rebuttal evidence of record to the contrary. Thus, the only finding the AJ could reasonably have made on this record is that Pyles suffered dementia from January 1992 to the time the appeal was filed. Nor could the AJ reasonably have discounted Dr. Daniel's conclusion that Pyles' dementia was so severe as to make her unable to handle legal and business affairs. There was simply no contrary evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's comment that Pyles' ability to sort and discard furniture established her mental ability to handle her legal affairs despite Dr. Daniel's express conclusion to the contrary is also unreasonable on its face. Similarly, the AJ's comment that Pyles and Michael's affidavit have "not explained her failure to have someone else file" is hardly logical. If Pyles could not understand her appeal options and her legal circumstances, how could she understand that she should ask someone else to file the appeal for her?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the AJ had held a hearing and received further evidence, a basis of his findings might have been provided. But on the documents submitted, by Pyles alone, there is no evidentiary basis for the AJ's analysis; instead, there is only a strained attempt to find in Pyles' submissions a basis for finding her competent to handle her own legal affairs in 1992-93. For example, his conclusion that Pyles' dementia "lasted only until July 1992" is based on an unreasonable reading of Dr. Daniel's letter. Similarly, the AJ takes individual events described in her son's affidavit, such as sorting through furniture, totally out of context and ignores the rest of what Michael Pyles swore to in order to support the assertion that Pyles "was able to manage her own personal affairs." For example, the AJ strains credulity past the breaking point when he relies on Pyles' move to Ohio as evidence of her competence when both Dr. Daniel and Michael swore, in unrebutted submissions, that the move was occasioned precisely by her <span class="Italic">lack</span> of competence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government, like the AJ, relies primarily on an analogy to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Sing v. Dept. of the Navy.</span> In <span class="Italic">Sing</span>, the petitioner offered a medical statement indicating that he suffered from major depressive episodes and multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome to show a good reason for the untimely filing of his appeal. 51 MSPR at 253. The Board dismissed his petition, reasoning that the submitted medical documents did not address the entire filing delay, and that any implied mental incapacity was belied by Sing's ongoing correspondence with the agency whose actions were contested in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 254. The case at bar, however, is hardly comparable to <span class="Italic">Sing.</span> First, fairly read, Dr. Daniel's unrebutted letter effectively covers the entire period of the delay. Second, depressive episodes are by definition temporary, treatable, and non-organic, while dementia is permanent, untreatable, and organic. Third, there is no evidence of record suggesting that Pyles kept in regular contact with the OPM while at the same time failing to timely appeal its adverse reconsideration decision. Fourth, her ability to choose which of her personal belongings to bring with her to Ohio cannot, despite the AJ's comment and the government's exhortations to the contrary, be analogized to Sing's ability to continue to negotiate a settlement agreement with the agency that fired him. The government's attempt to justify the AJ's refusal to waive Pyles' filing deadline on the basis of alleged factual similarity to <span class="Italic">Sing</span> is thus utterly unpersuasive. It is unfortunate that counsel for the Board apparently felt compelled to make so far-fetched an analogy. Nor can we accept counsel's assertion at oral argument that the Board's need to manage and limit its caseload somehow justifies the Board's refusal to find excusable delay here. The Board's standard on waiver of the deadline, whatever it is, must be applied consistently across cases; a waiver cannot be denied merely because the Board's docket may be increasing, as suggested by the Board's counsel at oral argument. Nor can our standard of what constitutes an abuse of discretion by the Board when it has denied a waiver.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The continuing nature of a mental disorder and the <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> analysis were noted in <span class="Italic">Dinkins v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 427, 430-31 (1996), excusing a belated appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party, "particularly [one] without the benefit of legal counsel, [is] not required to plead the issues with the precision required of an attorney in a judicial proceeding." <span class="Italic">Melnick v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 97 (1989) (citations omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). Here, although the appellant eventually obtained some help in filing his appeal and perhaps in responding to the timeliness order, his submissions and pre-hearing conference participation have been <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. The appellant's articulation of good cause for his delayed filing may have lacked precision, but he submitted evidence which shows that he has a permanent mental condition that prevented him from timely filing his appeal. Thus, as detailed below, we find good cause to waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant is diagnosed with a medical condition that, by its nature, is permanent or progressive, the condition will be presumed, absent other evidence, to continue after the date of diagnosis. <span class="Italic">Pyles v. MSPB</span>, 45 F.3d 411, 415 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The existence of such a condition during the time period for filing an appeal with the Board establishes good cause for an untimely filed appeal if it affects the appellant's ability to timely file. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 416.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not addressed by the administrative judge, the appellant's medical evidence shows that Green B. Neal, M.D., in a medical report and summary dated February 13, 1991, opined that the appellant met the Social Security Administration's disability guidelines based on his arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint, congestive heart failure, hypertensive vascular disease, organic mental disorders, anxiety-related disorder, and personality disorders. Dr. Neal, who had "followed" the appellant since October 29, 1981, stated that the appellant "has been totally disabled for longer than 1 year and his disabilities are permanent. There is no hope for resolving his problems with treatment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also did not address evidence showing that the appellant's mental disorders affected his ability to comply with <span id="Page_954"></span>deadlines. A June 11, 1991 decision by an administrative law judge with the Social Security Administration's Office of Hearings and Appeals found that the appellant's mental disorders, which were his primary disabling impairment, "often" caused deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace that resulted in a failure to complete tasks in a timely manner, in work settings or elsewhere. Colin C. Doyle, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist who evaluated and treated the appellant for several years, indicated that the appellant "is totally disabled due to chronic pain, depression [and] anxiety, hypertension and other physical problems."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Neal's finding that the appellant's disabilities were permanent is supported by: (1) Dr. Doyle's conclusion that, as of September 25, 1995, the appellant was totally disabled due to his depression, anxiety, and other medical problems; and (2) the appellant's continued receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Thus, in the absence of rebuttal evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the appellant's mental conditions continue to exist. <span class="Italic">See Pyles</span>, 45 F.3d at 415. Our finding that the appellant's disabling mental conditions existed during the filing period is consistent with the appellant's statement that concentrating on OPM's reconsideration decision was "too much for him at the time," and that "all the stress from all the physical and psychological therapy and this whole matter fell on [his] head at once in a big whirlwind of confusion and disappointment." <span class="Italic">Cf. Altman v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0752-94-0371-I-1, slip op. at 6 (Dec. 15, 1995) (the appellant's medical evidence of mental impairment was supported by his statement of being overwhelmed by feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression that caused his delay in seeking counsel and filing a timely appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing evidence, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the brief delay in filing his petition for appeal. OPM having made no showing of substantial prejudice as a result of the brief delay, we waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Terry v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 128, 130 &#x00B6; 5 (1999), added, regarding a documented mental disability, as the Board waived the delay in an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has represented himself throughout this appeal. On February 9, 1998, approximately one month prior to his removal, the DVA declared the appellant incompetent. The appellant also provided a letter from the medical facility treating him for his mental illness. This letter makes clear that the appellant's condition is permanent and that persistent or ongoing stress can decrease the effectiveness of the medications taken by the appellant to control his condition. Thus, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the late filing of his initial appeal, and we waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A federal district court returned a case to the Board for adjudication after a timeliness dismissal, with observations concerning proof of the appellant's mental disability, <span class="Italic">Alford v. Leonhart</span>, No. 7:14-CF-00196-F (EDNC 2016) [<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20160229973">https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20160229973</a>]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the MSPB dismissed Alford's claim based on untimeliness, it did not reach the merits of the case. Likewise, Defendants do not address the merits of Alford's complaint, but ask the court to dismiss it as untimely. Thus, the sole issue before the court is Alford's timeliness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a person who wishes to appeal an agency's decision must file the appeal with the MSPB within thirty (30) days of either the effective date of the agency's action or the date the appellant receives notification of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). Untimeliness may be excused, however, if "a good reason for the delay is shown." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). To establish good cause, "a party must show that he exercised diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case." <span class="Italic">Bond v. Dep't of Army</span>, No. DC07529110477, 1991 WL 249918, at *1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 20, 1991). The Board will consider "the length of the delay, the reasonableness of [the Petitioner's] excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition." <span class="Italic">Edwards v. US. Postal Serv</span>., No. DA-0752-98-0405-I-1, 2003 WL 21664189, at *2 (M.S.P.B. July 3, 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Moorman v.

Where a party claims that an illness prevented timely filing, he must: "(1) [i]dentify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time." <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Dep't of Navy</span>, No. SF-0752-97-0367-I-1, 1998 WL 300878, at *1 (M.S.P.B. June 2, 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Alford claims that her delay in filing is attributable to her mental illness during the applicable limitations period. In support of this claim, Alford presents the following: (1) Independent Psychological Evaluation, dated November 2, 2012, from Dr. Peter Schulz, a licensed psychotherapist[.], Alford also notes that she was homeless for at least a portion of the applicable limitations period, making it even more difficult for her to manage her affairs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon conducting his own examination of Alford and reviewing evaluations by other health professionals, Dr. Schulz concluded that Alford "appears to have suffered from a longstanding psychiatric condition that has rendered her unable to work and in need [of] outpatient therapy, monthly evaluations with a psychiatrist, and supportive help in the community with a social service agency's crisis team." Specifically, Dr. Schulz noted that Alford has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder--Recurrent, and Anxiety Disorder. Further, Dr. Schulz concluded that Alford's illness "would have rendered her unable...to have managed her financial planning and/or legal matters in a reliable or effective manner" in 1996, when she was terminated by the DEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the SSA decision, the ALJ provided a summary of Alford's psychiatric treatment and findings by mental health professionals. In particular, the ALJ noted that Alford was found to suffer from "constant depression, low energy, hopelessness, restricted affect, anxiety, passive suicidal ideation, thoughts of death directed toward her son, difficulty caring for herself, resulting in being disheveled, chest flutter, [and] headache[s]," and that she "has periods when she stays in the house 'all the time' and lies down." Ultimately, the ALJ concluded that "[Alford] has been disabled...since April 2, 2008, the date the application for supplemental security income was filed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reviewing this documentation, however, the MSPB concluded Alford had not adequately demonstrated that illness prevented her from filing her appeal. Specifically, the MSPB noted that "other than the disability award letter and 2012 psychological evaluation, the appellant provides no other medical evidence to support her claim of mental illness." In addition, the MSPB noted that "during the period of claimed incapacity, the appellant filed an application for disability retirement, pursued her appeal through OPM, and brought two appeals to the Board challenging OPM's determination." Given Alford's apparent ability to pursue other claims, the MSPB was dissatisfied by Alford's explanation of her inability to file the instant claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>[2] the record provided by the MSPB, the court concludes Alford was suffering from mental illness during the relevant time period. The court does not find, as the MSPB did, that Alford's ability to file other claims during the same time period necessarily implies that she was competent to manage her affairs. Rather, the court finds some successful filings on Alford's part may just as likely indicate only that Alford experienced brief periods of lucidity. Moreover, Alford's assertion that her mental illness left her "incapable of handling her affairs" is supported by Dr. Schulz' observation that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]hough [Alford] is a little confused if her ending date was 1996 or 2003, the matter is insignificant. Based on the information made available for the evaluation, it is clear that she has had a longstanding psychiatric condition that would have rendered her unable to have been able to have managed her financial planning and/or legal matters in a reliable or effective manner.... [H]er mental health condition at the time of her separation from employment with the Dept. of Justice would have rendered her incompetent to have known that she was supposed to have completed the necessary paperwork to be able to collect her retirement funds and/or benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In MSPB appeals, the court reviews discrimination claims <span class="Italic">de novo</span> and nondiscrimination claims under a deferential standard. <span class="Italic">Alguard</span>, 2015 WL 5008416, at *2. Alleging failure to accommodate a disability and retaliation, Alford appears to raise only discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the court concludes that the MSPB's timely filing requirement should be waived in Alford's case. Accordingly, the MSPB's decision is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for a decision on the merits....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generalized allegations of impairment, coupled with assertions of episodic mental impairment, did not excuse a belated appeal, <span class="Italic">Durr v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-15-0453-I-1 (NP 1/6/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded that he suffers from a "mental disability" and that his symptoms began to worsen in December 1995. He submitted a letter from a psychologist, dated December 14, 1995, indicating that he then was experiencing "an exacerbation of symptoms" and should be excused from work until January 19, 1996, at which time she would reevaluate his condition. He stated that he received the agency's decision notice on May 16, 1996, but then was undergoing psychiatric treatment and was not competent to understand the contents of the notice. He alleged that he had not "become legally inclined to understand the seriousness" of his removal, and the damage he suffered as a result of the agency's erroneous denial of his request for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 for the time period forming the basis of the AWOL charge, "until recently." He conceded that his appeal was untimely filed, but requested a waiver of the time limit based on the foregoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the written record, the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's appeal as untimely filed without good cause shown for the <span id="Page_955"></span>untimely filing. He found that the appellant should have filed his appeal no later than July 26, 1996, but did not do so until nearly 19 years after that deadline. As to the appellant's claim that he was unable to file his appeal "until recently," he noted that the appellant did not identify the specific date he became competent to file his appeal, or what steps he took to file his appeal once he was able to do so. He further found that the appellant did not show good cause for his filing delay because: (1) the delay was substantial; (2) the appellant failed to identify the basis for his alleged incompetency; (3) the medical documentation the appellant submitted did not support a finding that he was unable to timely file his appeal; and (4) the appellant failed to explain why he did not submit any medical documentation that would support his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review. He concedes that his appeal was untimely filed, but again argues that he is entitled to a waiver of the filing deadline due to his mental illness. The agency did not file a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained by the administrative judge, to establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, an appellant must: (1) identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; and (2) submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998). He also must demonstrate how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Lacy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 437 There is no general incapacitation requirement; rather, the appellant is required to explain only why his alleged illness impaired his ability to meet the Board's filing deadline or seek an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 437 n.*. However, a generalized claim of a medical problem without a specific explanation of how the problem prevented the appellant from meeting the filing deadline does not constitute good cause. <span class="Italic">Gross v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 334, &#x00B6; 11 (2006). Medical evidence proffered to establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness must address the entire period of the delay. <span class="Italic">Jerusalem v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 280 F. App'x 973 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish good cause for his filing delay. Below, the appellant did not identify the specific time period during which his mental illness prevented him from filing his appeal. Rather, he made the vague claim that he only had become competent to file "recently." On his initial appeal form, the appellant appeared to suggest that his mental disability is episodic. The December 1995 note from his psychologist only provides information as to his condition through January 19, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant only made a generalized assertion of incompetence. He did not identify his diagnosis or his symptoms, and also failed to provide any specific explanation as to how his illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or requesting an extension. <span class="Italic">See Jerusalem</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 6 (finding the appellant's assertion that he was not sufficiently competent to pursue his appeal, with no medical evidence as to how his medical condition impaired him from pursuing his appeal for more than 19 years, insufficient to establish good cause). We thus find that the appellant did not establish that his medical condition impaired his ability to file an appeal between the effective date of his removal in 1996 and the date he ultimately filed his appeal in 2015. Therefore, we affirm the initial decision.</p>

OPM</span>, AT-0831-15-0469-I-1 (NP 10/13/2016) ("Previously, the Board has found good cause where the appellant submitted medical evidence providing a detailed explanation of how her illness affected her ability to meet the filing deadline, including evidence that she was unable to understand, remember, and carry out very short, simple instructions; understand, remember, and carry out detailed instructions; perform activities within a schedule; be punctual within customary tolerances; and ask simple questions or request assistance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v.
