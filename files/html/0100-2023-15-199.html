<p class="Body-Text">The Board generally finds suspension appropriate for physical altercations not involving injury or weapons. <span class="Italic">Andrus v.

Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3190) (sustaining removal when "numerous severe facial lacerations" resulted; self-defense was not credited); <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 524, 527 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Andrus</span>); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313, 340 (1998) (agency overstated the harm resulting from an altercation between employees leading to the bruising of one employee against whom a door was closed; the incident was provoked to a degree by the injured employee who refused to leave an office when asked to do so). As to an employee who struck a female coworker after verbal abuse from the coworker, removal was reduced to a 60-day suspension. The employee had 19 years of service, a satisfactory work record, and no prior discipline. <span class="Italic">Grandison v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 301, 304, 7 MSPB 194 (1981). With provocation involving a racial slur toward the appellant, the penalty was reduced from removal to a 60-day suspension. <span id="Page_2701"></span>No weapons or serious injuries were involved; the appellant had 11 years of satisfactory service; there was no reference to a prior disciplinary record in the decision proposal or decision letters. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 524, 527 (1985) ("Although each case depends on its particular facts and circumstances, we have generally found a suspension to be appropriate in cases involving physical altercations which neither result in serious injury nor involve the use of weapons, when the employee has a history of satisfactory performance, when the agency does not rely on a prior disciplinary record in selecting the penalty, and when there is an element of provocation."); <span class="Italic">on referral from EEOC</span>, <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 623, 627 (1989) (sending to the Special Panel following disagreement with an EEOC finding of disparate treatment and discrimination); <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 609, 616 (Spec. Pan. 1990) (reporting the ultimate demise of the case because it grew so old that the agencies could no longer locate Mr. Wilburn). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Pace v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 259, 261 (1982) (removal sustained for assaulting and injuring a coworker; discounting evidence of racial tension in the appellant's work site).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was reduced to a 60-day suspension for an employee who struck a supervisor. The employee had 10 years of good service and he was provoked by the supervisor; his reaction was in apprehension of physical harm. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 476, 477 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Faucher v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 336, 339 (1989), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Randall v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 434, 439 (1981) (altercation with a supervisor; penalty reduced from removal to a 30-day suspension: the appellant had an unblemished work record of more than six years and she was suffering from extreme fatigue and nervousness that was aggravated by a recent change in shifts; her supervisor struck back and received only a reprimand; the agency did not consider the circumstances when it decided the penalty). <span class="Italic">Quinata v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 76, 79-80 (1991), mitigated to a 120-day suspension a removal based on striking and causing some injury to a supervisor. The appellant was harassed by the supervisor; the incident was provoked by the supervisor (although not by physical force); and the supervisor's injuries, although not inconsequential, were not severe.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vigil v. VA</span>, 46 MSPR 57, 60 (1990), mitigated a 60-day suspension to five days for an appellant whose physical reaction was provoked by a coworker's racial slur on his national origin and by the coworker grabbing his arm. There were no serious injuries and no weapons involved. The shorter suspension "should impress upon the appellant the need to restrain his temper in the face of provocative slurs, and to use only so much force as is necessary to free himself from another's unwanted grasp in the future." Long-standing provocation was an element that led the Federal Circuit to reverse the removal of an employee alleged to have assaulted another employee; the court dismissed as insubstantial the Board's finding that a bloody nose and bruises constituted serious injuries of the other employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Faucher v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 336, 339 (1989), <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">remand</span> <span class="Italic">from</span> 862 F.2d 322 (Fed.

USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 135, 142 (1990) (fighting: removal mitigated to a 60-day suspension; the agency did not prove the most serious charge of assault; provocation was involved in the altercation; there was a reasonable past service record). <span class="Italic">Andrus v. IRS</span>, 14 MSPR 500, 502-03, 13 MSPB 150 (1983), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, presents another example of mitigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted some Board decisions on physical altercations among coworkers, <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. USPS,</span> 328 Fed. Appx. 646 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the Board's decision in this case deviates from its standard practice of finding suspension the appropriate penalty in cases such as the present case. The Board has found mitigation of a removal to a suspension appropriate in a charge of physical assault on a co-worker where (1) no serious injury results; (2) no weapons are used; (3) the employee has a history of satisfactory performance; (4) the agency does not rely upon a prior disciplinary record in selecting the penalty; and (5) there is an element of provocation present. <span class="Italic">Faucher v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 41 M.S.P.R. 336, 339 (1989) (finding a 60-day suspension the maximum reasonable penalty when all five of these circumstances were present); <span class="Italic">see also Quinata v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 76 (1991) (removal mitigated to a 120-day suspension when the appellant was not the primary aggressor); <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 9 M.S.P.R. 468, 471 (1982) (removal mitigated to a 60-day suspension); and <span class="Italic">Grandison v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 7 M.S.P.R. 301, 304 (1981) (removal mitigated to a 60-day suspension). It appears from the record that all five of these circumstances are present in this case, and the Board has not held otherwise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lack of provocation may aggravate an offense to impose a penalty greater than would be suggested by a table of penalties, <span class="Italic">Cosen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 264 Fed. Appx. 897, 899-900 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Cosen stresses that this was his first and only employment misconduct and that he had a satisfactory work performance record. Mr. Cosen argues that the Board should have mitigated his removal to a 60-day suspension at most, for the conditions are comparable to those of <span class="Italic">Faucher v. United States Postal Service</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 336 (1989), where the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has found that mitigation of a removal to a 60-day suspension may be appropriate in a charge of physical assault on a co-worker where (1) no serious injury results; (2) no weapons are used; (3) the employee has a history of satisfactory performance; (4) the agency does not rely upon a prior disciplinary record in selecting the penalty; and (5) there is an element of provocation present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 339 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army argues that unlike the employee in <span class="Italic">Faucher</span>, Mr. Cosen was the aggressor and there was no element of provocation. The Army states that <span class="Italic">Faucher</span> leaves room for agency discretion, and that the agency has discretion to exceed its Table of Penalties, in its sole judgment. The Army argues that the Board, and especially the court, should defer to the agency's choice of disciplinary action. The AJ referred to the testimony of from Mr. Donald Police, Director of Law Enforcement Security at the Pine Bluff Arsenal, who stressed that Mr. Cosen's position was that of Security Guard, and that this violent action, although brief and without causing injury, had permanently undermined the agency's confidence in his ability to exercise sound judgment and control in emergency situations. Mr. Police pointed out that Mr. Cosen was well aware of the agency's zero-tolerance policy against workplace violence, and that all employees had received a memorandum notice stating that "removal for a first offense" is possible for a violent offense or a threat of violence at the workplace. Mr. Police testified that removal is consistent with the agency's penalties imposed for similar offenses, even if the Table of Penalties was exceeded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ acknowledged Mr. Cosen's "positive past performance, his apology and the isolated nature of his misconduct," but nevertheless found that "the seriousness of his misconduct militates against mitigation." The AJ concluded that separation from the service was warranted in light particularly of the agency's zero-tolerance policy and the special responsibilities of security guards in emergency situations. Recognizing that the Table of Penalties was exceeded, the Board sustained the discretion of the agency in employment decisions that depend on particular facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 772 F.2d 887 (Fed. Cir. 1985) this court analyzed its deferential role in reviewing an employing agency's choice of penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[T]he court will not disturb a penalty unless it exceeds the range of permissible punishment or is "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." Penalty decisions are judgment calls best left to the discretion of the employing agency. The presumption is that government officials have acted in good faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 889 (citations omitted). The penalty imposed on Mr. Cosen on its face "exceeds the range of punishment stated, in the agency's Table of Penalties." When the agency has exceeded the maximum penalty in its Table of Penalties, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate supportable reason for exceeding that maximum. The agency met that burden in the testimony of Mr. Police concerning the requirements of the position of Security Guard at the Arsenal, and the evidence upon which the AJ found that the attack was unprovoked. We conclude that the Board's decision must be sustained.</p>

VA</span>, PH-0752-12-0443-I-2 (NP 2/3/2014) ("Although some of our decisions note that under certain circumstances the maximum reasonable penalty for a first-time offense of fighting in the workplace is a prolonged suspension, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Faucher v.

USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 420, 423 (1982) (mitigation from removal to suspension as a result of a violent conflict between two workers: the appellant had a long, excellent work record; there was an element of provocation; the other employee had a reputation for verbal threats and physical assaults; and the appellant could not have, under the circumstances, backed off or sought assistance to end the confrontation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Colon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 202-04 (1993) (involving separate opinions by Member Parks and Chairman Levinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part), the Board was confronted with an appeal challenging the removal of a female employee who was charged with "disorderly conduct" by the agency after allegedly "causing bodily injury to her supervisor by throwing objects, punching him with her fists, hitting him with a 'bat' and brandishing a knife." The appellant's defense included an assertion that she was a disabled employee suffering post-traumatic stress disorder and that her actions were provoked by the supervisor's sexual harassment. The appellant was not a qualified disabled employee because there was insufficient evidence that she had committed herself to an ongoing treatment program necessary for her treatment and rehabilitation. The Board determined in its majority opinion that mitigation of the penalty to a 180-day suspension was in order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant repeats the arguments she presented below: That the agency is strictly liable for the <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment inflicted <span id="Page_2702"></span>by its supervisor, and that but for that illegal harassment her misconduct would not have occurred, so that the agency's action in removing her based on her reaction to his harassment constitutes sexual discrimination. As the administrative judge correctly explained, however, the issue is not whether the appellant has a cause of action against the agency based on sexual harassment, but whether the agency's action for <span class="Italic">her</span> misconduct was a pretext for sexual discrimination. As he further explained, the removal action itself was not taken because of the appellant's sex or in retaliation for her refusal to submit to her supervisor's advances. As the agency states in its response, the appellant has cited no authority, and we have found none, for her theory that a sexually harassed employee is not responsible for her own independent acts of misconduct perpetrated in conjunction with or in response to sexual harassment by another employee. We find no error in the administrative judge's analysis of this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's conclusion that the penalty of removal would be unreasonable even if the disorderly conduct charge were sustained, and even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, was based in part on his finding that the appellant's conduct on August 14 had been provoked by her second-line supervisor's sexual harassment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "qualified handicapped employee penalty mitigation" analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 75 (1987), was clarified in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 51 MSPR at 49-50. As the Board there explained, the fact that an employee's misconduct is found to be so egregious as to disqualify him from his position does not necessarily require that the employee be removed from Federal service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 49. Under all of the circumstances of this case, the penalty of removal exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. The appellant had over 11 years of satisfactory and above-satisfactory service, with no prior disciplinary actions. Moreover, the "extremely serious form of provocation" in this case, cannot be minimized. The administrative judge specifically found that the appellant's conduct "was the product of a mental disorder, triggered by the sexual harassment and other manipulations [with regard to the alleged "under the influence" incident] of an agency supervisor." The administrative judge also credited the testimony of the appellant's experts, to the effect that, "without this provocation, the incident probably never would have occurred."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981), "mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter" are relevant factors regarding the severity of the penalty meted out by the agency. In this case, we find that the agency failed to accord sufficient weight to these mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Balanced against the strong mitigating circumstances, is the seriousness of the offense itself. By her conduct, the appellant inflicted substantial bodily injury upon the Foreman. As the administrative judge correctly stated, "any physical attack on a supervisor in the work place is serious, because it strikes at the very core of an orderly and discipline [sic] work environment...." The appellant's action, therefore, mandates a significant penalty. Under all of the circumstances, a 180-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty that may be imposed in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cochran v. Department of Justice</span>, 16 MSPR 343, 353 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Colon</span> was unusual. <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. United States</span>, 144 Ct. Cl. 689 (1959), sustained removal of a postal worker who slapped his supervisor after the supervisor used a racial epithet to address the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then is whether the slapping incident constituted reasonable cause for his removal. This question can only be answered in the affirmative. While we do not condone the use of the language complained of, we do believe that it furnished no excuse for violence. Certainly not only the Post Office Department but the nation would be in a chaotic condition if every person was permitted to take any violent steps be deemed necessary to assuage his feelings for an insulting remark. Our daily lives are controlled by laws which are not made for frivolous reasons, and are not made to be broken. Plaintiff did commit an act which constituted a breach of law, and it is for the Post Office officials to determine whether the action was reasonable cause for removal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has both a right and a responsibility to maintain discipline and order among its employees....&#8197;The infliction of bodily harm affects the agency's obligation to maintain a safe workplace, and by its very nature, is disruptive to the efficiency of the service....&#8197;Given the nature of the appellant's offenses, a significant penalty must be imposed to impress upon her the seriousness of her actions and to promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency's deciding official that the appellant's actions, disrespect for authority and violation of good, sensible safety practices cannot be condoned. In his deposition, the deciding official stated that he considered various <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including the morale of the base populace and working sections, and that three of the appellant's supervisors indicated that they "fear for their safety." The agency, however, presented no direct or specific evidence, in the form of affidavits or other statements, that the appellant's actions affected the morale of any co-employee or her superiors. Moreover, the appellant's immediate supervisor testified that he would be willing to continue to work with the appellant and to accept her as an employee. On further cross-examination, when asked if he would be happy to have the appellant back, he responded affirmatively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had approximately 21 years of satisfactory service and no prior disciplinary record. Further, the offenses occurred on the same day and arose out of one continuing situation; the agency did not prove that the appellant acted willfully in causing the injury; the bruise to the security officer was relatively minor; and no criminal charges or traffic citations were issued for the appellant's conduct. In addition, the agency has not established that the proven charges had an effect upon the appellant's ability to perform her duties at a satisfactory level or that the offenses would undermine the capacity of the agency to maintain employee efficiency and discipline.</p>
