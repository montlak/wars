<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-156"><span class="space">b.</span> Weight Control, Fitness</h5>
<p class="noindent">Employees in civilian positions that depend on maintenance of military status may find themselves in jeopardy of losing their civilian jobs should their military positions be lost through failure to comply with weight control or fitness programs. Proposals requiring agencies to grant duty time for employees to participate in physical fitness activities directly interfere with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 251, Forest Serv. Council and USDA, Forest Serv., Region 10</span>, 49 FLRA 1070, 1071-72 (1994). In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2077 and DOD, Michigan Air Nat'l Guard, 127th Tactical Fighter Wing</span>, 43 FLRA 344, 349-63 (1991), FLRA took pains to explain the partial nonnegotiability of Proposal 1, requiring the employer to notify an employee of risks to his employment by failure to comply with a weight control program and requiring the employer to permit the employee up to three hours a week of paid time to exercise. The notice provision was negotiable, but not the provision for paid exercise time. FLRA began its discussion by explaining why the proposals, essentially involving the effects of military weight control requirements, were within the ambit of "conditions of employment":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute defines the term "conditions of employment," with certain statutory exclusions, as "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions[.]" In deciding whether a proposal involves a condition of employment, the Authority considers whether (1) the proposal pertains to unit employees; and (2) the record establishes a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees. <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association and Antilles Consolidated School System</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 237 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Antilles</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not addressed whether proposals relating to military <span id="page_725"></span>aspects of ART [Air Reserve Technicians] employment involve conditions of employment under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has addressed this issue with regard to the military aspects of civilian technician employment in the National Guard, however. The Authority consistently has held that matters related solely to such aspects do not concern conditions of employment under the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Teachers, Pennsylvania State Council and The Adjutant General, Department of Military Affairs, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</span>, 3 FLRA 50, 55 (1980) (proposal enabling technician to appeal military rating held to concern a matter that was specifically provided for by law and, as result, not a condition of employment because technician's military employment "is totally mandated by law.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1623 and South Caroline [sic]</span> <span class="Italic"> National Guard, Columbia, South Carolina</span>, 28 FLRA 633, 641-43 (1987) (<span class="Italic">South Carolina National Guard</span>), for example, the Authority addressed a proposal establishing certain procedural requirements applicable where changes in a National Guard technician's military status affected the technician's civilian job. Among other things, the proposal would have: (1) required the civilian personnel office to take certain actions if a technician faced separation from his/her civilian position because of position incompatibility; and (2) enabled such a technician to file an informal appeal prior to separation. The Authority held that as the proposal concerned "a matter in connection with the military aspects of technician employment," it did not concern a condition of employment under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 643.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">South Carolina National Guard</span> was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1623 v. FLRA</span>, 852 F.2d 1349 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">NFFE v. FLRA</span>). The court noted that, under the National Guard Technician Act, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, "the entire question of compatibility is a <span class="Italic">military</span> issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352 (emphasis in original). The court held that compatibility between military and civilian positions was a "matter" specifically provided for by Federal statute and therefore not a bargainable condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The combined effect of the [Statute] and the Technicians Act is to give National Guard technicians a limited right to negotiate over conditions of employment: But that right is circumscribed by the reality that a technician's military status will often impinge on his civilian status and that, when this happens, the needs of the military must prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1353....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the foregoing that proposals relating to military aspects of National Guard Technician employment do not concern conditions of employment under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike National Guard Technician employment, ART employment was not established by statute. Instead, "[t]he ART program was created as a result of a 1957 Memorandum of Agreement, implemented in 1958, between the Air Force and the Civil Service Commission, now the Office of Personnel Management. <span class="Italic">Ridgway v. Aldrige</span>, 709 F. Supp. 265, 267 (D. Mass. 1989). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Hoffman</span>, 543 F.2d 930, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1976)... There is no indication that, since its inception, the ART employment program has been statutorily enacted<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8848(c)(2) (authorizing Secretary of the Air Force to retain reserve officers who occupy civilian ART positions in active service beyond the mandatory retirement date established in 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8848(a)). Accordingly, there is no basis on which to hold, generally, that matters relating to ART employment are specifically provided for by statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we are mindful of the court's statement in <span class="Italic">NFFE v. FLRA</span> that "the military enjoys special status, and its decisions involving the organization of security forces are especially shielded from outside interference." 852 F.2d at 1353. Indeed, the "complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments[.]" <span class="Italic">Chappell v. Wallace</span>, 462 U.S. 296, 302 (1983). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Glines</span>, 444 U.S. 348, 354 (1980) ("The military is, 'by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian society.'") (citation omitted). In addition, members of the uniformed services are not "employees," for purposes of the Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(B)(ii), and, as noted previously, n.1, it is unlawful for a person to bargain on behalf of members of the armed forces over terms or conditions of military service. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we conclude that, even though ART employment is not specifically provided for by statute, a union may not bargain directly over purely military aspects of ART employment. That is, under section 7103(a)(14), conditions of employment do not include personnel policies, practices, and matters that relate only to the military service of an ART. Accordingly, a union proposal relating to, for example, the content of a policy applicable to ARTs only in their military capacities, will not be found to concern a condition of employment under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot ignore, however, the civilian aspects of ART employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As with non-ART employees, [ARTs'] duties and responsibilities during the working day are governed by the civil service laws and regulations. Promotions, RIFS, etc. are subject to civil service procedures. When working in their civilian capacities, the technicians do not wear military uniforms and are not required to follow the rules of "military courtesy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Resor</span>, 387 F. Supp. 63, 71 (D.D.C. 1974) (footnote omitted)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 70 ("When operating within the confines of the civil service laws the military departments, as other components of the executive branch, must abide by the definitional requirements of Title 5[.]"). Accordingly, insofar as the application of a military policy affects ARTs in their civilian capacities, a proposal relating to such effects may be found, consistent with the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, to concern a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 has three requirements.&#x2003;Section 1 requires the Agency to: (1) notify employees who are not in compliance with AFR 35-11 and afford them a reasonable period of time in which to achieve compliance; and (2) advise employees of the administrative consequences of continued noncompliance. Section 2 requires the Agency to provide affected employees an opportunity to use duty time to engage in physical exercise necessary to comply with the regulation. We will address the requirements separately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1, the first sentence, requires the Agency to inform employees who are not in compliance with the fitness and weight requirements in AFR 35-11 of such noncompliance and afford them a reasonable period of time to comply....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, the record before us indicates that AFR 35-11 applies to ARTs in their military capacities only. It follows that determinations regarding compliance with the regulation, including the period of time that ARTs are given to comply, also apply to ARTs in their military capacities only. As such, we are compelled to conclude that section 1, the first sentence, addresses purely military aspects of ARTs' employment. Based on this conclusion, we conclude further that this sentence does not concern conditions of employment, within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute. Therefore, without addressing the Agency's other arguments regarding this sentence, we conclude that it is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1, the second sentence, requires the Agency to advise employees of the "administrative consequences" of continued noncompliance with the requirements of AFR 35-11. The proposal does not define "administrative consequences." Based on the record as a whole, however, and in the absence of an assertion to the contrary, we interpret the proposal as requiring the Agency to notify employees who are not in compliance with AFR 35-11 of the consequences of such noncompliance to their civilian employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the second sentence of section 1 relates to the content of AFR 35-11 or to the application of the regulation to ARTs in their military capacities. Moreover, the sentence clearly pertains to unit employees, as required by the first <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test. In addition, by addressing the "consequences" of noncompliance on civilian employment, we conclude that the proposal satisfies the second test in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>. That is, the wording of the sentence itself establishes the relationship between the proposal and the working conditions of unit employees. Accordingly, we conclude that section 1, the second sentence, concerns conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2 of Proposal 1 requires the Agency to provide affected unit employees an opportunity to use duty time "to engage in physical exercise" to assist employees in complying with AFR 35-11. Section 2 addresses, by its terms, employees' use of duty time, without loss of pay, for certain activities. As such, and as the proposal pertains to unit employees, it involves conditions of employment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 1, the second sentence</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals requiring an agency to provide information to unit employees are negotiable provided the information concerns conditions of employment and is disclosable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that section 1, the second sentence, does not violate 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2).... [T]his statutory provision prohibits bargaining on behalf of members of the armed services over conditions of military service. Here, the Union, as representative of civilian employees, seeks to bargain over a provision requiring the Agency to notify such employees of aspects of their civilian employment. As such, and as nothing in this portion of section 1 would require bargaining over AFR 35-11 itself or the application of the regulation to ARTs in their military capacities, we find that the proposal does not violate 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no assertion, or other basis on which to conclude, that the information required by section 1, the second sentence, is not disclosable or that the sentence is otherwise nonnegotiable. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentence is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_726"></span>b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sections 2 and 3</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2 provides that employees who have been advised that they will be reassigned, downgraded, suspended, or removed unless they meet the fitness and weight limitations contained in AFR 35-11 will be afforded an opportunity "to use duty time to engage in physical exercise that will assist the employee[s] in meeting the employer's requirements." Section 3 provides that if the Agency determines that continued use of the duty time provided in section 2 "results in an untenable hardship on performance of the employer's work," the amount of time "is appropriate for renegotiation with [the Union]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Union also states that although section 2 does not "state an amount of time[,] in bargaining, the intended time was discussed as being up to 3 hours per week."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the wording of sections 2 and 3 and the Union's other statements of intent, we construe section 2 as requiring the Agency to grant affected employees' requests for duty time, up to 3 hours each week, to engage in physical exercise to meet the weight and fitness requirements of AFR 35-11. We construe section 3 as providing for renegotiation of the amount of duty time provided by section 2 in situations where use of that time resulted in an "untenable hardship on performance of the employer's work." We will determine the negotiability of sections 2 and 3 in that context.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that sections 2 and 3 violate 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c).... Like section 1 (the second sentence), sections 2 and 3 constitute the Union's proposals, as exclusive representative of civilian employees, to negotiate with the Agency, as civilian employer, over unit employees' civilian conditions of employment. Nothing in sections 2 and 3 would affect the content of AFR 35-11 or its application to ARTs in their military capacities. Therefore, we find no inconsistency between sections 2 and 3 and 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that sections 2 and 3 interfere with its right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. We agree. Proposals requiring an agency to permit employees to use duty time for physical fitness activities directly interfere with the agency's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although sections 2 and 3 directly interfere with the Agency's right under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, these sections are negotiable if they constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 states that it is "an appropriate arrangement for employees affected by the management requirement that...employees maintain their physical condition...." The Union confirms that the proposal is intended to mitigate the effects on employees of such requirements. We conclude, therefore, that sections 2 and 3 are intended as arrangements for adversely affected employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal excessively interferes with management's rights, the Authority balances the competing practical needs of employees and managers as they are affected by the proposal. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 24 FLRA at 31-32. In <span class="Italic">Washington National Guard</span> [38 FLRA 295 (1990)] and <span class="Italic">California National Guard</span> [37 FLRA 462 (1990)], the Authority concluded that proposals providing unit employees with up to 3 hours of duty time each week for physical fitness activities excessively interfered with the agencies' right to assign work. We reach the same conclusion here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">California National Guard</span>, the disputed proposal provided each unit employee with 3 hours of duty time each week for physical fitness activities. 37 FLRA at 462. In concluding that the proposal excessively interfered with the agency's right to assign work, the Authority noted that the National Guard technicians involved in that case were required to meet certain physical fitness requirements as a condition of retaining their civilian technician positions and that failure to meet those requirements could result in separation from such positions. The Authority held, however, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The benefit to employees of having duty time to engage in physical fitness activities is of relatively limited significance when compared to the significant burden on the [a]gency. Because the potentially adverse effects may arise only in limited circumstances as to particular employees and are not inevitable, it is excessively burdensome to require the [a]gency to provide 3 hours of duty time each week for every unit employee to engage in physical fitness activities. Further, the proposal does not allow exceptions. Thus, the [a]gency would be prevented from denying technicians duty time for physical fitness activities, for example, to respond to staffing shortages.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 467.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Washington National Guard</span>, the disputed proposal would have established a physical fitness program on duty time. As relevant here, the proposal provided that "[n]o more than three (3) hours of official time per week may be used for [the] program." 38 FLRA at 300. In finding that the proposal excessively interfered with the agency's right to assign work, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The proposal in this case is to the same effect as the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">California National Guard</span>. Although the proposal in this case is more detailed and provides management with more flexibility in determining when an employee will participate in physical fitness activities, the result is the same: for up to 3 hours each week the [a]gency would be precluded from assigning work to any technician who participated in the program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 302. Noting that the proposal enabled agency supervisors to control the use of duty time but did not allow them to deny requests altogether, the Authority concluded that the disputed proposal's benefits to employees did not outweigh "the significant limitations on management's ability to assign work." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 303.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal now before us differs from those in <span class="Italic">California National Guard</span> and <span class="Italic">Washington National Guard</span>. Unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">California National Guard</span>, the proposal does not provide a set amount of duty time for physical fitness activities. Instead, as discussed above, section 2 provides for "up to 3 hours per week." Moreover, unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">Washington National Guard</span>, section 2 does not apply to all unit employees who choose to participate in a physical fitness program. Section 2 applies only to unit employees who are subject to "reassignment, downgrade, suspension, or removal" for failure to comply with fitness and weight requirements....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, sections 2 and 3 are similar to the disputed proposals in <span class="Italic">California National Guard</span> and <span class="Italic">Washington National Guard</span> in other respects. Like the proposals in those cases, section 2 would require the Agency to grant employee requests for duty time. Although sections 2 and 3 would not appear to limit the Agency's ability to schedule the use of duty time, the Agency could not deny the use of such time, even for mission-related reasons. Indeed, renegotiation of the amount of such duty time available under section 2 is provided, under section 3, only when the use of that time results in "an untenable hardship on performance of the employer's work[.]" Moreover, although section 2 would provide "up to" 3 hours of duty time, the amount of time granted within that cap would be determined by the affected employee, not the Agency. Put simply, provided an employee requested no more than 3 hours per week, the Agency would be required to grant the request, even if such factors as work requirements or staffing shortages dictated against release of the affected employee for physical fitness activities, unless the parties renegotiated the duty time entitlement under section 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 2 and 3 could provide considerable benefits to affected unit employees.&#x2003;The sections also could have a significant impact on the Agency's right to assign work. On balance, we conclude that the impact of sections 2 and 3 on the Agency's right outweighs the benefits to employees and, therefore, these sections excessively interfere with the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. Accordingly, without addressing the Agency's argument that the sections also interfere with its right to determine the personnel by which Agency operations are conducted, we conclude that sections 2 and 3 are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Administrative leave, granted at the discretion of the supervisor for participation in the "Customs Health Enhancement Program" for up to three hours per week, was negotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1177-78 (1999) (Provision 2). The proposal infringed neither management's right to assign work nor Comptroller General decisions interpreting administrative leave requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 provides that administrative leave will be granted with supervisory approval.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2119 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Rock Island Arsenal, Rock</span> <span class="Italic">Island, Illinois, </span>49 FLRA 151 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Rock Island), the</span> Authority found that a proposal that required supervisory approval for the use of administrative leave did not affect management's rights. The Authority explained that because the proposal preserved the Agency's right to approve the use of administrative leave, there was no effect on the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 161. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1429</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Army, Letterkenny, Army</span> <span class="Italic">Depot, </span>23 FLRA 117, 119 (1986) <span class="Italic">(Department of the Army</span>) (provision permitting the Agency to deny administrative leave when the "time...would interfere with the Agency's work" did not affect management's right to assign work). Like the proposal in <span class="Italic">Rock Island, </span>Provision 2 preserves the Agency's right to approve the use of administrative leave. In addition, Provision 2 specifically provides that administrative leave will be granted only when "workload permits."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the undisputed meaning of Provision 2, and consistent with <span class="Italic">Rock Island and Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, </span>we find that Provision 2 does not affect management's right to assign work because it would provide administrative leave only with a supervisory determination that the grant of leave would not interfere with workload demands. Because we find <span id="page_727"></span>that the provision does not affect management's rights, it is not necessary to examine the Union's assertions that the provision is a procedure or an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Provision 2 is Not Contrary to Comptroller General Precedent or Section 7901</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's assertion, the Comptroller General did not hold in 67 Comp. Gen. 126 that agencies may grant brief periods of administrative leave only for humanitarian purposes. The Comptroller General held that a humanitarian purpose is one basis upon which agencies may grant administrative leave. Moreover, although the Comptroller General previously held that an agency could not grant 3 hours per week of administrative leave for physical fitness, <span class="Italic">see </span>64 Comp. Gen. 835 (1985), the Comptroller General concluded in 70 Comp. Gen. 190 that it would no longer follow that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Authority has specifically held that "there [is] no basis in either the F[ederal] P[ersonnel] M[anual] or Comptroller General decisions interpreting the FPM provisions to limit the ability of agencies to determine the appropriate uses of administrative leave." <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Asheville, North Carolina, </span>51 FLRA 1572, 1579 n.10 (1996) <span class="Italic">(VAMC, Asheville). </span>The Authority also held that agencies have discretion to grant administrative leave for brief periods, and that "management can negotiate over how it will exercise that discretion<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1578.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we reject the Agency's argument that, under Comptroller General precedent, it lacks discretion to approve the administrative leave required by Provision 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that the provision is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901.... The Authority held <span class="Italic">in National Association of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local R1-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut, </span>47 FLRA 651, 656 (1993) <span class="Italic">(VAMC, Newington) </span>that, under section 7901, "agencies may grant excused absence for participation in officially authorized programs for disease prevention and for promoting and maintaining health and fitness.... Absences of this nature are termed 'administrative leave' and may be granted in the discretion of each agency[.]" The Agency has provided no basis for concluding that administrative leave for physical fitness is contrary to law. Consistent with <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington,</span> we find that Provision 2 is not contrary to section 7901.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf. DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 62 FLRA 416 (2008) (sustaining arbitrator's award directing agency to make fitness program for certain personnel, in place at other agency facilities, available to employees at particular facility).
