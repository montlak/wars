<p class="Body-Text">Reassignments and transfers are covered personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Marano v. DOJ</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 631, 641 &#x00B6; 19 (2000) (reassignment); <span class="Italic">Paul v. USDA</span>, 66 MSPR 643, 650 (1995) (reassignment is a covered personnel action under the WPA); <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dept. of Army</span>, 92 MSPR 572, 578 &#x00B6; 14 (2002) (reassignment was covered even if the appellant recommended the abolition of his own position in a RIF; the appellant's suggestion must be considered under of the facts of the case). A voluntary reassignment does not constitute a "personnel action" under section 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Key v. SSA</span>, AT-1221-12-0106-B-2 (NP 9/25/2015); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Patrolmen's Benevolent Ass'n. v. City of New York</span>, 310 F.3d 43, 51 (2nd Cir. 2002) (Title VII civil rights action: "A lateral transfer that does not result in a reduction in pay or benefits may be an adverse employment action so long as the transfer alters the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment in a materially negative way.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reassignment is a covered personnel practice even if it does not result in a diminution of status or loss of potential future pay increases, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 627-28 n.4, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant describes her reassignment as a "constructive demotion," on the theory that she entered the settlement agreement of her EEO claim without knowing that she would be reassigned to a nonsupervisory position with a lower pay cap. However, neither a reduction in responsibility, nor a possible loss of future pay, constitutes an appealable demotion, constructive or otherwise. <span class="Italic">McEnery v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 963 F.2d 1512, 1514-15 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The constructive demotion doctrine is limited to cases in which the employee: (1) was reassigned from a position which, due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of a classification error, was worth a higher grade; (2) met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade; and (3) was permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which she would otherwise have been promoted. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 711 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Hogan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 218 F.3d. 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000). These elements are not present here. Nonetheless, a reassignment is a personnel action for purposes of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may challenge a claim that reassignment occurs as a result of some modification of either duties or the position description. The Board looks to the entire transaction, <span class="Italic">Onasch v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 158, 162-63 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review that the change in her <span id="Page_3903"></span>position description and duties was a reassignment and refers to an August 16, 1993 SF-50, included in the record below, documenting the reassignment. She maintains that the SF-50 memorializes what took place earlier when the new branches were created and her duties were changed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reassignment is defined at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12) as a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency, from one position to another, without promotion or demotion. The SF-50 indicates that the position title, grade level, and salary are identical. The only change shown is in the position description code number. Both position descriptions include supervising and performing contract work, but the new position description does not include supervision of small purchasing and reduces the number of employees supervised from eleven to two. We note that the record contains a memorandum from Ron Barrett, who appears to be an agency personnelist, expressing some concern over a proposed position description for the appellant and the newly added Supervisory Contract Specialist and stating, "these two positions may not be able to maintain a supervisory title under present classification criteria...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, contrary to the administrative judge, that the agency's actions constitute a reassignment, thus satisfying the jurisdictional requirement of a personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). First, the record shows that the agency considered the action to be a reassignment. As the source of authority for the personnel action, the agency cited 5 CFR &#x00A7; 335.102 which authorizes agencies to promote, demote, and reassign employees. Moreover, the loss of responsibility for small purchasing and the significant reduction in the number of persons supervised show that the change went further than a revision of the position description....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shivaee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 383, 388 (1997), decided that an allegation that the appellant's duty site was changed did not, without further elaboration, constitute a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions inconsistent with the appellant's grade or salary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an employee be removed for declining an improperly ordered geographical reassignment, or should an employee be removed for problems resulting from the improperly ordered reassignment, corrective action may include reinstatement of the employee and restoration of the employee to the position held before the reassignment. One issue may be whether the agency should have anticipated the collateral problems associated with the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 71 MSPR 661, 664-66 (1996), a corrective action case, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a corrective action proceeding filed pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B), it is left to the Board's discretion to determine the appropriate remedy<span class="Italic">. Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 62 MSPR 26, 29 (1994); 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(B)(i). Therefore, if the Board decides that it would be appropriate to cancel the proposed removal in this case, it may do so even though it does not reach the question of whether the removal, standing alone, would itself be a prohibited personnel practice<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the ALJ that the question of whether it would be appropriate to reverse the pending removal action turns on the connectedness of the removal and the reassignment. The ALJ's reliance on a proximate cause analysis rooted in tort law to determine the connectedness of the two agency actions was also not an error. Therefore, if a direct interrelation is shown between the impermissible action and the subsequent action, then the appropriate remedy would include reversing the second action. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Transp.</span>, 62 MSPR at 29. The ALJ correctly states that in order to find proximate cause between the reassignment and the subsequently charged misconduct, we would also have to find that the agency could have foreseen or reasonably anticipated Mr. Armstrong's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the reassignment and the subsequently charged misconduct (absence without leave, failure to follow leave procedures, and insubordination for failure to report), which resulted in the proposed removal action, are sufficiently connected to support a finding that the reassignment was the proximate cause of the agency's decision to remove Mr. Armstrong. Following the agency's decision to reassign Mr. Armstrong, he notified the agency that he would have to decline the reassignment because of his family responsibilities. Prior to relocating, Mr. Armstrong informed the agency that his parents and his wife's parents were all dependent on him for daily assistance. Additionally, he stated that his wife was in poor health, and he was involved in two business deals worth over $200,000.00. Nevertheless, the agency proceeded with the reassignment of Mr. Armstrong as of July 12, 1992, which was a prohibited personnel practice, as the ALJ correctly found.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, Mr. Armstrong requested and received an extension of his reporting date to August 23, 1992. He did then report for duty in Ohio in August of 1992. However, he was absent from work from April 26, 1993, through June 15, 1993, because of his wife's illness and his mother-in-law's illness and subsequent death, among other reasons. We find it significant that Mr. Armstrong's wife's health and his in-laws' reliance on his assistance were specific reasons he gave the agency for declining the reassignment prior to that action being effected. Since the agency was made aware of the potential problems that would result from reassigning Mr. Armstrong, its argument that it could not foresee the predicted result is therefore unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJ correctly ruled that Mr. Armstrong's use of annual leave was foreseeable, and therefore should be restored upon canceling the reassignment. However, the ALJ erred in concluding that Mr. Armstrong's subsequent absences, which formed the basis for the agency's removal action, were not a foreseeable result of the agency's impermissible reassignment. The agency charged Mr. Armstrong with absence without leave, failure to follow leave procedures, and insubordination for not reporting for duty after being told to do so. We find that Mr. Armstrong's alleged misconduct, like the annual leave use, is part of a natural stream of events set into play by the unlawful reassignment. The reassignment was the catalyst for his exhaustion of annual leave and subsequent unauthorized absence from duty, which was caused by Mr. Armstrong's family obligations, of which he had informed the agency prior to the reassignment. Once Mr. Armstrong was placed in a situation of being absent without leave because of his familial responsibilities, it was foreseeable that these other, related difficulties, such as failure to report for duty and failure to follow leave procedures, might occur.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, it would be ironic for an employee who follows an agency's improperly motivated directive and accepts a geographic reassignment to be placed in a worse position than an employee who refuses to accept such a reassignment at all. Mr. Armstrong reported to his reassigned position in Ohio, but was subsequently unable to work at that location due to family obligations, and was thus removed. However, if he had never reported to the reassigned position and he was removed, case law would support reinstatement to his former position. The Board's case law and two decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit highlight this situation. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Lawn</span>, 805 F.2d 1400 (9th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Curran v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 714 F.2d 913 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 9 MSPB 164, 9 MSPR 536 (1982); <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 MSPB 459, 2 MSPR 294 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> the Board refused to uphold a removal that was based on failure to report for a reassignment that the Board found was directed in retaliation for the employee's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 9 MSPR at 539 (citing <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 MSPR at 299, for the proposition that an agency that removes an employee for failure to report for a directed reassignment must show a legitimate management reason for the reassignment in order to have the removal sustained).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Ninth Circuit held similarly in <span class="Italic">Curran</span> and <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>. In <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, the agency removed the appellant from his position after he refused to report for duty following an involuntary transfer from a Seattle field office to a San Francisco field office. The Board upheld the removal, finding that a legitimate reason for the transfer existed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, noting that "[a]n involuntary transfer seriously disrupts the lives of the employee and his family...and transfers may not be ordered for improper purposes." <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, 714 F.2d at 918. The court found that, because Mr. Curran was not transferred for legitimate management reasons, he must be reinstated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Also instructive is the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>. There the employee sought injunctive relief from a removal action that was based on his failure to report for a directed transfer from Los Angeles to Detroit. The agency argued that the appeal of the transfer was moot following the employee's removal. However, the court ruled to the contrary, finding that effective relief could be granted by ordering the employee's reinstatement to his prior position. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 805 F.2d at 1403 (9th Cir. 1986). Here, the ALJ's finding that even though the reassignment was improperly motivated Mr. Armstrong should not be returned to his former position would place him in a worse position than the employees in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, and <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, who never reported for duty at their reassigned location.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cooke v. US Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 401 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) does not require a different result. In <span class="Italic">Cooke</span>, the Board had held that the directed reassignment was improper because it was not effected correctly. However, the Board upheld the subsequent removal based on Mr. Cooke's failure to report to the new assignment because the agency had legitimate reasons for the reassignment. An employee who refuses a reassignment because it is improperly motivated is clearly in a different position from an employee whose transfer is ordered for legitimate reasons, but incorrectly processed, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Cooke....</span></p>
