<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-180"><span class="space">1.</span> Interpretation of Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If the information required by Board regulations is supplied to the Board, the appeal may take any form, from a handwritten note to a fancy captioned document that would be as acceptable in an appellate court as it is with the Board. The Board's regulations do not provide for any specific format for appeals. They may be in letter format. <span class="Italic">Gala v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 474, 478 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Melendez v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 128, 131 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 153 (2007) (interpreting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>'s request for compensatory damages as an appeal; "The Board has a long history of construing <span class="Italic">pro se</span> pleadings liberally....&#8197;In addition, hypertechnical common law pleading is not Board practice."); <span class="Italic">Keene v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 47 MSPR 41, 44 (1991) (appellant's letter stating the intent to appeal an agency action was sufficient to invoke the appellate process). Before the onset of electronic filing, the author generally used an appeal in letter format, addressed to the chief administrative judge of the regional or field office, that followed the regulation defining the required content of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulations require certain information. An appellant's intent to appeal should be liberally construed even if inartfully expressed. <span class="Italic">Hays v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 84 MSPR 443, 447 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) ("The <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's original submission provided sufficient detail concerning her retirement and resignation that the administrative judge should have been alerted to the fact that the appellant may have been attempting to appeal these personnel actions shortly after the field office received this submission."); <span class="Italic">Neal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 513, 515 (1986) (letter from the appellant to the regional office stating the appellant's desire to appeal his separation met the deadline for filing; the remaining information was supplied by a subsequent appeal petition), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Bell v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 128, 130 (1986) (correspondence to the AJ concerning the status of an OPM reconsideration decision constituted an appeal); <span class="Italic">Perlman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 125, 127 n.* (1984) (involving a statement of defense). An attempt to appeal a retirement determination through the pleading "Appellant's Motion to Have His Claim Freezed and/or To be Held In Abeyance," stopped the clock running on the appeal deadline. <span class="Italic">Quarezo v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 522, 523 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 50 MSPR 188, 190 (1991) (timely appeal stating an EEO complaint, later amended to provide proper information concerning an appeal, amounted to a timely appeal: "The fact that she initially submitted the wrong information on her appeal form cannot be the basis for dismissal of her appeal on the grounds of timeliness."); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 246, 248 (1988) (petition seeking enforcement of an unfiled settlement agreement, arguably outside the Board's jurisdiction, should have been construed by the AJ to have also appealed a RIF within the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Dyer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 407, 408 (1984) (albeit inartfully drawn, the appellant's correspondence to the AJ constituted an appeal); <span class="Italic">Cade v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 19 MSPR 607, 608 n.* (1984) (appeal was remanded when a document filed with the Board headquarters office as a PFR was clearly meant to be an appeal); <span class="Italic">Webb v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 541, 543 (1988) (AJ should have adjudicated the claim of an involuntary retirement raised in an appeal from an OPM overpayment determination). <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Carmack v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 397, 402 (1991) (recognizing that AJs are to interpret pleadings liberally, particularly those of <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants, but denying that the appellant alleged age discrimination through her statement in the prehearing submission that she failed to see why the "mere fact that [she]was age 60...would affect [her]annuity"; the appellant did not indicate anywhere that she intended the statement as an allegation of discrimination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The claimed inability of the appellant to conduct <span class="Italic">pro se</span> representation may cause the Board carefully to examine the record for expressions by the appellant of defenses that the AJ should have considered, <span class="Italic">Lawson v. VA</span>, NY-0752-10-0185-I-1 (NP 4/10/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge noted that the appellant had not raised any affirmative defenses. As a general rule, an appellant is responsible for asserting her claims with reasonable clarity and precision. <span class="Italic">See Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1037 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Keefer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 476, &#x00B6; 18 n.2 (2002). We recognize that unrepresented appellants "are not expected to frame issues with the precision of a common law pleading." <span class="Italic">Roche v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 828 F.2d 1555, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Still, a litigant whose submissions lack clarity accepts the risk of not having clearly made her arguments before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Grubb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 23 (2004); <span class="Italic">cf. Roche</span>, 828 F.2d at 1558 ("Roche has not just raised a justiciable issue in language which may be so read as to <span id="Page_1162"></span>constitute a sufficient allegation; the allegation fairly leaps off the pages of his submissions."). Nevertheless, given the appellant's assertions that she was prejudiced by not having an attorney or other representative below, we have carefully considered the record to determine whether she made any assertions below that could be viewed as an attempt to raise the type of arguments that her new representative is asserting on review, <span class="Italic">cf. Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 76 (2012) (considering on review an argument that the appellant had raised, "albeit somewhat inartfully," in submissions during proceedings before the administrative judge "while she lacked attorney representation"). We find nothing that could be construed as an attempt to raise such affirmative defenses in even a general or imprecise way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appeal form used by the appellant to initiate her appeal provided an explicit opportunity for her to indicate her intent to file such "other claims" or affirmative defenses, the appellant did not do so, though she completed other sections of the form. We have further reviewed her submissions in the record below and find nothing that reasonably indicated her intent to pursue any of the affirmative defenses set forth in her petition for review. <span class="Italic">Cf. Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 53, 57 (1997) (remanding for adjudication of certain affirmative defenses because the appellant's allegations below were sufficient to show that she was raising such affirmative defenses that the administrative judge was required to address). We have reviewed, in particular, the appellant's numerous assertions in the record below of being "harassed." After careful consideration of the appellant's submissions, we find that the appellant did not allege facts that could be construed as an attempt to raise one of the affirmative defenses she is pursuing for the first time on review. Instead, her "harassment" claims amount to assertions that, for instance, agency employees were harassing her about matters such as her financial habits, or her taking leave or accruing overtime. These harassment claims were not a cognizable affirmative defense because they were not accompanied by even a general allegation that the harassment was based on, for instance, gender, age, race, disability, or any other prohibited factor. <span class="Italic">See generally Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of gender discrimination because his allegations of harassment were not based on the gender of those involved).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board need not look behind every ill-pled petition to divine the substance of the claim, it cannot ignore the substance of a document. When a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> PFR would clearly have put the Board on notice that it was actually an appeal from an appellant's removal, the Board should have so treated it and directed the region to hear the case rather than dismissing the PFR for lack of conformance with regulations governing PFRs. <span class="Italic">Parrish v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-1031). <span class="Italic">Melnick v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 97-98 (1989), admonished:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge is expected to interpret pleadings liberally. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 159, 1 MSPR 163, 192 (1979). Further, the parties, particularly those without the benefit of legal counsel, are not required to plead the issues with the precision required of an attorney in a judicial proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roche v. USPS</span>, 828 F.2d 1555, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1987). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Walter Reed Army Medical Center</span>, 29 MSPR 187, 189 (1985) (an issue may be considered raised if a party introduces evidence into the record without objection); <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Department of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 190, 193 (1984) (the administrative judge must attempt to clarify the issue where the appellant sets forth facts which tend to constitute the essence of an affirmative defense).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ryan v. ICC</span>, 70 MSPR 17, 20 (1996) (following <span class="Italic">Melnick</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notions of liberality aside, the Board accords itself considerable discretion in determining what constitutes an appeal. In <span class="Italic">Fye v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 315 (1980), the appellant wrote to the Board's field office, stating he was a disabled veteran, fired from the agency for reasons he did not understand; he was requesting information from the Board "as to what I need to submit for an appeal to your office"; that he was asking the Board for its help. The AJ sent the appellant copies of the Board regulations. In subsequent correspondence, the appellant intimated that his union was pursuing a grievance for him concerning the adverse action. When it later appeared that the union was not assisting the employee, the appellant advised the Board of his interest in a hearing. The AJ characterized his letters as an appeal, but then dismissed the appeal as untimely. The result was affirmed. Although the AJ, in his discretion, could have regarded the initial inquiry from the employee as a timely appeal, under the circumstances the AJ did not abuse his discretion by regarding the inquiry as only a request for information. If the union provided the appellant with bad information concerning his appeal rights, that was not good cause for extending the time to file an appeal: the union was responsible for providing proper advice concerning filing of the appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Mincey v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 663, 667 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Fye</span> for the proposition that "the Board encourages a liberal interpretation of pleadings in order to minimize the number of appeals which are rejected as untimely"). However, a reviewing court suggested a different approach in <span class="Italic">Dyer v. TVA</span>, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/972/1353/178219/">972 F.2d 1353</a> (Fed. Cir. 1992). There, the appellant received an EEO final decision stating that he could appeal to the Board within 20 days. Within this time, the appellant sent a letter to the Board stating that he would like to file an appeal and asking for the documents needed to file a formal complaint. He filed the Board's appeal form 17 days after he received the material from the Board, but not within the 20 days allowed by the EEO final decision. The Board was required by the court to reconsider whether the letter from the appellant to the Board was sufficient to serve as the timely initiation of the appeal.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Koury v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 219, 225 &#x00B6; 8 (1999), provides analysis of an IRA appeal deemed acceptable even though it did not provide all the information required by regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's original submission identified the appellant's former employer and included the following: (1) a copy of OSC's response describing the appellant's complaints; (2) a copy of OSC's letter informing the appellant of his right to file an IRA appeal with the Board; and (3) a letter in which the appellant described the circumstances surrounding the agency actions about which he complained to OSC. Although this submission may not have included each item required by the Board's regulations, it was sufficient to put the administrative judge and the agency on notice of the exact nature of the appellant's claims. Furthermore, the appellant was proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span> at the time he filed his appeal, and his subsequent submissions were sufficient to cure the deficiencies in his original filing. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 MSPR 311 &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (the pleadings filed by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant are not held to the same standard as those drafted by an attorney in a judicial proceeding). Thus, because the administrative judge could have waived the regulatory requirements with which the appellant's original submission did not comply, we discern no error in the fact that the administrative judge proceeded to adjudicate the appellant's original submission as a timely-filed IRA appeal. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.12; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Behrendt v. Department of the Navy,</span> 22 MSPR 72, 73 n.* (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Army</span>, 100 MSPR 274, 277-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2005), the appellant was separated from the agency and used the Board's appeal form to initiate his case. That form, designed to fit every situation known to the Board, can be a problem to decipher. The Board decided that it would excuse the appellant from the failure to state that he was invoking the Board's adverse action jurisdiction in addition to its USERRA jurisdiction and sent the case back to the regional office for consideration of the adverse action case. The appellant placed enough information in the Board's form, and in a subsequent submission to the AJ, to alert a careful reader that his appeal could be considered under both Chapter 75 and USERRA jurisdiction.
