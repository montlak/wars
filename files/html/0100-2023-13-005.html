<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-6"><span class="space">b.</span> Citizenship</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 1975, regulations of the Civil Service Commission provided at 5 CFR 338.101(b): "A person may be given appointment only if he is a citizen of or owes permanent allegiance to the United States." The Supreme Court invalidated that regulation as unconstitutional in <span class="Italic">Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong</span>, 426 U.S. 88 (1976). The Court decided that the rule deprived noncitizens of Fifth Amendment liberty interests without due process of law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an attempt to meet the regulatory infirmity, on September 2, 1976, the President issued Executive Order 11935, adopting a new section, now redesignated 5 CFR 7.3 (2022) (substituting "OPM" for "The Commission") of regulations governing the civil service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Citizenship</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;No person shall be admitted to competitive examination unless such person is a citizen or national of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;No person shall be given any appointment in the competitive service unless such person is a citizen or national of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;OPM may, as an exception to this rule and to the extent permitted by law, authorize the appointment of aliens to positions in the competitive service when necessary to promote the efficiency of the service in specific cases or for temporary appointments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a memorandum to the Speaker of the House, President Ford stated on September 2, 1976, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I have concluded that it is in the national interest to preserve the long-standing policy of generally prohibiting the employment of aliens from positions in the competitive service, except where the efficiency of the service or the national interest dictate otherwise in specific cases or circumstances. It is also my judgment that it would be detrimental to the efficiency of the civil service, as well as contrary to the national interest, precipitously to employ aliens in the competitive service without an appropriate determination that it is in the national interest to do so. Therefore, I am issuing an executive order which generally prohibits the employment of aliens in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The constitutionality of the Executive Order and the corresponding regulation was confirmed through continuing litigation in <span class="Italic">Vergara v. Hampton</span>, 581 F.2d 1281 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Civil Service Commission</span>, 430 F. Supp. 422 (DPR 1977). Other cases address limitations expressed in appropriations statutes governing federal employment of noncitizens. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yuen v. IRS</span>, 649 F.2d 163 (2d Cir. 1981). <span class="Italic">aff'g</span>. <span class="Italic">Yuen v. IRS</span>, 497 F. Supp. 1023 (SDNY 1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through its now sunsetted (obsolete) Federal Personnel Manual Ch. 300, Subch. 11, 11-2 (1991), OPM provided guidance on its interpretation or application of the Executive Order, the regulation it promulgated, and the oversight responsibility of OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;OPM exceptions. The following are exceptions to the requirements of Executive Order 11935 for United States citizenship for the competitive service. An agency may employ an alien under one of these exceptions only if the employment also meets the requirements of the appropriation act restriction on paying aliens and the immigration law ban on hiring aliens unless they are authorized to accept employment (see Sections 11-3 and 11-4 of this Subchapter).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The citizenship requirement does not apply to 1-month special needs appointments (see Chapter 316).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The citizenship requirement does not apply to the noncompetitive appointment of specially qualified scientific and professional personnel for research and development activities under 5 U.S.C. 3104 (originally Pub. L. 313 of 1947). See Subchapter 3 of Chapter 319.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;When OPM approves an appointment without competitive examination in rare cases, it may waive the citizenship requirement (see Chapter 316).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;When no qualified citizens are available and the appropriate OPM examining office (or agency examining office delegated approval authority by OPM) approves, an agency may fill a competitive position by the excepted appointment of an alien under Section 213.3102(bb) of Schedule A (see Chapter 213).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;An agency's request for approval must include a statement describing the agency's efforts to recruit qualified citizens. The statement must be in sufficient detail to establish that the agency's search of all likely recruitment sources has been diligent and thorough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;The examining office considers the agency's justification and determines whether any qualified candidates are recruitable and, if it maintains an appropriate list of eligibles for the job, whether any qualified eligibles are available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;If the examining office approves the request, the position is removed from the competitive service for the duration of the alien's incumbency. An alien appointed under Section 213.3102(bb) of Schedule A who gains United States citizenship may remain in the position with no change in appointment or status as an excepted employee. The employee may not be converted non-competitively in the same position or to a position in the competitive service, but must qualify for competitive appointment for such placement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;Employment outside the competitive service. The requirement for United States citizenship in Executive Order 11935 does not apply to persons appointed to positions in the excepted service (see Chapter 213) and the Senior Executive Service (see FPM Supplement 920-1, Subchapter S5). An agency may employ an alien in such positions only if the employment is permitted under the appropriation act restriction on paying aliens and the immigration law restriction on hiring aliens who are not authorized to work (see Sections 11-3 and 11-4 of this Subchapter).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d.&#x2003;United States citizens in outlying areas. Natives of the following areas are United States citizens: Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, including Saipan, Rota, and Tinian; Puerto Rico; and the Virgin Islands of the United States, including St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Meanwhile, OPM retained as a component of its regulations 5 CFR 338.101 (2022) (the regulation reviewed in <span class="Italic">Mow Sun Wong</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Citizenship</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;A person may be admitted to competitive examination only if he is a citizen of or owes permanent allegiance to the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A person may be given an appointment in the competitive service only if he or she is a citizen of or owes permanent allegiance to the United States. However, a noncitizen may be given an appointment in rare cases under &#x00A7; 316.601 of this chapter, unless the appointment is prohibited by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Paragraph (b) of this section applies to reinstatement and transfer as well as to other noncompetitive appointments, and to conversion to career or career-conditional employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 316.601 (2022), first issued in 1979 and not since revised, in turn provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appointment without competitive examination in rare cases.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency may make an appointment without competitive examination when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The duties and compensation of the position are such, or qualified persons are so rare, that in the interest of good civil service administration the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination;</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The result is that citizenship may be required for examination or appointment in the competitive service, but in 5 CFR 7.3 (2022), OPM holds unto itself the discretion to waive the requirement under circumstances not described in regulation or binding OPM guidance, and in 5 CFR 338.101 (2022). OPM makes reference to the circumstances described in 5 CFR 316.601 (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (2007), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>, for agencies having delegated authority to process competitive service appointments, provides some, but not definitive guidance, concerning citizenship issues and the process for determining whether citizenship requirements should be waived under the discretion provided by regulation to OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citizenship--Citizenship requirement</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No individual may compete for a civil service job unless the individual is a citizen or national of the United States (see 5 CFR section 7.4, 5 CFR Part 338 and 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1408). For more information on citizenship requirements visit: <a href="https://www.opm.gov/">www.opm.gov</a>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What to do if the applicant is a non-citizen</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States may not compete for or be appointed to a position in the competitive service, except when necessary to promote the efficiency of the service, such as when there are no qualified U.S. citizen (see 5 CFR section 7.4.) Therefore, you may not accept applications from non-citizens. If there is a question about an applicant's citizenship (e.g., the applicant failed to answer this question on the application form), the application <span class="Italic">may</span> be accepted and processed. If the individual is subsequently referred on a certificate, you should annotate his/her name with instructions to verify citizenship before appointment. You must verify citizenship before appointment (5 CFR Part 338).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Comptroller General suggested that a noncitizen appointment in violation of a parallel, earlier regulation of the Civil Service Commission left the appointment voidable but not void, with the result that compensation received by the employee appointed could be retained by the employee. Comp. Gen. B-130539, 37 Comp. Gen. 483 (Jan. 20, 1958).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Bridgeman v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 53, 56 (1984), the appellant was terminated by cancelation of his original appointment because he was not a citizen at the time he was competitively appointed. The Board discerned no statutory prohibition or other absolute bar existing as to the appointment, but the Board recognized Executive Order 11935 and 5 CFR 7.4 (1984) [now 5 CFR 7.3 (2022)]. The Board noted that pursuant to its regulation, OPM retains at least some discretion as to alien appointments, and the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In at least one recent instance, the OPM invoked this discretionary authority and granted a "variation to correct an Erroneous Appointment" pursuant to its authority under Rule V to permit the continued employment of an individual who was not a citizen at the time of her original appointment but who became a citizen while employed. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual Bulletin 315-72 (April 29, 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Bridgeman was ordered reinstated because the agency did not provide due process (notice and reply rights) as to the removal. The merits of the removal, that is, whether service efficiency was advanced by removing the noncitizen, were not addressed by the Board. On a request for reconsideration from OPM, the Board reaffirmed its original decision, <span class="Italic">Bridgeman v. DHUD</span>, 25 MSPR 178 (1984), noting that "[t]o whom the exception is to apply, as interpreted by OPM, is not at issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 181. Another decision, <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-10-0263-I-1 (NP 5/13/2011), reversed the removal of a noncitizen for lack of constitutional due process reply rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of the case are not in dispute. The appellant is a tenured employee in the competitive service as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 who was removed--without any notice of a proposed action or opportunity to respond--on the basis of her ineligibility for appointment because she was not a United States citizen. In her initial decision, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant had Board appeal rights because she had been employed in the competitive service and had completed her one-year probationary period <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. Department of State</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 16 (2006); <span class="Italic">Bridgeman v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 53, 56, <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 178 (1984). She also found that, in failing to afford the appellant notice of, or a right to respond to, the removal, the agency deprived the appellant of her constitutional right to minimum due process. Having so found, she properly reversed the removal action. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 684 (1991) (applying <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both below and in its petition for review, the agency argues that there was no harmful procedural error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 because, in the absence of its error, the agency still would have reached the same conclusion to remove the appellant. This argument fails, however, because the Board has long recognized that an appellant need not demonstrate harmful error with regard to constitutional due process violations. <span class="Italic">See Stephen,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 684-685. Rather, "when an appealable action against a nonprobationary Federal employee has not been effected in accordance with minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process of law under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, the action must be reversed because it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 684.<span class="Italic"></span> Here, there is no question that the appellant was deprived of the notice and opportunity to respond required by <span class="Italic">Loudermill.</span> Accordingly, in the absence of this notice, the removal cannot be sustained and the agency's action is not analyzed for harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Daniel v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 459, 461-62 (1995).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The current version of Civil Service Rule V, referenced in <span class="Italic">Bridgeman</span>, is 5 CFR 5.1 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director, Office of Personnel Management, shall promulgate and enforce regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the Civil Service Act and the Veterans' Preference Act, as reenacted in title 5, United States Code, the Civil Service Rules, and all other statutes and Executive orders imposing responsibilities on the Office. The Director is authorized, whenever there are practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships in complying with the strict letter of the regulation, to grant a variation from the strict letter of the regulation if such a variation is within the spirit of the regulations, and the efficiency of the Government and the integrity of the competitive service are protected and promoted. Whenever a variation is granted the Director shall note the official record to show:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a) The particular practical difficulty or hardship involved, (b) what is permitted in place of what is required by regulations, (c) the circumstances which protect or promote the efficiency of the Government and the integrity of the competitive service, and (d) a statement limiting the application of the variation to the continuation of the conditions which gave rise to it. Like variations shall be granted whenever like conditions exist. All such decisions and information concerning variations noted in the official record shall be published promptly in a Federal Personnel Manual Letter or Bulletin and in the Director's next annual report.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of a statutory prohibition was extended to appointments in violation of American treaties ratified by the Senate. An individual appointed in violation of a treaty provision had no Board appeal right because he was not validly appointed to a position within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daneshpayeh v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 57 MSPR 672, 676 (1993) (as to a NATO/SOFA treaty: a U.S. citizen who is an "ordinary resident" in the host country may not be part of the "civilian component" employed by the United States). As to disqualification for appointment generally, an appointment was not statutorily invalid because the appellant was not a citizen. The bar against noncitizen appointments is in Executive Order 11935 (Sept. 2, 1976) and 5 CFR 7.3 (2022). OPM may waive the bar. If an employee is dismissed for noncitizen status, the employee should be granted adverse action rights. [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-148.html#sec1-147">Alien; Noncitizen</a>."]</p>
