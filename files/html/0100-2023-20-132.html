<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblowing allegations in an IRA case are reviewed by the Board to determine whether they are nonfrivolous. Board regulations address the nature and form of nonfrivolous allegations, 5 CFR 1201.4 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(s)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonfrivolous allegation</span>. A nonfrivolous allegation is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue. An allegation generally will be considered nonfrivolous when, under oath or penalty of perjury, an individual makes an allegation that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is more than conclusory;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is plausible on its face; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Is material to the legal issues in the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note the requirement that the allegations be made under oath or penalty of perjury. Failure to meet that requirement may lead to dismissals of allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-752S-15-1086-I-2 (NP 9/26/2016) ("Additionally, she did not submit any sworn statement or other evidence in support of her allegations. The appellant thus failed to nonfrivolously allege that she made protected disclosures pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)."). The Board appeal form calls for a certification that conforms with the Federal False Statements Act, and the on-line appeal process asks whether statements are made with personal knowledge and under the same type of certification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When is an allegation more than conclusory, plausible on its face, and material to the legal issues in the appeal--so as to be nonfrivolous? Decisions are somewhat circular, as in <span class="Italic">Gabel v. VA</span>, 2023 MSPB 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board's regulations define a nonfrivolous allegation as an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s). As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently put it: "[T]he question of whether the appellant has non-frivolously alleged protected disclosures [or activities] that contributed to a personnel action must be determined based on whether the employee alleged sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face." <span class="Italic">Hessami v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 979 F.3d 1362, 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2020).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A nonfrivolous allegation of a protected whistleblowing disclosure is an allegation of facts that, if proven, would show that the appellant disclosed a matter that a reasonable person in her position would believe evidenced one of the categories of wrongdoing specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Mudd v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). The test to determine whether a putative whistleblower has a reasonable belief in the disclosure is an objective one: whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions of the agency evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Salerno</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6. The disclosures must be specific and detailed, not vague allegations of wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see El v. Department of Commerce</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 6 (2015) (stating that vague, conclusory, unsupported, and <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations of alleged wrongdoing do not meet the nonfrivolous pleading standard needed to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 663 F. App'x 921 (Fed. Cir. 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the administrative judge noted, however, the appellant failed to provide with any specificity the content of her alleged disclosures, to whom they were made, the dates they were made, or how they were made....We agree that the appellant's vague and nonspecific allegations of disclosures of wrongdoing are insufficient to constitute nonfrivolous allegations of protected disclosures....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. MSPB,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210323192">853 Fed. Appx. 648</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) (Judge Newman concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, "it suffices that an appellant exhaust his remedies before the Office of Special Counsel and present 'non-frivolous allegations'" of an act of whistleblowing and a personnel action, as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a), taken in reprisal. <span class="Italic">Cahill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 821 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016). A "non-frivolous" allegation is one that, "if proven, can establish the Board's jurisdiction insofar as that element is concerned." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). This is a relatively low bar for appellants to satisfy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nonfrivolous allegation to the Board of a whistleblowing disclosure that resulted in reprisal requires the appellant to inform the Board of the specifics of the underlying whistleblowing disclosure as well as the information revealed to OSC concerning that disclosure and the reprisals suffered as a result. <span class="Italic">DiGiorgio v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 84 MSPR 6, 12-13 &#x00B6; 12 (1999), noted the unfavorable result for portions of one appeal when the disclosures below were insufficiently described to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant did not provide the Board with copies of the July 1993 disclosure, the alleged disclosures presented to OSC in case number MA-94-1685, the information he provided to Inspector General personnel in 1995, the suggestions regarding waste he allegedly provided in January 1996 to the five major commands in his chain, the information he <span id="Page_3877"></span>allegedly provided members of the Armed Services Committee in March 1996, or the disclosures he allegedly presented to the Commanding Officer of FTSCLANT on November 18, 1996. Nor has he described any of those alleged disclosures in a fashion detailed enough to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of having made a protected disclosure. Although the appellant did include a copy of his November 16, 1996 complaint to OSC, that complaint did not make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of whistleblowing. We therefore conclude that the appellant is not entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on any of these alleged disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may give a more detailed account of their whistleblowing activities before the Board than they did to OSC. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 8, &#x00B6; 10 (2022) (citing <span class="Italic">Briley v. NARA</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Young v. MSPB</span>, 961 F.3d 1323, 1328-29 (Fed.

Cir. 1993), and adding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, Ms. Young's allegations of time and attendance violations were conclusory and lacked any specificity as to particular instances in which the violations allegedly occurred. Her assertions, for example, that employees were taking longer breaks than were permitted and that "no work was being done" were so general in nature that those allegations, standing alone, did not rise to the level of non-frivolous allegations of violations of a law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, or an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under those circumstances, it was appropriate for the administrative judge to insist on greater specificity from Ms. Young in order to determine whether she had made non-frivolous allegations of qualifying disclosures. Yet, when the administrative judge directed Ms. Young to provide additional factual support for her allegations, she did not respond.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to<span class="Italic"> Sinko v. USDA</span>, 102 MSPR 116, 124 &#x00B6; 17, 2006 MSPB 134 (2006), "an appellant's statements regarding his protected disclosures can be so defective on their face that the Board will find that they fail to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a reasonable belief, and thus require dismissal for lack of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dept. of Energy,</span> DC-0752-13-0280-I-2 (NP 7/6/2015), added as to a whistleblowing reprisal defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense by the preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(iii).

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Benton-Flores v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-13-0522-B-2, n.2 (NP 1/23/2023), demonstrated the necessity for the appellant to provide particularized references to documents alleged to buttress an IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her remand initial decision, the administrative judge noted that the appellant submitted a report of investigation from a related equal employment opportunity discrimination complaint totaling over 3,000 pages. The administrative judge explained that, in the absence of specific citations to that evidence, she had not independently examined the report to determine whether anything contained within supported the appellant's burden in this appeal. For the same reasons, we have considered the evidence the appellant referenced in her petition for review, but we have not otherwise pored through the exhaustive record. <span class="Italic">See Keefer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 476, &#x00B6; 18 n.2 (2002) (recognizing that an appellant is required to articulate claims with reasonable clarity and precision and that "it is not the Board's obligation to pore through the record...or to construe and make sense of allegations that [are] set forth at various parts of an extremely voluminous case file"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(a)(2) (requiring that a petition for review "explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect and identify specific evidence in the record that demonstrates the error").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant does not establish jurisdiction based on the allegation that OSC inadequately investigated her case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bland v. VA,</span> DA-1221-10-0374-W-1 (NP 3/3/2011) ("Moreover, the Board does not have jurisdiction over claims that OSC has not adequately investigated a case, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a) (listing the types of actions over which the Board has jurisdiction) and allegations of prohibited personnel practices such as nepotism do not confer Board jurisdiction absent an otherwise appealable action, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks v.

Although <span class="Italic">Luecht</span> ordered a remand based on information gleaned from the record as a whole, the Board noted of one disclosure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states that on April 12 and 13, 1999, he met with the Navy Inspector General (IG) regarding "on-going fraud in R/S contracts at NAVHOSPNCLA.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues we cannot consider the content of Dr. Smolinski's testimony, but rather must constrain our analysis to the four corners of his OSC complaints. The government cites <span class="Italic">Hessami</span>, but that case merely held that the Board must accept as true a complainant's well-pleaded factual allegations in assessing jurisdiction notwithstanding agency evidence that undermines those allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 979 F.3d at 1371. It did not hold that we must turn a blind eye to evidence specifically referenced in and supporting a complainant's allegations, like the April 2018 testimony. We detect no error in considering this evidence for purposes of determining whether Dr. Smolinski nonfrivolously alleged that he made a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/CHAPMAN_SHERYL_EVON_DC_1221_17_0376_W_1_REMAND_ORDER_1994258.pdf">DC-1221-17-0376-W-1</a> (NP 1/18/2023) (although appellant's narrative response to show cause order lacked necessary detail, the AJ should have considered the information in appellant's OSC submissions, including OSC's closeout letters).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ must consider the allegations that the appellant raised throughout the entire record before deciding to dismiss an IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Benton-Flores v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 428, 432-33 &#x00B6; 6, 2014 MSPB 60 (2014), but volumes of paper and a multitude of allegations are no substitute for analysis (by the AJ or the appellant) of the protected nature of the disclosures relied on by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 387-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-24 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the issue of whether the appellant made protected disclosures can be dispositive of other issues in this case, we address it first. There is no dispute between the parties that the appellant made numerous disclosures over a period of years. Based on the appellant's categorization of these numerous disclosures, the AJ considered them in two groups.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first group, which the appellant described as external disclosures, concerned the appellant's belief that the agency administered its oil and gas program in a manner that showed undue deference to or influence of the oil and gas industry. The AJ found that these disclosures were not protected because they concerned the appellant's disagreements with the agency's policy decisions. He also found that the appellant did not have a reasonable belief that her disclosures were protected because she was a relatively low-level employee and not privy to the reasoning behind the agency's policy decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second group, which the appellant described as internal disclosures, concerned the appellant's numerous reports of the alleged wrongdoing of her co-workers and supervisors, including alleged time and attendance fraud, misuse of government-owned vehicles, and personal use of government telephones, computers, fax machines, and other government equipment. The AJ found that the appellant's disclosures concerning these matters reflected "her inflexible notions as to appropriate policies and procedures and what constitutes 'right and wrong,'" and that these disclosures were not protected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the AJ's analysis of whether the appellant made a protected disclosure to be lacking. <span class="Italic">Cf. Luecht v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 297 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (dismissal of an IRA appeal without attempting to discern whether the appellant's submissions constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction is not appropriate). The AJ never analyzed any of the appellant's specific disclosures or determined whether any of them fit within any of the types of disclosures that are considered to be protected. Admittedly, the record in this appeal is voluminous. The appellant submitted hundreds of pages of alleged protected disclosures into the record, as well as a 21-page chart listing her various disclosures dating <span id="Page_3878"></span>back to 1991. Although she provided copies of some of her alleged protected disclosures, she has made no effort at any point to explain why she believes that these disclosures evidence a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. Instead, the appellant has submitted large quantities of documents without making an attempt to explain their significance or to identify for the Board which documents are the most important to her case and why. Further, the appellant seems to have brought every possible disclosure to the Board's attention, rather than winnowing the important issues from the trivial and focusing on the matters on which she bears the greatest chance of success. In so doing, the appellant has not served her case well. This manner of litigation places a strain on the resources of the Board, and especially on the Board's corps of AJs, that cannot easily be borne without sacrificing the timeliness and quality of adjudication for everyone who appears before the Board. <span class="Italic">Cf. Luecht</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 297 &#x00B6; 8 ("The appellant would have been wise to follow the administrative judge's instructions because one whose submissions lack clarity risks being found to have failed to meet his burden of proof.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, whatever one may think of how a case ideally should be brought, the appellant is entitled to a fair adjudication of the case she <span class="Italic">has</span> brought, and she is entitled to some review of her alleged protected disclosures in order to determine whether any of them are, in fact, protected. We have not conducted an exhaustive review of <span class="Italic">all</span> of the appellant's alleged protected disclosures, and we need not do so under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. Gr<span class="Italic">eenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 247 &#x00B6; 14 (2003) (the appellant established jurisdiction over his IRA appeal by, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, making "nonfrivolous allegations that he engaged in at least one instance of whistleblowing"). We have determined, however, that the appellant has shown that at least two of her disclosures were protected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the AJ must carefully examine the record, each separate appeal stands on its own record (allowing for a difference in treatment of joined appeals). <span class="Italic">Chin-Young v. Dept. of Transp</span>., AT-1221-17-0217-W-1 (NP 1/13/2023), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments on review essentially derive from the misconception that evidence submitted in his prior appeals is available to and should be considered by the administrative judge. In a refiled appeal, the Board informs the parties that documents already in the record need not be resubmitted. That instruction does not apply in a newly filed appeal with an entirely different docket number. The administrative judge twice ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument showing Board jurisdiction, and so the appellant should have done so rather than assume that the administrative judge would retrieve the files from the appellant's earlier cases and search through them for anything that might be relevant in this case. There is nothing from the administrative judge in this file that could reasonably be interpreted to mean that the appellant could rely on the records generated in his other cases or that he need not introduce evidence in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board noted the need for focus in IRA pleadings and submissions, <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. DHHS,</span> DC-1221-10-0458-W-1 (NP 5/25/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's practice of filing multiple, untimely documents and his failure to include all necessary information in each filing has made his case thus far unnecessarily unwieldy and difficult to adjudicate. <span class="Italic">See Grubb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 377, <span class="Italic">&#x00B6;</span> 23 (2004); <span class="Italic">Keefer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 476, &#x00B6; 18 n.2 (2002) ("[A]n appellant is required to articulate his claims with 'reasonable clarity and precision.'"). Thus, we also emphasize to the appellant that he must strictly abide by the Board's guidelines and deadlines and pay particular attention to the administrative judge's orders. <span class="Italic">See Luecht v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) ("The appellant would have been wise to follow the administrative judge's instructions because one whose submissions lack clarity risks being found to have failed to meet his burden of proof.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant should demonstrate in an IRA case that the allegations to the Board parallel the allegations to OSC. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 337, 342 &#x00B6; 17 (2005) ("although the appellant raised his 2003 low performance appraisal to OSC, he has not proven that he raised the same set of factual allegations to OSC that he is raising before the Board with respect to his alleged protected disclosures and, thus, he has not shown that he provided OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation of those factual allegations"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Horton v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 234, 239-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 2007 MSPB 164 (2007) ("The appellant's descriptions of this disclosure in his OSC complaint and on appeal are not precisely the same, but they are substantially the same, particularly considering that the appellant was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> at the time he filed his OSC complaint"; "we find that the allegations with respect to disclosure 3 are substantially the same on appeal as they were in the OSC complaint, and we find that the appellant has shown that he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to disclosure"; "although the administrative judge found that he appellant did not raise this allegation before OSC, the narrative he attached to his OSC complaint clearly raises this disclosure.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is the duty of the parties in an IRA to make clear to the Board whether or not jurisdictional requirements were met. The parties are not to simply refer the Board to the assembled record, <span class="Italic">Keefer v. USDA</span>, 92 MSPR 476, 484 n.2 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We nevertheless remind the appellants that it is not the Board's obligation to "pore through the record," as they suggest, or to construe and make sense of allegations that set forth at various parts of an extremely voluminous case file. Rather, the affirmative responsibility to present evidence and argument is that of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Embry v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation,</span> 12 MSPB 78, 13 M.S.P.R. 505, 507 (1982).

Dept. of Interior</span>, CH-1221-14-0284-W-1 (NP 8/19/2014) ("Lastly, the appellant's suggestion that the administrative judge should have contacted various individuals to obtain information relevant to his appeal is misplaced.

<p class="Body-Text">If specifics of what type of disclosure of a law, rule, or regulation are lacking in the MSPB appeal, they will be considered by the Board if the specific alleged violations are contained in communications between the appellant and OSC that are filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ormond v. DOJ</span>, 118 MSPR 337, 341-42 &#x00B6; 9, 2012 MSPB 88 (2012) ("The appellant's assertions concerning his belief that he disclosed a prohibited personnel practice to Mr. Eichenlaub are somewhat lacking in specificity and detail.

He also appears to have submitted to OSC copies of training materials to support his contentions that he was told during training that he should not work on a contract involving a company that had employed him within the past year, and that he should not sign off on an invoice where he had no personal knowledge of the services rendered."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gibbs v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DC-1221-11-0794-W-1 (NP 3/7/2012) (when the appellant lacked all her correspondence from OSC, but described what she had alleged, the Board inferred that she sufficiently stated her IRA case to the OSC in order to then pursue it with the Board). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DA-1221-12-0460-W-1 (NP 8/22/2013) ("although the appeal record included a copy of OSC's March 27, 2012 file closure letter, the generic closure letter from OSC is insufficient proof of exhaustion because it does not describe the precise ground of the appellant's charges of whistleblowing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The simplest way of demonstrating to the Board what was submitted to OSC is to supply with the Board appeal the OSC submissions, as <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State,</span> DC-1221-09-0356-M-1 (NP 12/16/2010), suggested as to a document that the appellant, in prior litigation in the Federal Circuit (<span class="Italic">Nasuti v. MSPB</span>, 376 Fed. Appx. 29, 33-34 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP)), asserted he submitted to OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In arguing that he was not required to submit the February 7, 2009 letter to the Board before the record closed, the appellant has parsed 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.6(a)(6) to avoid the plain language in section 1209.6(a) setting forth the pleading requirements. In introduction to that section, subsection (a) states that whistleblower appeals "may be in any format, including letter form, but <span class="Italic">must</span> contain" the items enumerated in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(5). Subsection (a)(6), upon which the appellant relies, states that an appellant may meet the Board's pleading requirements in (a)(3) through (a)(5) by filing a copy of the forms that he filed with OSC, together with any continuation sheets and supplements to any of these forms either filed with OSC or completed by OSC. Although subsection (a)(6) might be stated permissively, it is permissive only to the extent that it allows an appellant an alternative means by which to meet the <span class="Italic">mandatory</span> pleading requirements set forth in the preceding sections of the regulation. If an appellant exercises this alternative, a complete filing would include any supplements prepared by either the appellant or OSC, as subsection (a)(6) clearly states. Accordingly, to be considered, the February 7, 2009 letter should have been made part of the record before the record closed. Under the Board's regulations, it was the appellant's responsibility to make it so by timely submitting it. Contrary to the appellant's assertions, his obligations regarding his pleading are clearly stated in the Board's regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.6(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.58(c) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.59(c)]</p>
