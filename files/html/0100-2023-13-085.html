<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-85"><span class="space">a.</span> Hearing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether the use of leave is voluntary is frequently jurisdictional. Under <span class="Italic">Abbott v. USPS,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ABBOTT_MARY_A_DC_0752_12_0366_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1048487.pdf">121 MSPR 294</a>, 2014 MSPB 47 (2014), when an agency initiates enforced leave by a proposal, leading to a reply and a decision, the appellant who wants a hearing gets it--as in any other adverse action. If there is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> dispute over the voluntariness of the use of leave, a hearing is required, just as it is concerning the voluntariness of other actions claimed to be constructively adverse. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yusuf v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 465, 469-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 2009 MSPB 201 (2009) (allegations of being placed off the job and being refused work within the appellant's medical limitations should have resulted in a jurisdictional hearing based on nonfrivolous allegations rather than dismissal for lack of proof of jurisdiction by preponderant evidence); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 7 MSPR 68, 72, 7 MSPB 3 (1981); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 184, 188 (2000) (AJ erred by relying on the agency's evidence, involving conflicting factual issues, and dismissing an enforced leave appeal without a jurisdictional hearing; the appellant should have been permitted to submit evidence and argument concerning the jurisdiction of the Board over his claim that his employer failed to pay him for many weeks; Board implied that the AJ should have considered the appellant's assertion that he deserved a hearing because during an enforced nonduty but paid status, the appellant did not receive overtime or premium pay); <span class="Italic">Goodenough v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 123, 128 (1998) ("[A]gency did not submit below undisputed documentary evidence showing that the appellant has no right of appeal to the Board from the constructive suspension."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 184, 188 &#x00B6; 8 (1997) ("The agency did not submit undisputed documentary evidence that tends to show that the appellant has no right to appeal his alleged constructive suspension to the Board."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 39 MSPR 210, 212 (1988) ("The appellant should have been afforded an opportunity to support his allegations with evidence or argument and to show that any of the pay discrepancies resulted in an action over which the Board would have jurisdiction, i.e., a constructive involuntary suspension or a reduction in pay.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a constructive suspension appeal, assuming that Board jurisdiction is established by nonfrivolous allegations, the appellant is entitled to a hearing to prove her case. Nonfrivolous allegations are based on the appellant's allegations and associated evidentiary submissions in support of the appeal or in response to an AJ's order to show cause or to an agency's motion to dismiss.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Manker v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 405, 411 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (dispute over availability of light duty work: "in determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive."); <span class="Italic">Nolan v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 241, 243 &#x00B6; 5 (1998) (agency policy requiring medical clearance from employees out for more than 21 days led to alleged constructive suspension: the jurisdictional disputes could not be resolved through documentation alone; the appellant was entitled to a hearing based on his nonfrivolous allegations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A hearing is not avoided by the agency's protestation that there was no work to offer the appellant, <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 382, 387 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge, in effect, found that the appellant made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Baker</span> by making a nonfrivolous allegation that he is able to work within certain restrictions and communicating his willingness to work. However, she relied on the agency's evidence in finding that there was no light duty within the appellant's restrictions available at the hours requested by the appellant. She further determined that the appellant's evidence was insufficient to show that he could not work the later hours offered by the agency. Resolution of this disputed issue required weighing the evidence and resolving conflicting factual assertions. Thus, the administrative judge committed prejudicial error when, without affording the appellant a jurisdictional hearing, she weighed the evidence and resolved the conflicting factual assertions by deeming the agency's evidence to be dispositive. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., LaPre v. Department of Justice,</span> 62 MSPR 329, 335 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant should be allowed a jurisdictional hearing if the employee provides nonfrivolous allegations that the agency barred him from working when he was ready to work--even if the evidence offered by the agency conflicts with the appellant's assertions, <span class="Italic">Burns v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 285, 287-89 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal alleging that, on April 22, 1994, he was reassigned improperly from the position of Supply Officer aboard the USNS San Diego to the agency's Marine Employment Branch in Bayonne, New Jersey, and forced to take sick leave that he "did not want." The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He found that the appellant's sick leave followed his submission to the agency of a May 10, 1994, medical statement "which found him incapable of performing the duties of his position with a projected return to work date of August 1, 1994." Based on this document, the administrative judge found that the appellant requested sick leave and submitted a medical statement to support his request, and thus his placement on sick leave was voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the May 10 statement by his physician was submitted in response to a request by the agency. He contends that an agency medical officer found him not fit for duty upon his arrival at Bayonne on April 25, and disallowed his reporting for <span id="Page_2059"></span>duty, despite his ability to work. He also asserts that he made numerous attempts to return to work after he was found not fit for duty. The appellant contends that, based on the foregoing, he has made a non-frivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, pending inquiry into the employee's physical ability to perform, constitutes a disciplinary suspension within the Board's jurisdiction because the appellant's absence from the workplace is involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Holloway v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 993 F.2d 219, 221 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 121, 126 (1994); <span class="Italic">Lunny v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 213, 215 (1990). An employee who alleges that he was placed on an enforced leave suspension has the burden of proof of Board jurisdiction, and he must carry that burden by the preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who makes a non-frivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Deloach v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 58 MSPR 574, 577 (1993). A non-frivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is an allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter in issue. <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that he was placed on enforced sick leave continuously from April 25, 1994, until at least September 7, 1994. He states that after his reassignment to Bayonne, he informed the agency of the medical care he was under, three injections of interferon per week, along with periodic blood work. The appellant states that the agency then found him not fit for duty. He also states that, immediately after his reassignment on April 22, 1994, he was placed in enforced leave status without his consent and against his wishes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among the appellant's submissions in support of his assertions are letters, dated August 15, August 26 and September 14, 1994, from his physician, Alan J. Gamsey, M.D., stating that the appellant should be able to work without restriction and that no restrictions were placed on his work during his February to September 1, 1994, course of therapy. Also included is an April 25, 1994 Supervisory Report finding the appellant not fit for duty until May 25, 1994, and a September 7, 1994, letter from the agency's medical department informing the appellant that he could not receive sick leave or return to work until a complete medical summary was received from his private physician. The evidence that the appellant could work without restriction during the entire period of his alleged enforced leave, coupled with the evidence that the agency did not allow him to report for duty and return to work, constitutes a non-frivolous allegation that he was constructively suspended for more than 14 days, and thus a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied on the appellant's May 10, 1994, Sick Leave Certificate to find that he voluntarily requested sick leave. The agency states that the appellant's submission of the Sick Leave Certificate prompted the agency to place him in a "Not Fit For Duty" status, as it precluded sea duty. As noted above, the appellant alleged circumstances that could make the sick leave request involuntary. Even if it is ultimately found, however, that the appellant voluntarily requested sick leave from May 10 through August 1, his factual assertions constitute a non-frivolous allegation that he was placed on enforced leave without pay for more than 14 days for two intervals, first from April 25 until May 10, and second from August 1 until at least September 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we REMAND this appeal to the regional office to afford the appellant a hearing on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 591, 593 (1981), it is sufficient to allege the ability and willingness to work to reach the hearing stage. The AJ is to determine whether the appellant's allegations of enforced leave status are nonfrivolous. The Board's analysis of the "allegation" often turns into an analysis of proof, but the bottom line is that a hearing should be convened if the facts support, or at least demonstrate, a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> dispute concerning a claim of a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 219, 221 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That an appellant's initial evidentiary submission is ambiguous is not a sufficient reason to deny him a hearing, <span class="Italic">Haentges v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 507, 511 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the appellant was not provided an opportunity to show that he communicated his desire to work and the agency did not allow him to return to work, the administrative judge's finding was in error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also erred in finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction on grounds that the appellant could not show that he was able to work. The administrative judge found that neither the physician's letter nor the psychiatrist's note cleared the appellant to return to work; hence, she found that the appellant had not made a nonfrivolous allegation under <span class="Italic">Baker</span> that he was able to work. Both the physician's letter and the psychiatrist's note are somewhat ambiguous but do not foreclose the possibility that the appellant could show that he was able to work during the period in question. The physician's release letter stated that the appellant was to be seen by a clinical psychologist; it did not, however, state that he could not return to work until he was seen by the psychologist. Although the psychiatrist's note of October 17, 1997, is indicative of some reluctance toward the appellant's return to work, the psychiatrist subsequently signed a medical release form that stated that as of October 17, 1997, the appellant was cleared to return to work with no medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegations and medical submissions constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trobovic v. MSPB</span>, 232 Fed. Appx. 958, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), remanded an appeal to the Board after the court found that the AJ prematurely weighed competing evidence of jurisdiction through a summary jurisdictional disposition rather than through a hearing permitting resolution of evidentiary disputes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge first addressed Mr. Trobovic's allegation that he had been barred from his workplace for more than 14 days. If that allegation were proved, it would establish that Mr. Trobovic's absence from work was involuntary and that maintaining Mr. Trobovic in nonpay, nonduty AWOL status for failing to report for work was a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that Mr. Trobovic failed to make nonfrivolous allegations that he had been barred from his workplace. We disagree. On September 28, 2005, Mr. Trobovic filed a response to the administrative judge's order to show that the Board had jurisdiction. In that pleading, Mr. Trobovic stated that in late July 2005, he learned that his supervisor, GSA official Lloyd Wallace, had barred him from entering the federal building that is his workplace. He stated that he believed the bar was in retaliation for making protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) to senior GSA officials. The question whether a person has been barred from entering his or her workplace is not the sort of complex ultimate fact that needs more substantiation than Mr. Trobovic provided to be meaningfully evaluated for frivolousness. The allegation is not inherently implausible and cannot fairly be deemed frivolous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to that allegation, the GSA submitted an email from Mr. Wallace dated September 13, 2005, which informed Mr. Trobovic that he had never been barred from the building during normal working hours. The administrative judge apparently credited that email, or a declaration reciting its contents, as true. But that determination should have been reserved pending a jurisdictional hearing at which the administrative judge would have an opportunity to weigh and assess the credibility of the evidence. Because Mr. Trobovic had made a nonfrivolous factual allegation that would establish the Board's jurisdiction if true, the administrative judge erred in denying Mr. Trobovic's request for a hearing. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 437 F.3d 1322, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). We therefore vacate the Board's decision and remand for a hearing on Mr. Trobovic's claim that he was constructively suspended by being excluded from his workplace.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal was earlier filed and then dismissed for lack of evidence from the appellant that he was ready, willing, and able to work, the disposition of the appeal is not <span class="Italic">res</span> <span class="Italic">judicata</span> of a later appeal filed at a time when the appellant can present evidence that he is able to work. There is a difference in the facts in the two appeals, principally the proof that a recovery has occurred subsequent to the first appeal. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 107, 110 (1987).
