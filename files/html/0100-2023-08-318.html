<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rassenfoss v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RASSENFOSS_DAVID_O_CH_4324_13_0386_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1074162.pdf">121 MSPR 512</a>, 515-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-19, 2014 MSPB 68 (2014) (dissenting opinion of Member Robbins is reprinted following the majority opinion), modified or overruled preexisting law to require agencies to consider employees for benefits--a quality step increase--based on performance preceding military leave, following the employee's return to the workplace. While finding no discrimination based on military service against Mr. Rassenfoss from a uniformly applied agency policy precluding a rating for an employee who was absent from the agency during the rating period (and ineligible for a QSI), over the dissent of Member Robbins, the Board remanded the case for the AJ to consider, in accordance with Labor Department regulations, whether Mr. Rassenfoss was deprived of USERRA reemployment rights when he did not receive a QSI that the appellant asserted he likely would have received had he remained in agency employment rather than on military assignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311The appellant did not meet his burden to establish that the agency discriminated against him in violation of (a).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), a person who performs uniformed service may not be denied reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that service. An appellant raising a discrimination claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 bears the burden of proving that the contested agency decision was based on an improper motivation. <span class="Italic">Clavin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). The appellant claims the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his military service by designating him as "Not Ratable" and failing to award him a QSI in 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's manual regarding performance management explains that an employee is "Not Ratable" if: (1) he has less than 60 days performance under a signed performance plan during the appraisal year; (2) his appraisal period has ended; and (3) he is not in work status on the appraisal period ending date. A performance appraisal period may not be extended if the employee is not in work status on the appraisal period ending date. An agency Human Resources (HR) Specialist testified at the hearing that the appellant was properly designated as "Not Ratable" in 2010 because his extended absence began less than 60 days after the 2010 appraisal period began, the appraisal period ended while the appellant was still absent, and the appellant was not in a work status on the last day of the appraisal period. He further testified that he conducted a review of the agency's records and identified three employees who were absent for extended periods for reasons other than military service and, therefore, were designated as "Not Ratable." Moreover, he testified that he was unaware of any employees who met all three criteria to be designated as "Not Ratable" but were not so designated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Lead HR Specialist employed by the agency explained, in a declaration made under penalty of perjury, that "[e]mployees who receive a 'Not Ratable' designation on their current performance appraisals would not meet the threshold criterion [to qualify for a QSI], i.e., having received an 'Outstanding' rating of record on their current annual performance appraisal." She further explained that employees who are designated as "Not Ratable" on their current annual performance appraisal do not appear on a report of employees who are screened to determine their entitlement to a QSI. She asserted that this procedure is "consistently applied" and, therefore, no employee who received a "Not Ratable" designation on their current annual appraisal has been granted a QSI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has failed to prove that the agency discriminated against him based on his military service. He has produced no evidence establishing that the agency's policies concerning "Not Ratable" designations and eligibility for QSIs are applied inconsistently based on military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We remand this appeal for the administrative judge to adjudicate the appellant's USERRA reemployment claim.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges on review that the agency should have granted him a QSI in 2010 because, based on his "sustained outstanding performance record," including his "Outstanding" performance rating in 2009, this benefit of employment was reasonably certain to have been granted to him had he not been absent performing military service. The appellant also raised this argument below. He asserted on his initial appeal form and in his prehearing submission that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106, which, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, requires agencies to provide a mechanism by which employees who are absent because of uniformed service can be considered for promotions and other benefits of employment that were reasonably certain to have accrued but for the absence for military service. The administrative judge noted in her summary of the prehearing conference the appellant's argument "that had he remained at work it would have been reasonably certain he would have been awarded a QSI."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, in addition to a discrimination claim, the appellant raised a reemployment claim under USERRA. A reemployment claim arises under USERRA when an employee claims that an agency has not met its obligations under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 following his absence from civilian employment to perform uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Clavin</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 5. Unlike discrimination cases, an individual's rights under USERRA's reemployment provisions do not depend on the motivation for an agency's action (or inaction), and the agency bears the burden of proving that it met its statutory obligations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. Although the administrative judge concluded that the record did not support a finding that the agency violated the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA, she did not address the question of whether the agency met its burden to prove that it met its reemployment obligations under USERRA. Rather, she stated that the Board has jurisdiction over appeals of any person alleging discrimination in federal employment on account of prior military service and that the appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that his military service was a substantial and motivating factor in the agency's decision to deny him a benefit of employment. Thus, she appears to have analyzed only whether the appellant met his burden to establish his discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an administrative judge fails to adjudicate a claim that was properly raised below, it may be necessary to remand the appeal if the record is not sufficiently developed or if the administrative judge's error was prejudicial to a party's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 25 (2010) (when the record is sufficiently developed and the Board does not rely upon witness demeanor, the Board may adjudicate the case on the record and need not remand it to the administrative judge), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed.

Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision). We first turn to the question of whether the appellant was entitled to a QSI as part of the agency's obligations to restore him upon his return from military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_541"></span>USERRA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promulgate regulations governing its application to State and private employers. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4331(a). It similarly authorizes the Director of Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe implementing regulations applicable to federal agencies. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4331(b). However, the statute plainly provides that, in exercising this authority, the OPM Director must consult with the Secretaries of Labor and Defense, and that any resulting regulations "shall be consistent with the regulations pertaining to the States as employers and private employers, except that employees of the Federal Government may be given greater or additional rights." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM's regulation stipulates that "agencies have an obligation to consider employees absent on military duty for any incident or advantage of employment that they may have been entitled to had they not been absent." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c). It further instructs that this can be achieved by considering the following three factors: whether the benefit is generally granted to all employees; whether the employee is being treated the same as if he had remained at work; and whether it is reasonably certain that the benefit would have accrued to the employee but for the absence. Id<span class="Italic">.</span> In ascertaining the scope of a federal agency's obligation to a service member upon his or her return to the federal workforce, the Board has historically distinguished between benefits that are dependent on fitness, ability or the exercise of managerial discretion and those that are based on seniority, rewards for length of service, or would have accrued through the mere passage of time. <span class="Italic">West v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 24, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2011); <span class="Italic">Leite v. Department of the Army</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2008). Specifically, the Board has applied the "escalator principle" only to the latter category of benefits on the theory that these are the only benefits which would have been reasonably certain to have accrued during the employee's absence.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In the context of reemployment rights, the so-called "escalator principle" refers to the concept that an employee who has been absent due to military service or a work-related injury is entitled to be restored to the position that he or she would have attained but for the absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in 2005, the Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated USERRA regulations that conflict with the Board's precedent. Specifically, DOL rejected the discretionary/nondiscretionary distinction undergirding the Board's approach, and instead, directs employers to adopt a case-by-case approach to determine whether a benefit was reasonably certain to have accrued absent military service. 70 Fed. Reg. 75,246, 75,271. Under DOL's regulations, the reasonable certainty test applies to both discretionary and nondiscretionary benefits and personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For example, relevant factors to consider when assessing whether it is reasonably certain that an employee would have received a discretionary promotion include the returning employee's work history, his or her history of merit increases, and the work and pay history of employees in the same or similar position. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.236(a). We recognize that OPM regulations govern our adjudication of USERRA appeals of federal employees. However, given USERRA's express mandate that OPM's USERRA regulations be consistent with those issued by DOL, we believe that it would undermine Congress' intent for the Board to continue to interpret 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106[5] in a manner that is not only at odds with DOL's prescribed approach, but which affords service members returning to federal employment <span class="Italic">less</span> protection under USERRA than their State government and private sector counterparts. Therefore, to the extent that our holdings in <span class="Italic">West</span> and <span class="Italic">Leite</span> are premised on the assumption that discretionary personnel actions inherently fail the reasonable certainty test, they are hereby OVERRULED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In his dissent, Member Robbins argues that OPM's regulation governing the issuance of a QSI effectively precludes the consideration of such a benefit where the employee was absent during the rating period. However, this case is governed by OPM's USERRA regulations which entitle the appellant to any benefit which would have been reasonably certain to have accrued to him but for his military absence. The only question presented here is whether to interpret OPM's "reasonably certain" test in a manner consistent with DOL's USERRA regulations. We believe that USERRA on its face compels us to do so. Any potential resulting conflict with other OPM regulations is not for us to resolve.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not precedential and not binding upon us, we note that other federal courts have applied DOL's regulations concerning discretionary promotions and reached similar conclusions. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Sanford L.P</span>., No. 3:06-cv-466, 2008 WL 351227, at *7 (E.D. Tenn. Feb. 7, 2008), the defendant moved for summary judgment in a USERRA appeal concerning the employer's failure to provide a returning service member with a pay increase. In relevant part, the defendant argued that pay increases were awarded at the employee's supervisor's discretion after a performance evaluation and that the employee did not receive a performance evaluation while absent performing military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Applying 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.236, the District Court denied the defendant's motion, reasoning that the employee would have received a performance evaluation were it not for his military service and that a reasonable jury could conclude, based on his history of salary increases following performance evaluations, that he was reasonably certain to have received a pay increase were it not for his military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In particular, the employee had received raises in each of the three years immediately preceding his military service, as well as in the year immediately following the completion of his military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Talley v. Shaw Maintenance, Inc</span>., No. 1:11-cv-1044, 2012 WL 3961280, at *7 (W.D. Ark. Sept. 10, 2012), the District Court explicitly rejected the defendant's argument that merit-based pay raises cannot be reasonably certain for purposes of USERRA because their discretionary nature makes them inherently uncertain, noting that this argument overlooks the relevant factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.236 to determine whether a merit increase was reasonably certain to have occurred. The District Court thus denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that, because the employee had a long history of pay increases prior to his military leave and all of his co-workers received at least one merit-based pay raise during his absence, a question of fact existed as to whether he was reasonably certain to have received a pay increase if not for his military leave, and a jury could reasonably so conclude. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6-7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, there are some factors weighing in favor of finding that the appellant was reasonably certain to have received a QSI had he not been absent performing military service. The appellant's overall performance was rated as "Outstanding" in both 2008 and 2009--the two years immediately preceding his military absence. Further, when the appellant returned from military service, he again received an overall rating of "Outstanding" in 2011 and was offered a QSI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding these factors, we find it necessary to remand this appeal for further adjudication because we do not have sufficient information to reach a conclusion regarding the appellant's entitlement to a QSI as part of his restoration to duty. For instance, we have no information regarding the actual frequency with which QSI-eligible employees in the same or similar position as the appellant are granted or denied QSIs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in a USERRA appeal, an administrative judge should inform the parties of their respective burdens of proof and the type of evidence necessary to satisfy those burdens. <span class="Italic">Brasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 14 (2006). The administrative judge issued a jurisdictional order identifying the two types of USERRA claims and stating that, with respect to reemployment claims, the agency bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it met its statutory obligations under USERRA. However, she did not cite to or discuss the relevant provisions of 20 C.F.R. part 1002, so the agency was not notified of the information to be considered in determining whether a personnel action was reasonably certain to have occurred absent military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore remand this appeal to the Central Regional Office for further adjudication. If appropriate, the administrative judge may allow the parties limited discovery solely on the appellant's reemployment claim, and may conduct an additional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Robbins dissented in <span class="Italic">Rassenfoss</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I cannot subscribe to the notion that someone who was not given an annual performance rating due to an absence from the workplace (for whatever reason), could be assumed with reasonable certainty to have achieved a specific level of performance but for his absence. As is said in the financial investment community, "past performance is not a guarantee of future results."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inviting consideration of a reasonable certainty that the appellant would have received an outstanding rating but for his leave of absence to serve in the armed forces is contrary to uniformly applied agency policy and, in my opinion, neither required by law or regulation, nor consistent with good public policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For over a decade, the federal government has struggled to bring annual employee ratings back into the world of objective, standardized, measurable reality. Myriad studies illustrate the grade inflation that has infested this annual process over the years. Underlying this problem is the assumption that once a rating level is attained an employee's achievement remains at that level absent the emergence of astounding professional deficiencies in succeeding years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without questioning the ratings of the appellant's past professional performance, or an assumption that upon resuming his responsibilities he will again achieve an outstanding rating for his work, it is simply not possible to determine with reasonable certainty how he would have performed in his more than 1 year away from the agency. No one is outstanding always.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the majority opinion notes, the agency's manual regarding performance management explains that an employee is "Not Ratable" if: (1) he has less than 60 days performance under a signed performance plan during the appraisal year; (2) his appraisal period has ended; and (3) <span id="Page_542"></span>he is not in work status on the appraisal period ending date. This policy applies to all employees regardless of the reason for their absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority relies on regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor (DOL), and overrules agency policy and long-standing Board case law precedent, citing the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act's (USERRA) mandate that the DOL's and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) regulations on the subject must "be consistent." Yet, although likely not intentional, the DOL regulations are internally inconsistent, contrary to OPM regulations setting forth the criteria for granting quality step increases (QSIs), and at odds with the requirements of USERRA and the legislative intent behind them. And even without these shortcomings, I question the level of deference the Board owes to DOL regulations given the fact that appellants may bring USERRA actions either to the DOL or the Board, and if they come to the Board after exhausting the DOL process, we review the matter <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DOL regulations state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]f the employee is reemployed in the escalator position, the employer must compensate him or her at the rate of pay associated with the escalator position. The rate of pay must be determined by taking into account any pay increases, differentials, step increases, merit increases, or periodic increases that the employee would have attained with <span class="Italic">reasonable certainty</span> had he or she remained continuously employed during the period of service. In addition, when considering whether merit or performance increases would have been attained with reasonable certainty, an employer <span class="Italic">may</span> examine the returning employee's own work history, his or her history of merit increases, and the work and pay history of employees in the same or similar position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.236(a) (emphasis added). [1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;As the majority correctly notes, Majority Opinion, &#x00B6; 12 n.4, under the "escalator principle" concept, a returning service member "does not step back on the seniority escalator at the point he stepped off. He steps back on at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position continuously during the war." <span class="Italic">Tilton v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co</span>., 376 U.S. 169, 174 (1964). However, the escalator principle "moves" in both directions, because it also could mean that, but for the period of uniformed service, the employee could have been demoted, transferred, or laid off from his or her job, depending upon the circumstances. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.191.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree with the majority that these provisions have moved away from our historic focus on whether the action is discretionary or nondiscretionary. But the consideration of rate of pay following military service is still linked to reasonable certainty. In addition, the language regarding both merit increases and employee work history is permissive, not mandatory. In this case, the agency has considered this possibility and as a matter of policy has rejected it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following this permissive language, however, is a potentially ambiguous example: "if the employee missed a merit pay increase while performing service, but qualified for previous merit pay increases, then the rate of pay <span class="Italic">should</span> include the merit pay increase that was missed" (emphasis added). It is interesting that DOL uses the term "should" rather than the unequivocal terms "must" or "shall." Ambiguity is Avoided if "should" is "[u]sed to express conditionality or contingency,"[2] thereby denoting merely a guideline or recommendation whenever noncompliance with the specification is permissible. This definition is consistent with the permissive nature of the controlling DOL regulation language and unlike the alternative, does not completely abandon any element of reasonable certainty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Websters II New Riverside University Dictionary (1984) at 1078.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to DOL's confusing regulatory guidance are the regulations promulgated by OPM regarding QSIs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A quality step increase <span class="Italic">shall not be required</span> but may be granted only to--(a) An employee who receives a rating of [outstanding] ...or (b) An employee who, when covered by a <span class="Italic">performance appraisal program</span> that does not use [outstanding] --(1) Receives a rating of record at the highest summary level used by the program; and (2) Demonstrates sustained performance of high quality significantly above that expected at the "Fully Successful" level in the type of position concerned, as determined under <span class="Italic">performance-related criteria</span> established by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.504 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM regulations make clear that a QSI is not required under any circumstances. And when given it must be consistent with performance-related criteria in a performance appraisal program. An employee's absence from his or her position during the appraisal year precludes the performance of work-related responsibilities. In such a case there are no performance-related criteria to consider and there is no appraisal program to apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding regulatory deference, it seems to me we owe the same amount of deference to OPM regulations and Department of Treasury policy in this manner as we owe to conflicting regulatory guidance from the DOL. <span class="Italic">See Gose v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 451 F.3d 831, 840 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But finally, and in my opinion most persuasively, the statutory language and legislative intent of USERRA itself, and the history of its judicial and Board application, are clear and unambiguous, and under the circumstances need not be overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides that a person who performed uniformed service for more than 90 days is entitled to reemployment in the position in which he would have been employed if his continuous employment had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which he is qualified to perform. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A). A Senate Report indicates that section 4313 was intended to reaffirm the escalator principle as first enunciated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &#x0026; Repair Corp</span>., 328 U.S. 275, 284-85 (1946). S. Rep. No. 103-158, at 52 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Fishgold</span>, the Supreme Court explained that the escalator principle protects a returning service member from receiving "a job inferior to that which he had before entering the armed services."[3] 328 U.S. at 284. Thus, he must be restored without any loss of seniority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;While a returning service member is not expected to be placed in an inferior job, that does not mean he would be entitled to a promotion. <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad</span>, 357 U.S. 265, 272 (1958) (promotion to a new or vacant job for returning veteran was explicitly dependent not "simply on seniority or some other form of automatic progression" but also on "fitness and ability and the exercise of a discriminating managerial choice" and in keeping with the applicable collective bargaining agreement providing for bidding process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A related statutory provision provides that, with respect to "rights and benefits not determined by seniority," a returning service member is entitled to the same rights and benefits generally provided to employees having similar seniority, status and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Fishgold</span>, 328 U.S. at 284 (a returning service member shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence during his period of service, with all of the insurance and other benefits accruing to employees on furlough or leave of absence). Indeed, the Senate Report states that the escalator principle applies to perquisites of seniority, which may be determined by considering whether it is reasonably certain that the benefit would have accrued but for the military service and whether the benefit is a reward for length of service rather than a form of short-term compensation for services rendered. S. Rep. No. 103-158, at 57-58; <span class="Italic">see also Foster v. Dravo Corp</span>., 420 U.S. 92 (1975) (returning veteran not entitled to full vacation benefits for years in question, even though his failure to satisfy substantial work requirement upon which the benefits were conditioned was due to his serving in the military for portions of those years, as vacation benefits were intended as a form of short-term deferred compensation for work performed and the right to benefits did not accrue automatically as function of continued association with employer).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A QSI is not a perquisite of seniority. Under the agency's uniformly-applied policy, employees returning from extended leaves of absence, including for leave due to military service, are not considered for QSIs because they do not receive performance ratings for that period. Thus, the appellant is not entitled to a QSI because other employees who are on furlough or an extended leave of absence are not entitled to this benefit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">see also Rogers v. City of San Antonio</span>, 392 F.3d 758, 764 (5th Cir. 2004) ("USERRA does not grant escalator protection to service members' non-seniority rights and benefits but provides only that the employer treat employees absent because of military service equally with employees having similar seniority, status, and pay who are on comparable non-military leaves of absence")[4] <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.150 (the non-seniority rights and benefits to which an employee is entitled during a period of military service are those that the employer provides to similarly-situated employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Decisions by circuits other than the Federal Circuit are persuasive, but not controlling, authority before the Board. <span class="Italic">Gende v. Department of Justice</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 518, 523 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present matter, I would simply modify the initial decision to address the appellant's reemployment claim, and affirm the denial of the appellant's request for corrective action. I agree with the administrative judge's determination that "the appellant is entitled to a QSI on the same terms of any other employee who is on furlough or leave of absence." That is to say, he is not entitled to a QSI. Although the initial decision improperly analyzes the reemployment claim by omitting the agency's burden of proof and by conflating the discrimination and reemployment concepts, these errors were not harmful because the appellant was not entitled to a QSI. In so finding, we would not need to reach the question of whether <span class="Italic">Leite v. Department of the Army</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 229 (2008), and other Board case law must be overruled in light of the Department of Labor's 2005 regulations.</p>

Cir. 2016), <span class="Italic">post</span>), concluded that there was no entitlement to a discretionary position upgrade:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency, we note, avers that the appellant received the within-grade increase he was due. In contrast, the appellant's proposed position upgrade was not a generally granted benefit. As the incumbent in a position at the full performance level, he was not due a career-ladder promotion. Any upgrade affecting his position would have been discretionary and based upon the agency's needs. The agency may upgrade a position when no other employee or position can absorb the duties detailed in the position upgrade request. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(ii) ("Agencies may at their discretion except the following actions from competitive procedures of this section...(ii) A promotion resulting from an employee's position being classified at a higher grade because of additional duties and responsibilities...."). The position upgrade request here specifically stated that "[n]o other positions could absorb" the duties that the appellant was performing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for whether the position upgrade was reasonably certain but for the appellant's absence, we looked to the OPM regulation governing our adjudication of this issue, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c), and the Department of Labor (DOL) regulation covering nonfederal employees in <span class="Italic">Rassenfoss</span>. <span class="Italic">See Rassenfoss</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 512, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.236(a).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a valued employee who had done good work at the GS-11 and 12 grade levels. He received outstanding ratings for 2012, and prior years. As stated above, however, he and another employee were in GS-11 positions at the full performance level, unlike the employee who was promoted to GS-12. The office needed no additional GS-12 employees. The appellant's performance suffered after his return, which the agency documented, but the agency was still willing to promote him if a GS-12 position became available. The agency thus met its burden to prove that the appellant had not been denied any incident or advantage of employment to which he would have been entitled had he not been absent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit favored Hayden's position on review in <span class="Italic">Hayden v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 812 F.3d 1351, 1357-63 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The court added some background information. Before he left for military service, Hayden's supervisor requested an upgrade of his job to GS-12 through accretion of duties, requiring a desk audit. Hayden entered in his military duties and a position classifier explained to the supervisor that the audit required a personal interview of Mr. Hayden, and that could not be done because he was on extended military duty. Hayden's supervisor told him that the upgrade was canceled because he was in nonpay duty but that the process would be reengaged upon Hayden's return to civilian work. Before Hayden returned, however, the added duties that would have elevated the job to GS-12 were transferred to another unit, reducing the need for another GS-12 in Hayden's unit. When Hayden returned to the unit, management declined to upgrade his job, citing various reasons and alluding to his frequent absence for Reserve duties. On review, the Board found insufficient evidence linking Hayden's military duties and the decision not to upgrade his position. The Board relied on evidence showing that Hayden was unavailable for a desk audit while on military duty and that on his return there was no longer a need for the upgraded position. The court remanded the case for further factfinding after concluding that the Board incorrectly applied the burden shifting structure of the discrimination provision of USERRA, although there were no violations of the reemployment or retaliation provisions of the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees because of their military service, and affords certain protections to military service members with respect to their civilian employment. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).

<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>

U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting <span class="Italic">Petty v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville-Davidson Cty.</span>, 538 F.3d 431, 446 (6th Cir. 2008)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discriminatory motivation or intent "may be proven by either direct or circumstantial evidence." <span class="Italic">Sheehan,</span> 240 F.3d at 1014. In <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, we explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Discriminatory motivation under the USERRA may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. "In determining whether the employee has proven that his protected status was part of the motivation for the agency's conduct, all record evidence may be considered, including the agency's explanation for the actions taken." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an employee makes the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discriminatory motivation or intent, "the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the same action without regard to the employee's military service." <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368; <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1). "An employer therefore violates section 4311 if it would not have taken the adverse employment action but for the employee's military service or obligation." <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board found that "the agency considered [Hayden's] absences for Reserve duty when it decided not to process the upgrade request during his absence and not to pursue the upgrade upon his return." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 19. Weighing all of the evidence, the Board concluded "that the agency considered the appellant's military absences to be problematic, and the absences were a motivating factor in the agency's failure to provide the position upgrade." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Board found that Hayden satisfied his initial burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board then purported to shift the burden to the agency to demonstrate, by preponderant evidence, "that it would have taken the same action without considering his military service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 20 (citing <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368). The agency explained that it did not upgrade Hayden's position because: (1) the position classifier had the practice of conducting in-person desk audits for any position at the GS-12 level or above; and (2) by the time Hayden returned, the A Flight Protocol Office had a reduced workload. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21. The agency further argued that Hayden would have had to compete for the upgraded position, and that "the GS-12 employees from B Flight who had been declared as surplus would have had internal priority over the applicant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that, taken as a whole, "the evidence does not show that the agency denied the upgrade request because the appellant was on military duty. Instead, it shows that processing of the request was delayed because the appellant was temporarily unavailable for part of the consideration process and was on leave without pay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 25. The Board concluded that the "agency has thus shown that it decided not to pursue the upgrade both during and after the appellant's absence based on valid reasons other than the appellant's service in the Air Force Reserve. Accordingly, the agency met its burden of proof under section 4311(a)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Hayden contends that the Board failed to properly shift the burden to the agency to justify its actions in not promoting him and that, if it had, the agency could not have met its burden. In particular, Hayden argues that: (1) the Board erred in finding that a desk audit was required to process his position upgrade; (2) the Board erred in determining that he would have had to compete for the promotion; and (3) the Board's finding that the Protocol Office no longer needed GS-12 employees "is irrelevant because at the time Mr. Hayden's upgrade request was placed...there were not enough GS-12s to perform the duties of the office and thus [his] position needed to be upgraded." As explained below, we agree with Hayden that the Board did not hold the agency to its burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, as the Board noted, the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") Classifier's Handbook explains that a desk audit "is no more than a conversation [ ] or interview with the person in the job, <span class="Italic">or with the supervisor of the position</span>, or with both...to gain as much information as possible about the position." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 21. The position classifier testified that "she normally conducted an in-person desk audit when the upgraded position would have been at or above the GS-12 level." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is undisputed, however, that the decision to conduct a desk audit is discretionary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Indeed, Hayden's supervisor testified that "<span id="Page_544"></span>none of her prior position upgrade requests had required in-person desk audits" and that "she had participated in a telephonic audit for [Hayden's] position upgrade to GS-11." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board recognized that a desk audit was not necessary for Hayden's position upgrade, it nonetheless credited the agency's argument "that it was unable to complete the desk audit and process the upgrade because [Hayden] was unavailable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 20. The Board then concluded that the agency had shown that it denied the upgrade request in part because Hayden was "temporarily unavailable for part of the consideration process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 25. We agree with Hayden that his "inability to complete an optional procedure cannot form a legally cognizable basis to discriminate against him because of his military service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has made clear that an "employer cannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service." <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368. And we have recognized that "the overarching goal of [USERRA] is to prevent those who serve in the uniformed services from being disadvantaged by virtue of performing their military obligations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, the "most significant--and predictable--consequence of reserve service with respect to the employer is that the employee is absent to perform that service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although an agency is "entitled to remove an employee for prolonged non-military leaves of absence...'an employer can not treat employees on military duty like those on non-military leave of absence.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369 (quoting <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 142 F.3d 1444, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). <span class="Italic">Erickson</span> thus stands for the proposition that an employee's military absence cannot be held against him, and that employers cannot treat employees on military leave like those on nonmilitary leave of absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hayden was not available for an in-person desk audit precisely because he was performing his military obligations. That the agency may otherwise be entitled to cancel a position upgrade request when an employee on non-military leave fails to attend a requested interview is of no moment. <span class="Italic">See Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1369. The fact remains that Hayden was absent from work because of his military service, and USERRA protects against adverse employment actions resulting from such absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mere fact that the position classifier <span class="Italic">preferred</span> to conduct an in-person desk audit for an upgrade at or above the GS-12 level is irrelevant. Under <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, she was not entitled to impose that mere preference on a person who is on military leave. The bottom line is that an in-person desk audit was not required. To say that Hayden was not eligible for an upgrade because he was unavailable for a discretionary audit that could have been performed via telephone or by interviewing his immediate supervisor violates USERRA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1368 (permitting an employer to take an adverse action against an employee because of his military absence "would eviscerate the protections afforded by USERRA"). Accordingly, the Board erred in finding that the agency could avoid liability for failing to process the position upgrade request because Hayden was unavailable for an in-person desk audit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Hayden argues that the Board erred in determining that he was not entitled to a noncompetitive position upgrade at the time his supervisor requested the upgrade. In support, Hayden points out that OPM regulations give agencies discretion to except certain actions from competitive procedures. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3). One such exception is for a "promotion resulting from an employee's position being classified at a higher grade because of additional duties and responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(ii). Hayden also argues that he qualified for a noncompetitive upgrade under the Air Force's civilian staffing rules.[1] As the Board recognized, Hayden's supervisor submitted the upgrade request because he was performing additional duties and responsibilities at the GS-12 level and because there were "not enough GS-12's [sic] to perform the duties." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 4. Hayden submits that, in these circumstances, he was entitled to a noncompetitive position upgrade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Specifically, the Air Force Manual provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If a position is upgraded due to accretion/ assignment of additional higher grade duties and responsibilities, the incumbent may be noncompetitively promoted provided there is clear evidence that the employee continues to perform the same basic functions as in the former position, that there are no other employees serving in similar or identical positions to whom the duties could be assigned, and he/she meets all qualification and legal requirements for promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Air Force Manual 36-203: Staffing Civilian Positions, &#x00B6; 2.9.6 (Dec. 12, 2002) (Incorporating Change 1, June 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responds that, even if the agency proceeded with the upgrade request, Hayden would have had to compete for the GS-12 position. In particular, the agency submits that: (1) there was another GS-11 protocol specialist in the office who would have been eligible to compete; and (2) the surplus employee whose GS-12 position had been eliminated would have had priority over Hayden for any such position. According to the agency, the Board "properly determined that those employees' status constituted evidence supporting the agency's claim that it would not have promoted Mr. Hayden even if it had not considered his military absence when it decided not to upgrade the position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As counsel for the agency conceded at oral argument, the agency had the burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Hayden would have had to compete for the position upgrade and that he would not have received it, regardless of his military service. Careful review of the Board's decision reveals that it did not hold the agency to that burden, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of Hayden's discrimination claim, the Board merely noted the agency's argument that it could not upgrade the position noncompetitively because: (1) there were two protocol specialists at the GS-11 level, which would have triggered competition under the agency's regulations; and (2) even if the position were filled competitively, surplus employees "would have had internal priority over the appellant." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 20. In the next sentence, however, the Board stated that, "<span class="Italic">appellant thus could not show</span> he would have been placed automatically in the upgraded position or whether the position upgrade would have been approved." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). But the burden was not on Hayden to show he would have won any competition for the upgrade position. Having demonstrated that his military service was a motivating factor in the agency's decision to cancel his upgrade, Hayden satisfied his burden with respect to the discrimination claim, and the burden shifted to the agency to show it would not have processed the upgrade without regard to his military service. <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368; <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, we conclude that the Board failed to make sufficient factfindings with respect to: (1) whether Hayden would have had to compete for the position; and (2) whether he would have been successful in doing so. There are no findings as to whether the position could have been noncompetitively upgraded at the time the upgrade was requested. Nor is there any evidence or factfinding as to whether the surplused employee necessarily would have been chosen over Hayden. Although the Board states that Hayden would have had to compete for the upgraded position such that it "is not certain he would have been selected," those findings were in the context of Hayden's reemployment claim which, as discussed below, requires application of a different standard and different burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 29. The fact remains that, in the context of Hayden's <span class="Italic">discrimination</span> claim, the agency had the burden to show that its decision to cancel the upgrade request would have remained the same even if his military leave was not a factor. Because there is insufficient evidence that, had the agency processed the upgrade at the time it was requested, Hayden would have had to compete for the position and would not have won, we vacate the Board's decision and remand for further findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Hayden argues that the Board erroneously credited the agency's argument that the A Flight Protocol Office no longer needed additional GS-12 officers after Hayden's return. Specifically, he argues that reliance on this evidence was erroneous "because the changes to the Protocol Office's organizational structure occurred after the Air Force cancelled Mr. Hayden's position upgrade request."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the workload in the A Flight Protocol Office decreased in July 2012. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 5. Given this change, the Board found that, by the time Hayden returned to the office in December 2012, the office no longer needed additional GS-12 protocol officers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 25. Substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that, at the time Hayden returned to work, the agency had a legitimate reason for not upgrading Hayden's position to the GS-12 level. The record is devoid of evidence as to how long an upgrade request typically takes to process, however. The agency has not proven, accordingly, that, had the request gone forward in March 2012, Hayden would not have received the upgrade before the workload in the A Flight Protocol Office decreased. There is also no evidence as to how long any decrease in workload lasted, leaving largely unexplained why Hayden's upgrade was not renewed until so long after his return.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency could not use the discretionary in-person desk audit to justify its decision to cancel Hayden's upgrade request, and because the Board did not hold the agency to its burden with respect to competition at the time the request was made, we remand for further factfinding. Accordingly, we vacate the Board's decision with respect to Hayden's discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reemployment Claim</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA also provides service members protection in the form of a right to reemployment in their civilian jobs after completing their military obligations. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a). The regulations further provide that an agency "must consider employees absent on military duty for any incident or advantage of employment that they may have been entitled <span id="Page_545"></span>to had they not been absent." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c). The agency must therefore evaluate whether:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"the 'incident or advantage' is one generally granted to all employees in that workplace and whether it was denied solely because of absence for military service";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;"the person absent on military duty was treated the same as if the person had remained at work"; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;"it was reasonably certain that the benefit would have accrued to the employee but for the absence for military service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that Hayden was not entitled to reemployment at the GS-12 level when he returned from military leave. First, the Board found that Hayden could not establish that a position upgrade is a benefit generally granted to all agency employees. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 28. In reaching this conclusion, the Board explained, "[a]n example of a 'generally granted' benefit of employment is a within-grade increase, which is granted when an employee performing at the fully satisfactory level or better accrues a certain amount of time-in-grade." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Hayden, even if the position upgrade was not "an incident or advantage generally granted to all employees, as found by the MSPB, <span class="Italic">consideration</span> for a position upgrade is available to all employees." In support, Hayden argues that the agency "promoted another GS-11 Protocol Office employee, one who was not serving in the military, to a GS-12 position." The evidence Hayden cites does not establish that the agency failed to consider him for an upgrade, however. The agency explains, moreover, that the employee who was promoted had a position with a full performance level of GS-12, which meant that it was a personal, noncompetitive promotion, not a position upgrade. Importantly, there is no evidence that all employees are considered for position upgrades beyond their current performance levels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, because the A Flight Protocol Office lost its additional duties four months after the upgrade request, and after the B Flight Protocol Office placed two GS-12 protocol officers on surplus status, the Board could not determine what would have happened if Hayden had remained at work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 29. It concluded, however, that it was not "reasonably certain" that Hayden would have received the upgrade. Although Hayden was a valued employee with outstanding performance ratings, the Board found that "he and another employee were in GS-11 positions at the full performance level, unlike the employee who was promoted to GS-12." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 31. The Board further noted that Hayden's performance "suffered after his return, which the agency documented," but that it was still willing to promote him if a GS-12 position became available. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Hayden argues that the upgrade was "reasonably certain" given: (1) testimony from the position classifier that she was aware of only ten upgrade requests out of the hundreds that she had processed that were not granted; (2) his outstanding performance reviews; (3) his prior upgrade from GS-9 to GS-11; and (4) the fact that he was already performing GS-12 duties. Although Hayden disagrees with the Board's factfindings, we decline his invitation to reweigh the facts on appeal. Substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that the position upgrade is not a generally granted benefit and that it was not reasonably certain that Hayden would have received it, a showing that, in this context, was Hayden's burden to make. As such, we affirm the Board's decision with respect to Hayden's reemployment claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Retaliation Claim</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA prohibits retaliation against employees for exercising their rights under the statute. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). It provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter, (2) has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter, (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under this chapter, or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter. The prohibition in this subsection shall apply with respect to a person regardless of whether that person has performed service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The standard for a retaliation claim is the same as that for a discrimination claim: the employee must first establish that his protected actions were a motivating factor in the employer's adverse action, and then the burden shifts to the employer to establish that it would have taken the same action without regard to the employee's military service. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hayden argued that the agency retaliated against him for seeking assistance with the ESGR to enforce his USERRA rights. The Board found that Hayden failed to present any evidence "that the agency bore any discriminatory animus towards him and he thus failed to meet his initial burden of proof." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 33. To the contrary, the agency presented evidence that it did not need additional GS-12 Protocol Officers at the time, and that Hayden's supervisors "were concerned about helping him overcome a decline in his performance and prepare for eventual promotion to GS-12." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Hayden argues that the Board's retaliation analysis contradicts its finding that there was evidence the agency improperly considered his military service and that there was "animus based on his military service." But Hayden attempts to equate discrimination based on his military service--which is the basis for his first claim--with retaliation based on his attempt to enforce his USERRA rights. Although the two claims utilize the same standard, they stem from different events. Importantly, Hayden's retaliation claim is that his consultation with the ESGR about his USERRA rights after his return from military service prompted an immediate negative performance evaluation. The Board found, however, that Hayden "admitted at the hearing that the concerns [about his performance] did not lack foundation." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2014 WL 6879135, at &#x00B6; 7. The Board further found that Hayden's "performance suffered after his return, which the agency documented." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 31. Given these factfindings, substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that Hayden failed to meet his burden with respect to retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the Board that Hayden failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to his reemployment and retaliation claims under USERRA. With respect to his claim of discrimination based on military service, however, we vacate the Board's decision and remand for further factfinding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Rassenfoss</span>, interim promotions for those employees in military service were considered in <span class="Italic">Leite v. Dept. of Army</span>, 109 MSPR 229, 233-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14, 2008 MSPB 141 (2008), applying a test that considered advancement as a component of seniority as to whether an employee on military duty would have gained the skills, experience, and competitive edge for a position filled through competition during the employee's absence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A), an employee absent for more than 90 days for military duty is entitled to be restored, on her return, to "the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform...."[3] Courts have interpreted this provision, and its successor provisions, as incorporating the "escalator principle." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rogers v. City of San Antonio,</span> 392 F.3d 758, 763 (5th Cir. 2004). Under this principle, an employee returning from military service "step[s] back on the seniority escalator [not] at the point he stepped off, [but] at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position continuously during the war." <span class="Italic">Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &#x0026; Repair Corp.,</span> 328 U.S. 275, 284-85 (1946).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As the administrative judge indicated, the agency has the burden of proving that it complied with this provision. <span class="Italic">See Clavin v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 6 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on this "escalator principle," the appellant in this case argues that, if she had not been absent for military duty from 2003 to 2006, she would have remained in her former position; that she likely would have been promoted based on the addition of new duties to the position; and that, even if the position had been filled competitively after the addition of those duties, she likely would have been detailed to it and subsequently selected for it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts applying the "escalator principle" have held that, under some circumstances, employees who were passed over for advancement while on military duty may be entitled to retroactive advancement after returning to their civilian employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tilton v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co.,</span> 376 U.S. 169, 174-81 (1964); <span class="Italic">Goggin v. Lincoln St. Louis,</span> 702 F.2d 698, 702-04 (8th 1983). Moreover, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that a returning employee is required to show the "absolute foreseeability" of his advancement in order to establish his entitlement to it. <span class="Italic">Tilton,</span> 376 U.S. at 179-80. That Court and others, however, have drawn a distinction between "perquisites of seniority," where the advancement or other benefit was dependent on continuing employment, and situations in which the advancement or other benefit was "dependent on fitness and ability and the exercise of a discriminating managerial choice." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 179 <span class="Italic">(quoting McKinney v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co.,</span> 357 U.S. 265, 272 (1958)); <span class="Italic">see Batayola v. Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle,</span> 798 F.2d 355, 357 (9th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Goggin,</span> 702 F.2d at 701 (one test for determining whether a benefit or promotion is a "perquisite of seniority" is whether "the nature of the benefit [is] a reward for length of service rather than a form of short-term compensation for services rendered"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 701-03 (in finding the employee entitled to retroactive promotion, the court referred to a finding that no experience was necessary to advance, to evidence that the opportunity to advance accrued on the basis of seniority alone through the "mere passage of time," and to the absence of any indication that the employees promoted in the veteran's absence had more ability than the veteran or had been given any tests that the veteran could not have successfully passed). They also have held <span id="Page_546"></span>that the benefits to be granted under the "escalator principle" must have been reasonably certain to have accrued in the employee's absence, and that a showing that advancement was based on fitness and ability was inconsistent with a finding that the "reasonable certainty" test was satisfied. <span class="Italic">E.g., Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp.,</span> 447 U.S. 191, 197 (1980); <span class="Italic">Alabama Power Co. v. Davis,</span> 431 U.S. 581, 587 (1977); <span class="Italic">Batayola,</span> 798 F.2d at 357; <span class="Italic">Goggin,</span> 702 F.2d at 701; <span class="Italic">see also Tilton,</span> 376 U.S. at 178 (in finding the employees entitled to retroactive advancement, the Court referred to the promotions the employees received on completion of their training periods as "automatic").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear that advancement to the GS-14 Financial Manager position was not a "perquisite of seniority," a reward for length of service, or a benefit that would have accrued to the appellant through the "mere passage of time." As the administrative judge explained in his initial decision, the position was filled competitively, after the agency had considered the relative abilities of qualified candidates. As the administrative judge noted further, the appellant was in fact considered for the position, but another candidate was selected, based on management's conclusion that she was better qualified for it than the appellant and the other candidates were. The appellant nevertheless argues, as noted above, that she would likely have been promoted to the GS-14 position but for her military service. In support of this argument she asserts that the person selected for that position had been serving in the appellant's former position while the appellant was absent for military service. She also states that other employees were promoted following the addition of duties to their positions, that she had received exemplary performance evaluations, and that testimony presented at the hearing indicated that agency officials liked to "maintain continuity" of personnel in the position, and were likely to select employees who were already performing, if only on a temporary basis, the duties of the positions being filled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot determine whether the appellant would have been assigned the added duties of the GS-14 Financial Manager position if she had not been absent for military service. We also cannot determine whether, if the appellant had performed those duties on a temporary basis, her qualifications for promotion to the position would have been significantly enhanced, and her prospects for promotion improved. In short, we cannot rule out the possibility that the appellant would have been promoted to the GS-14 position but for her military service. However, we know of no basis for requiring an agency to consider an absent employee for promotion as though she had the experience and skills she might have obtained if she had continued her civilian employment and had been assigned, on a temporary basis, the duties of the position at issue. On the contrary, the Supreme Court has held that reemployment provisions such as those applicable here do not assure the returning employee "a perfect reproduction of the civilian employment that might have been his if he had not been called to the colors," and that they do "not assure him that the past with all its possibilities of betterment will be recalled." <span class="Italic">McKinney,</span> 357 U.S. at 271-72; <span class="Italic">see also Goggin,</span> 702 F.2d at 701 <span class="Italic">(quoting McKinney).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not show, with reasonable certainty, that the appellant would have been promoted to the GS-14 Financial Manager position but for her military service. By considering the appellant for promotion to the GS-14 Financial Manager position that was filled in her absence, and by restoring her in February 2007 to a position whose "seniority, status, and pay" were like those of the position she held when she began her active military service in 2003, the agency afforded the appellant her rights under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly overruled by <span class="Italic">Rassenfoss</span>, <span class="Italic">West v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEST_MISTY_J_AT_4324_10_0736_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_646401.pdf">117 MSPR 24</a>, 25-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9, 2011 MSPB 88 (2011), considered the escalator principle but concluded there was no entitlement to promotion while the appellant was in military status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June 2002, the agency appointed the appellant to the position of GS-07 Information Technology (IT) Specialist through the Palace Acquire Outstanding Scholars Program. In August 2005 the appellant completed that internship and the agency reassigned her to a permanent GS-11 IT Specialist position. Beginning March 19, 2007, the agency placed the appellant in leave without pay status because she was called to active military duty. Following her active duty, the appellant returned to the agency effective March 1, 2010, in the position of GS-11 IT Specialist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal in which she contended that the agency violated her reemployment rights under USERRA. Specifically, she argued that, based on the experiences of her peers in the internship program, the agency would have promoted her to GS-12 had she not left on active duty. The appellant also argued that the agency realigned her position such that she was essentially made to take a step backward upon her return from active duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding a hearing, the administrative judge denied the appellant's request for corrective action. The administrative judge found that the agency reemployed the appellant in the same GS-11 IT Specialist position that she held in March 2007 before she left for military service. The administrative judge also found that promotions from GS-11 to GS-12 were not a "perquisite of seniority" but instead depended on management's discretion in filling a competitive position. Thus, the administrative judge determined that the agency properly reemployed the appellant upon her return from active duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With exceptions not pertinent here, USERRA provides that an employee returning from uniformed service of more than 90 days shall be reemployed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A) in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service, <span class="Italic">or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the agency may comply with the plain language of the statute by reemploying the employee <span class="Italic">either</span> in the position the employee would have held had she not left for uniformed service, <span class="Italic">or</span> a position of like seniority, status, and pay for which she is qualified. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency placed the appellant in the position that she held prior to her active uniformed service, with all step increases and annual salary adjustments that she would have received had she not been called up to active duty. She therefore concluded that the agency reemployed the appellant in the position she would have held but for her uniformed service. In her petition for review, the appellant reiterates her argument below that the agency should have promoted her to GS-12 upon her return from active duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency reemploys an employee in the position she would have held absent her uniformed service, the agency must, under the escalator principle, provide the employee with "any incident or advantage of employment that [the employee] may have been entitled to had they not been absent." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c). Courts have found that an employee returning from uniformed service should be reemployed at a higher grade than she held when she left civilian employment if advancement to the higher grade was a perquisite of seniority, a reward for length of service, or a benefit that would have accrued through the mere passage of time. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tilton v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co.</span>, 376 U.S. 169, 174-81 (1964); <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Missouri-Kansas R. Co.</span>, 357 U.S. 265, 272 (1958); <span class="Italic">Goggin v. Lincoln St. Louis</span>, 702 F.2d 698, 701 (8th Cir. 1983). Although it need not be absolutely foreseeable, such advancement "must have been reasonably certain to have accrued in the employee's absence." <span class="Italic">Leite v. Department of the Army</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). Advancement is not reasonably certain if it is dependent on the exercise of "a discriminating managerial choice" and the fitness and ability of the employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the evidence did not indicate that the appellant's promotion was a perquisite of seniority, a reward for length of service, or a benefit that would have accrued through the mere passage of time. In that regard, the administrative judge found that the appellant's peers from the internship program "were promoted through the competitive process, which required for management to exercise its discretion in the selection." Further, as noted in <span class="Italic">Leite</span>, there is no basis for requiring an agency to consider an absent employee for promotion as though she had the experience and skills she might have obtained if she had continued her civilian employment. <span class="Italic">Leite</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 13. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency was not required to promote the appellant to GS-12 upon her return from active military service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The obligation under USERRA to consider individuals in military service for bid assignments when that consideration would ordinarily be extended to absent employees was noted in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dept. of State</span>, 106 MSPR 583, 588-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17, 2007 MSPB 214 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that the administrative judge found that the appellant was entitled under USERRA to be considered for the assignments for which he had bid in August 2005. To the extent this finding was based on the appellant's reemployment rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313, rather than on the appellant's claim of discrimination under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, we VACATE it, as indicated above. We also note, however, that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 prohibits an employer from denying "any benefit of employment...on the basis of" the employee's performance of uniformed service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). Participation in the agency's bidding process falls within USERRA's broad definition of a "benefit of employment."[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;USERRA provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The term "benefit," "benefit of employment," or "rights and benefits" means any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (other than wages or salary for work performed) that accrues by reason of an employment <span id="Page_547"></span>contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan, a health plan, an employee stock ownership plan, insurance coverage and awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacations, and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency's petition for review was pending before the Board, our reviewing court issued a decision addressing an arguably similar claim. In <span class="Italic">Tully v. Department of Justice</span>, 481 F.3d 1367, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the court held that USERRA's prohibition against the denial of a benefit of employment on the basis of an employee's military service did not entitle an employee who was absent for military duty to preferential treatment. The absent employee was entitled instead to benefits that were comparable to "the benefits associated with absences similar to the service member's." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1370. Factors such as the length of an absence were "proper grounds for assessing similarity," and the difference between the expected duration of an employee's military leave and the expected duration of another kind of leave could be relevant in determining whether an employee absent for military duty was entitled to a certain benefit of employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Tully</span> suggests that the appellant in this case was entitled, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, to the same treatment with respect to bid assignments that the agency affords other employees on extended leaves of absence. This principle is based on and consistent with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b), which provides that an employee who is absent for military duty shall be carried in a furlough or leave-of-absence status, and is "entitled to such other rights and benefits not determined by seniority as are generally provided by the employer of the person to employees having similar seniority, status, and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence under a contract, agreement, policy, practice, or plan." In sum, if the agency considers the assignment bids of employees on absences comparable to the appellant's absence for military duty, then the agency may have denied the appellant a benefit of employment in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311.</p>
