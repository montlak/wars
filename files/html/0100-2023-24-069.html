<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-66"><span class="space">3.</span> Jurisdictional Issue; Constructive Adverse Action; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Perry</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perry v. MSPB</span>, 137 S. Ct. 1975, 1979-88 (2017) (Justices Gorsuch and Thomas dissenting), determined that if a mixed case is dismissed for jurisdictional reasons, review is in a district court, not in the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Perry</span> involved an appeal from a constructive removal--a forced retirement--coupled with allegations of discrimination. The review process was initiated in the D.C. Circuit. That circuit, in turn, ordered transfer of the case to the Federal Circuit. Appeal from the D.C. Circuit's decision led to the Supreme Court decision effectively transferring the case to a district court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a complaint presents a mixed case, and the MSPB dismisses it, must the employee resort to the Federal Circuit for review of any civil-service issue, reserving claims under federal antidiscrimination law for discrete district court adjudication? If the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on the merits, the parties agree, review authority lies in district court, not in the Federal Circuit. In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 568 U. S., at 50, 56, we held, the proper review forum is also the district court when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds, in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> itself, failure to meet a deadline for Board review set by the MSPB. We hold today that the review route remains the same when the MSPB types its dismissal of a mixed case as "jurisdictional." As in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, we are mindful that review rights should be read not to protract proceedings, increase costs, and stymie employees, but to secure expeditious resolution of the claims employees present. <span class="Italic">See Elgin v. Department of Treasury</span>, 567 U. S. 1, 15 (2012) (emphasizing need for "clear guidance about the proper forum for [an] employee's [CSRA] claims"). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. l.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7703(b) designates the proper forum for judicial review of MSPB decisions. Section 7703(b)(1)(A) provides the general rule: "[A] petition to review a... final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit." Section 7703(b)(2) states the exception here relevant, governing "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [&#x00A7;] 7702." <span class="Italic">See Kloeckner</span>, 568 U. S., at 46 ("The 'cases of discrimination' in &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s exception... are mixed cases, in which an employee challenges as discriminatory a personnel action appealable to the MSPB."). Such cases "shall be filed under [the enforcement sections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>], as applicable." &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). Those enforcement provisions "all authorize suit in federal district court." <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 568 U. S., at 46 (citing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-16(c), 2000e-5(f); 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(c); &#x00A7; 216(b)). Thus, if the MSPB decides against the employee on the merits of a mixed case, the statute instructs her to seek review in federal district court under the enforcement provision of the relevant antidiscrimination laws. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2); <span class="Italic">see Kloeckner</span>, 568 U. S., at 56, n.4.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_5256"></span>[3]&#x2003;Our decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 568 U. S. 41 (2012), did not merely assume that the civil-service component of mixed cases travels to district court. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at 56, n.4 ("If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an agency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit <span class="Italic">will</span> come to district court for a decision <span class="Italic">on both questions</span>." (emphasis added)). <span class="Italic">But see post</span>, at 9-10. Characteristic of "mixed cases," the employee in Kloeckner complained of adverse action taken, at least in part, because of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 568 U. S., at 47. The Board dismissed that case, not for any flaw under antidiscrimination law, but because the employee missed a deadline set by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at 47-48.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal district court is also the proper forum for judicial review, we held in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 50, 56. We rested that conclusion on this syllogism: "Under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), 'cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702] ' shall be filed in district court." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 50 (alteration in original). Further, "[u]nder &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), [mixed cases qualify as] 'cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702] .'" <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. (third alteration in original). Thus, "mixed cases shall be filed in district court." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. That syllogism, we held, holds true whether the dismissal rests on procedural grounds or on the merits, for "nowhere in the [CSRA's] provisions on judicial review" is a distinction drawn between MSPB merits decisions and procedural rulings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 51. The instant case presents this question: Where does an employee seek judicial review when the MSPB dismisses her civil-service case alleging discrimination neither on the merits nor on a procedural ground, but for lack of jurisdiction?</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to review the D.C. Circuit's decision, 580 U. S. __, 137 S. Ct. 811 (2017), which accords with the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Bd</span>., 713 F. 3d 1111 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We announced a clear rule in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>: "[M]ixed cases shall be filed in district court." 568 U. S., at 50. An employee brings a mixed case, we explained, when she "complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB," e.g., suspension for more than 14 days, &#x00A7; 7512(2), "and alleges that the action was based on discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 44 (emphasis deleted). The key to district court review, we said, was the employee's "<span class="Italic">clai[m]</span> that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 56 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">EEOC regulations, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, at 3, are in accord: The defining feature of a "mixed case appeal," those regulations instruct, is the employee's "<span class="Italic">alleg[ation]</span> that an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2) (2016) (emphasis added). Several Courts of Appeals have similarly described mixed-case appeals as those <span class="Italic">alleging</span> an adverse action subject to MSPB jurisdiction taken, in whole or in part, because of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See, e.g., Downey v. Runyon</span>, 160 F. 3d 139, 143 (CA2 1998) ("Mixed appeals to the MSPB are those appeals <span class="Italic">alleging</span> an appealable action affected in whole or in part by prohibited discrimination." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 158 F. 3d, at 597 (defining mixed-case appeal as "an <span class="Italic">appeal</span> alleging both a Board-jurisdictional agency action and a claim of unlawful discrimination" (emphasis added)). <span class="Italic">See also Conforto</span>, 713 F. 3d, at 1126-1127, n.5 (Dyk, J., dissenting).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our interpretation is also consistent with another CSRA provision, &#x00A7; 7513(d), which provides that "[a]n employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the... Board." Because the "entitle[ment] to appeal" conferred in &#x00A7; 7513(d) must be determined before an appeal is filed, such a right cannot depend on the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Perry "complain[ed] of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB" (in his case, a 30-day suspension and involuntary removal, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, at 6; &#x00A7; 7512(1), (2)) and "allege[d] that the [personnel] action was based on discrimination," he brought a mixed case. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 568 U. S., at 44.[5] Judicial review of such a case lies in district court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 50, 56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;If, as the dissent and the Government argue, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 8-10; Brief for Respondent 19-26, 33-35, Perry's case is not "mixed," one can only wonder what kind of case it is, surely not one asserting rights under the CSRA only, or one invoking only antidiscrimination law. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 1-2. This is, of course, a paradigm mixed case: Perry alleges serious personnel actions (suspension and forced retirement) caused in whole or in part by prohibited discrimination. So did the employee in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>. She alleged that her firing (a serious personnel action) was based on discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 568 U. S., at 47. Thus Perry, like Kloeckner, well understood what the term "mixed case" means.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A procedure-jurisdiction distinction for purposes of determining the court in which judicial review lies, as both parties recognized in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, would be perplexing and elusive. If a 30-day suspension followed by termination becomes nonappealable to the MSPB when the Board credits a release signed by the employee, one may ask why a determination that the employee complained of such adverse actions (suspension and termination) too late, i.e., after a Board-set deadline, does not similarly render the complaint nonappealable. In both situations, the Board disassociates itself from the case upon making a threshold determination. This Court, like others, we note, has sometimes wrestled over the proper characterization of timeliness questions. <span class="Italic">Compare Bowles v. Russell</span>, 551 U. S. 205, 209-211, 215 (2007) (timely filing of notice of appeal in civil cases is "jurisdictional"), with <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 217-219 (Souter, J., dissenting) (timeliness of notice of appeal is a procedural issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as the proper characterization of a question as jurisdictional rather than procedural can be slippery, the distinction between jurisdictional and merits issues is not inevitably sharp, for the two inquiries may overlap. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F. 3d 1336, 1341 (CA Fed. 2001) ("recogniz[ing] that the MSPB's jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged involuntary separation are inextricably intertwined" (internal quotation marks omitted))....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Distinguishing between MSPB jurisdictional rulings and the Board's procedural or substantive rulings for purposes of allocating judicial review authority between district court and the Federal Circuit is problematic for a further reason: In practice, the distinction may be unworkable. The MSPB sometimes rules on alternate grounds, one typed "jurisdictional," another either procedural or substantive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davenport v. Postal Service</span>, 97 MSPR 417 (2004) (dismissing "for lack of jurisdiction and as untimely filed" (emphasis added)). To which court does appeal lie? Or, suppose that the Board addresses a complaint that encompasses multiple claims, dismissing some for want of jurisdiction, others on procedural or substantive grounds. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Donahue v. Postal Service</span>, 2006 WL 859448, *1, *3 (ED Pa., Mar. 31, 2006). Tellingly, the Government is silent on the proper channeling of appeals in such cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Desirable as national uniformity may be,[11] it should not override the expense, delay, and inconvenience of requiring employees to sever inextricably related claims, resorting to two discrete appellate forums, in order to safeguard their rights. Perry's comprehension of the complex statutory text, we are persuaded, best serves "[t]he CSRA's objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined" by "parallel litigation regarding the same agency action." <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 567 U. S., at 14. <span class="Italic">See also United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U. S. 439, 444-445 (1988).[12] Perry asks us not to "tweak" the statute, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 1, but to read it sensibly, i.e., to refrain from reading into it the appeal-splitting bifurcation sought by the Government. Accordingly, we hold: (1) the Federal Circuit is the proper review forum when the MSPB disposes of complaints arising solely under the CSRA; and (2) in mixed cases, such as Perry's, in which the employee (or former employee) complains of serious adverse action prompted, in whole or in part, by the employing agency's violation of federal antidiscrimination laws, the district court is the proper forum for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, we rejected the Government's national uniformity argument. <span class="Italic">See</span> 568 U. S., at 55-56, n.4. "When Congress passed the CSRA, the Federal Circuit did not exist," we observed, so uniformity did not then figure in Congress' calculus. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 56, n.4. Moreover, even under the Government's reading, "many cases involving federal employment issues [would be resolved] in district court. If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an agency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit will come to district court for a decision on both questions." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;In both <span class="Italic">Elgin v. Department of Treasury</span>, 567 U. S. 1 (2012), and <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U. S. 439 (1988), we rejected employees' attempts to divide particular issues or claims among review forums. In <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, a federal employee opted not to seek review of an MSPB ALJ's decision, either before the full Board or in the Federal Circuit; he instead brought in District Court, in the first instance, a constitutional challenge to an agency personnel action. 567 U. S., at 7-8. We concluded that an employee with civil-service claims must follow the CSRA's procedures and may not bring a standalone constitutional challenge in district court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 8. In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, a federal employee with CSRA claims filed an action in the United States Claims Court under the Back Pay Act of 1966. 484 U. S., at 443. We determined that the employee could not bring his action under the Back Pay Act because the CSRA provided "the comprehensive and integrated review scheme." <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at 454. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 10, neither case indicated that the Federal Circuit, as opposed to district court, is the preferred forum for judicial review of all CSRA claims. Rather, both decisions emphasized the benefits of an integrated review scheme and the problems associated with bifurcating consideration of a single matter in different forums. <span class="Italic">See</span> 567 U. S., at 13-14; 484 U. S., at 444-445.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5257"></span>Until <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, <span class="Italic">Conforto v. MSPB</span>, 713 F.3d 1111, 1113-23 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (Judge Dyk dissenting), affirmed preexisting practice and law in the Federal Circuit, and reflected the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-184_5ifl.pdf">133 S. Ct. 596</a> (2012), by determining that the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review a jurisdictional dismissal by the Board of a constructive adverse action appeal that asserts discrimination or reprisal as a basis for the allegedly forced resignation or retirement--perpetuating the mixed-case appeal process created by the Reform Act's split of authority between MSPB and EEOC over appealable actions with EEO affirmative defenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Conforto worked for the Department of the Navy until she retired on December 31, 2010. At the time of her retirement, she had worked in the Department for 39 years and held the position of Supervisory Contract Specialist in the Material Management Department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Conforto alleges that she was forced to retire at the end of 2010 because of a series of events that occurred at her workplace during the previous year. She contends that those events were motivated by age and sex discrimination, as well as retaliation for her prior equal employment opportunity ("EEO") activity. The particular incidents about which she complained are the following: in December 2009, her parking space was taken away; in March 2010, one of her subordinates was promoted to a vacated position instead of her; in April 2010, she was denied permission to attend a training session; and in July 2010, she felt pressured into canceling a training session that she had planned to attend. In September 2010, following those events, Ms. Conforto advised her agency's human resources office that she wished to retire as of December 31 of that year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the months after Ms. Conforto submitted her retirement papers but before her retirement became effective, several more events occurred that she alleges were the products of discrimination or retaliation. In October 2010, her supervisor criticized her work progress by email and then issued her a formal letter of reprimand. In November 2010, Ms. Conforto alleges, her supervisor denied her request for sick leave, and in December he issued her a notice proposing to suspend her for seven days. Finally, she complains that after her retirement the agency issued her a letter charging her with improperly copying materials from her work computer, gave her a negative interim appraisal for the year 2010, and did not give her a bonus or raise for that year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As these events unfolded, Ms. Conforto filed an EEO complaint with her agency in June 2010, alleging discrimination based on age and sex as well as reprisal for prior EEO activity. She later amended her EEO complaint to allege that she had been forced to retire because of harassment. In October 2011, the agency issued its decision on Ms. Conforto's EEO complaint. Following a detailed factual analysis of her claims, the agency concluded that Ms. Conforto had not been subjected to discrimination or retaliation and that she had retired voluntarily, not because of discriminatory or retaliatory conduct by agency personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Conforto appealed the agency's decision to the Board in December 2011. The administrative judge who was assigned to her case issued an order advising her that the Board might not have jurisdiction over her appeal because retirement is presumed to be a voluntary act. Under this court's <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decisions in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 1991), and <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the Board lacks jurisdiction over an employee's voluntary decision to resign or retire. In response to the administrative judge's order, Ms. Conforto replied that the Board had jurisdiction over her appeal because her retirement was the product of coercion by the agency. As such, she contended, her involuntary retirement constituted a constructive removal and thus fell within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1); 7513(a), (d); 7701(a); <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1328-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed Ms. Conforto's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. According to the administrative judge, Ms. Conforto had failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her retirement was involuntary, and thus she was not entitled to a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction. Analyzing Ms. Conforto's allegations, the administrative judge found that even the most serious actions of which she complained--the letter of reprimand and the proposed seven-day suspension--could not support a claim of coerced retirement because they did not leave her without any reasonable alternative but to retire. In addition, the administrative judge noted that Ms. Conforto had not alleged any facts suggesting that the agency knew it could not justify those actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge pointed out that the agency had provided a detailed analysis of Ms. Conforto's allegations and had concluded that there was a legitimate basis for each of the actions of which she complained. According to the administrative judge, Ms. Conforto had "not made any specific factual allegations to call these conclusions into question." Moreover, the administrative judge noted that the most serious actions--the letter of reprimand and the proposed suspension--occurred after September 2010, when Ms. Conforto advised the agency that she would retire as of the end of the year. The timing of those incidents, according to the administrative judge, "undercut[&#8197;] any assertion that her retirement was prompted by" those events. In sum, the administrative judge concluded that while Ms. Conforto alleged that she felt subjectively that she had no choice but to retire, "the circumstances she alleges would not make a reasonable person believe that she had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire." The administrative judge ruled that Ms. Conforto had failed to make a non-frivolous showing that the agency had coerced her into retiring and thus that she had failed to satisfy her burden of showing that her retirement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge's initial decision became final, Ms. Conforto appealed to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first issue we must address is whether this court has jurisdiction to review the Board's ruling under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Resolving that question requires a brief discussion of the options open to a federal employee complaining of discrimination in the workplace. First, the employee may file an EEO complaint with the employing agency; if the employee does so, the agency is obligated to investigate and take final action on the complaint. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.101-110. If dissatisfied with the agency's resolution of the complaint, the employee may bring an action in a United States district court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1614.407. In the case of discrimination based on race or sex, that action would be brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c). In the case of age discrimination, that action would be brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(c). Alternatively, the employee may appeal the agency's decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), and then to a district court. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.401-405. In certain cases, the employee has a third option--to file an appeal from the employing agency's final action to the Merit Systems Protection Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1614.302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board is available only in cases in which the adverse action in question falls within the Board's jurisdiction, such as in the case of removal or suspension for more than 14 days. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a), (d), 7701(a). If the Board has jurisdiction to review an agency action against an employee, Congress has also authorized it to adjudicate the employee's claims of discrimination that would otherwise fall outside the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302; <span class="Italic">see Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1335. Such a case is referred to as a "mixed case appeal." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). By alleging forced retirement in addition to her discrimination claims, Ms. Conforto sought to bring her case before the Board as a mixed case appeal in which the Board would review both the adverse employment action and the related discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee loses her mixed case appeal on the merits of her discrimination claim, she may obtain further review of the adverse decision, either from a district court or from the EEOC and then (if necessary) a district court, but not from this court. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(a)(3), 7703(b)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.303-310. That much is clear from the statutes and regulations pertaining to mixed case appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is now equally clear that the district court's jurisdiction would also extend to review of a mixed case appeal that the Board dismissed on procedural grounds, such as untimeliness. That is the holding of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>. As a result, the district court, and not this court, is charged with jurisdiction over any mixed case appeal that the Board resolves either on the merits or on procedural grounds. That in effect means that any case in which the Board exercises its jurisdiction to decide a discrimination claim, and in which the employee seeks review of that decision, is not appealable to this court. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1348 n.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case requires us to decide what court has reviewing authority when the Board decides that it does not have jurisdiction over an appeal because the challenged agency action is not within the Board's statutory power to review. Before <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, we consistently held that judicial review of the Board's "no jurisdiction" rulings resides in this court. Even though Ms. Conforto filed her appeal in this court, she now argues, based on <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, that this court lacks jurisdiction over her appeal and that her case should be transferred to a district court. After close consideration of the <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> decision and a careful review of the statutes that govern mixed case appeals, we conclude that this court has jurisdiction to review a determination by the Board that it lacks statutory jurisdiction over an employee's appeal. That category includes the Board's decision that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Conforto's appeal because her retirement was voluntary and therefore did not constitute an "adverse action" within the meaning of section 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For years, we have held that appeals such as Ms. Conforto's must come to this court. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 738 F.2d 1244, 1247-48 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see Oja v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 405 F.3d 1349, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Lang v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 219 F.3d 1345, 1347 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Austin v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 136 F.3d 782, 784 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994110521f3d10841918">21 F.3d 1084</a>, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 728 F.2d 1456, 1458-59 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 725 F.2d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The court held that appeals should be taken to this court not only <span id="Page_5258"></span>in cases that the Board dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but also in cases in which the Board exercised jurisdiction over the appeal but disposed of it on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of the employee's discrimination claim. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, this court noted that section 7702(a)(1) requires the Board to decide "both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action." 738 F.2d at 1246. The court then reasoned that under the statutory scheme, "the judicially reviewable action by the MSPB which makes an appeal a 'case of discrimination' under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) that can be filed in district court is that the MSPB has decided 'both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, the court concluded, judicial review would be proper in district court only if the Board decided the merits of the discrimination claim. In other cases, including dismissals on procedural grounds, we held that this court would be the proper forum to review the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several circuits adopted the position taken by this court, holding that judicial review of mixed case appeals dismissed in the first instance by the Board on any nonmerits grounds fell under our jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See McCarthy v. Vilsack</span>, 322 F. App'x 456, 458 (7th Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 158 F.3d 597, 598-99 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Sloan v. West</span>, 140 F.3d 1255, 1261-62 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Blake v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 794 F.2d 170, 172-73 (5th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">cf. Burzynski v. Cohen</span>, 264 F.3d 611, 620-21 (6th Cir. 2001) (holding judicial review of a jurisdictional dismissal by the Board must be in the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two circuits departed from the approach employed in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> and held that judicial review in cases in which the Board rejected the employee's claim on procedural grounds belongs in district court and not in this court. <span class="Italic">See Harms v. Internal Rev. Serv</span>., 321 F.3d 1001, 1008 (10th Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Downey v. Runyon</span>, 160 F.3d 139, 144-45 (2d Cir. 1998). Importantly, the circuits that departed from our rule did so in cases in which the Board had jurisdiction over the employee's adverse action appeal but did not reach the merits of the employee's discrimination claim due to a procedural fault. Those courts did not hold that the Federal Circuit would be the wrong forum to review a ruling by the Board that it lacked jurisdiction over the employee's adverse action claim. In fact, in <span class="Italic">Harms</span> the Tenth Circuit specifically stated that "when the MSPB decides that it lacks jurisdiction over an appeal because the employment action is not within the MSPB's designated appellate jurisdiction, the appeal is not a 'case of discrimination' under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)," and accordingly the appeal should be reviewed by the Federal Circuit. 321 F.3d at 1008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 639 F.3d 834 (8th Cir. 2011), the Eighth Circuit had occasion to address the conflicting precedents on this issue. The court noted that the <span class="Italic">Harms</span> case taught that this court was the proper forum for judicial review when the Board dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but not when the Board dismissed for nonjurisdictional procedural reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 837. The Eighth Circuit adhered to the majority rule, however, holding that judicial review in both classes of cases should be in this court and that district courts would have jurisdiction over mixed case appeals only if the Board reached the merits of the employee's discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 838.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court granted review in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> and reversed. Endorsing the minority view, the Court held that judicial review of procedural dismissals by the Board must be obtained in district court. The Court, however, was silent on the question of how to treat jurisdictional dismissals, such as the one at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> did not explicitly address the jurisdictional issue presented here, the statutory text, the Court's rationale in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, our own prior decisions, and the decisions of other courts all indicate that an appeal from the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction belongs in this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory point is simple but compelling. Section 7703(b)(1) of Title 5 states that, except for one relevant exception provided in section 7703(b)(2), review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board will be in the Federal Circuit. Section 7703(b)(2) states that "cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702" shall be filed in the district court. Therefore, appeals of Board decisions must be brought in the Federal Circuit unless they are subject to section 7702. Section 7702, in turn, applies to cases in which an employee "(A) has been affected by an action which the employee... may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board" and "(B) alleges... discrimination." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). These are the mixed case appeals. Because an employee "may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board" only if the employee's claim is within the Board's appellate jurisdiction, the plain import of this statutory language is that a purported mixed case appeal is reviewed by a district court only if the Board has jurisdiction to decide the appeal from the adverse action in issue.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The dissent contends that the same analysis would apply to procedural dismissals, as "an employee also may only appeal to the Board if he does so within the applicable time limits," including the procedural 30-day limit set out in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a). But that is not true. The Board has the authority to entertain appeals that are procedurally defective under its own regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.12, but it may not hear a case over which it lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It therefore follows that sections 7703(b)(1) and 7702(a)(1)(A) give this court jurisdiction to review a Board determination that an employee's case is not appealable to the Board, regardless of whether the employee has sought to raise claims of agency discrimination. Thus, for example, if an employee sought Board review of a minor disciplinary action, such as suspension for fewer than 15 days, the appeal would plainly be outside the Board's jurisdiction, and review of the Board's decision would be in this court, not in the district court, even if the employee contended that the action was taken because of discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>. The statute, moreover, requires that the Board actually have jurisdiction over the employee's claim, not merely that the employee allege Board jurisdiction. As we held in our <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, "mere assertion does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in [a] voluntary resignation case." <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> supports our conclusion. The employee in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> filed her discrimination claim after the 30-day regulatory deadline provided for in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a). Thus, her claim was barred under a procedural rule; the Board dismissed her case only after finding that she had failed to show good cause for her delay. In holding that the district court could hear her claim, the Supreme Court reversed only the line of authority holding that "mixed cases" dismissed by the Board on procedural grounds were appealable to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> is clear in light of the issue the Court took the case to decide. The Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> "to resolve a Circuit split on whether an employee seeking judicial review should proceed in the Federal Circuit or in a district court when the MSPB has dismissed her mixed case on procedural grounds." <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 133 S. Ct. at 603. As we have noted, the courts of appeals that have addressed the issue have unanimously agreed that this court is the appropriate forum for jurisdictional dismissals, and therefore there was no circuit split for the Supreme Court to resolve on that point. The Court reiterated several times throughout its opinion that it was deciding the question whether judicial review of procedural dismissals of mixed case appeals should go to the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 600, 602-07.[2] By contrast, the Court never mentioned jurisdiction al dismissals, nor did it suggest that the rule it adopted applied to any cases falling outside the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In light of the Supreme Court's consistent reference to "procedural" dismissals, we do not agree with the dissent that <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> was simply silent on the distinction between procedural and jurisdictional limitations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, the Court reached its decision pursuant to a statutory analysis similar to the one we have undertaken here. It held, as we do today, that "mixed cases" are those subject to section 7702. 133 S. Ct. at 603-05. Significantly, the Court characterized mixed cases, which it held are judicially reviewable in district court, as "those appealable to the MSPB and alleging discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 604. And the Court pointed out that Ms. Kloeckner had been removed and thus undoubtedly "she was affected by an action (i.e., removal) appealable to the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court did not suggest that the same rule would apply to cases falling outside the Board's jurisdiction, such as resignations or retirements that were not shown to be involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> does not bear on the precise question before us, the rule we apply today must be consistent with the binding law of this circuit. In <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, we analyzed section 7702(a)(1) and concluded that it dictated that jurisdictional dismissals by the Board were reviewable in this court. 738 F.2d at 1246-47. Although we applied that principle to procedural dismissals as well, that aspect of the decision was not necessary to resolve the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, while the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> rejected <span class="Italic">Ballentine's</span> extension of its holding to procedural dismissals, it did not affect the portion of <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> that dealt with jurisdictional dismissals. For that reason, this court's statutory analysis of jurisdictional dismissals in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> and subsequent cases is still good law,[3] and we are required to follow it. <span class="Italic">See Oja</span>, 405 F.3d at 1355; <span class="Italic">Austin</span>, 136 F.3d at 784; <span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1089.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The dissent argues that <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> overruled <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> in its entirety because "<span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, like <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, involved the application of rules governing the time for filing." That argument ignores the fact that, unlike the regulatory 30-day period at issue in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the timing issue in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> was jurisdictional. Ballentine had brought his challenge before either the agency decision had issued or 120 days had passed since his initial complaint. <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1248; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. Consequently, the Board lacked jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, our decision in this case is consistent with the unanimous view of the circuits that have addressed this question. As we have observed, the two circuits that had rejected this court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> addressed Board dismissals on procedural grounds, not for lack of jurisdiction. And the Tenth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Harms</span> specifically reasoned, in the course of holding <span id="Page_5259"></span>procedural dismissals to be reviewable in district court, that it would have adopted a different view if the Board had dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional, rather than procedural, grounds. 321 F.3d at 1008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the dissent, our decision does not deprive a litigant such as Ms. Conforto of the right to a ruling on her discrimination claims. As the Supreme Court made clear in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 133 S. Ct. at 601, a federal employee in Ms. Conforto's position can elect to bypass the Merit Systems Protection Board altogether and file a complaint against her agency in district court. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1342. Our jurisdictional decisions affect only those cases in which an employee elects to proceed by appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board but the Board concludes it does not have jurisdiction over the employee's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In such a case, if we hold that the Board was correct in its jurisdictional ruling, relief from the Board is of course closed to the employee. But the employee is free to pursue any other remedy that the employee has preserved, such as a Title VII action in district court. <span class="Italic">See Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1247-48; <span class="Italic">Sloan</span>, 140 F.3d at 1260-61.[4] If, on the other hand, we hold that the Board does have jurisdiction, the case returns to the Board for resolution of the merits of the discrimination claim, with review of that ruling available in the district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Courts have uniformly stated that the decision of the Board, or of this court, holding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the employee's appeal, would not be given collateral estoppel effect in a discrimination action brought in district court. <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 158 F.3d at 599 n.2; <span class="Italic">Sloan</span>, 140 F.3d at 1262 n.20; <span class="Italic">Dews-Miller v. Clinton</span>, 707 F. Supp.2d 28, 53 n.19 (D.D.C. 2010); <span class="Italic">Burrell v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 164 F. Supp.2d 805, 811 (E.D. La. 2001); <span class="Italic">Long v. Frank</span>, 808 F. Supp. 961, 966 (E.D.N.Y. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent asserts that in the context of claims of involuntary separation, deciding the issue of Board jurisdiction necessarily requires this court to decide the merits of the employee's discrimination claim, because the issues of discrimination and Board jurisdiction are "identical." That is not so, as this court explained in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1341. In order to establish the Board's jurisdiction, the employee must show that he was forced to resign or retire. The employee in such cases may claim that he was forced to resign or retire in part or in whole because of discrimination by the agency, but the two questions--involuntariness and discrimination--present distinct issues: whether improper conduct by the agency compelled the employee to resign, and whether the allegedly improper conduct was the product of discrimination. Coercion can be found without proof that the improper conduct was the product of discrimination, and discrimination can be found without proof that the discriminatory conduct was so serious as to compel the employee to resign. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The presence of discrimination is neither necessary nor sufficient to give the Board jurisdiction over a constructive removal claim.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Contrary to the dissent, <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> did not hold that any employee "must prove that the discrimination existed in order to prove coercion (and therefore Board jurisdiction)." <span class="Italic">See Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1244 ("Cruz has submitted no evidence... indicating that his resignation was involuntary."). We also rejected the dissent's contention in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>. 437 F.3d at 1341 (noting "differences between the jurisdictional issues and the merits of the discrimination claim," including that "in mixed cases the discrimination claim itself is adjudicated using the elements, burdens, and defenses specific to the underlying discrimination statute."). The dissent is therefore mistaken to suggest that differences between the jurisdictional issue and the discrimination claim go only to "the scope of relief" available to the employee, and not the merits of the claim itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the issue of coercion--the precise issue presented to us in appeals of this kind--our role is simply to determine whether the employee has made a sufficient showing of coercion to give the Board authority to decide a case that would otherwise be outside the statutory limits of its jurisdiction. We established that principle in our <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, and although the dissenting judge in this case disagrees with that decision, we are not free to disregard it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that the plain language of section 7702(a)(1) dictates that when the Board dismisses a purported mixed case appeal for lack of jurisdiction, any appeal from that decision is to this court. We decline Ms. Conforto's invitation to read the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> so broadly as to remove this court's jurisdiction over appeals in such cases. In this case, the Board found that Ms. Conforto's retirement was voluntary and therefore held, in accordance with the binding precedent of this court, that it lacked jurisdiction over her claim of constructive removal. For that reason, the exception to our jurisdiction described in sections 7702(a) and 7703(b)(2) does not apply. We have jurisdiction to decide Ms. Conforto's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits of the jurisdictional issue, the Board was correct in ruling that Ms. Conforto failed to make a non-frivolous showing that her retirement was "'involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal.'" <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1328, quoting <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 260 F.3d 1336, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We therefore uphold the Board's ruling dismissing her appeal without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The two principal grounds on which employees have sought to show that their resignations or retirements were involuntary are (1) that the resignation or retirement was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency, <span class="Italic">see Covington v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and (2) that the resignation or retirement was the product of coercion by the agency, <span class="Italic">see Dumas v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Ms. Conforto relies on the latter ground, invoking the principle that a retirement can be involuntary if the employee's agency coerced her into retiring "'by creating working conditions so intolerable'" that she was "'driven to involuntarily... retire.'" <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1328, <span class="Italic">quoting Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test for involuntariness is objective. The employee must overcome the presumption that her resignation or retirement was voluntary and must do so by establishing "'that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstances would feel coerced into resigning'" or retiring. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329, <span class="Italic">quoting Middleton v. Dep't of Def</span>., 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">see also Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024-25 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Ms. Conforto was entitled to a hearing only if she made a non-frivolous showing of coerced retirement. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of coercive involuntariness "'is a narrow one,' requiring that the employee 'satisfy a demanding legal standard.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1329, <span class="Italic">quoting Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996). An employee's dissatisfaction with the options that an agency has made available to him is not sufficient to render his decision to resign or retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Mueller v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 76 F.3d 1198, 1202-03 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 591 F.2d 688, 692 (Ct. Cl. 1979) ("[T]he fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or has to choose between two unpleasant alternatives does not make the resulting action involuntary unless there is deception, coercion, duress, time pressure or intimidation."). Thus, the doctrine of coerced involuntariness does not apply if the employee resigns or retires because he does not like agency decisions such as "a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant... that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. Moreover, the coercion must be "the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency conducted a detailed analysis of Ms. Conforto's allegations and concluded that there was a reasonable, nondiscriminatory explanation for each of the incidents of which she complained. For example, with respect to her allegation that the agency took away her designated parking spot, the agency explained that all the parking spaces for employees in her department were taken away when it was discovered that those parking places were being used without authorization and that those individuals should have been using staff parking spots. With respect to her complaint about being denied a promotion, the agency explained that no promotion was at issue; rather, another individual was designated to act as the Acting Department Head in the absence of the Department Head (a military position), and that the decision was based on an internal recommendation as to who was best suited to take over that responsibility. Moreover, Ms. Conforto was eventually assigned the role of Acting Department Head after that individual vacated the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In investigating Ms. Conforto's contentions regarding the disapproval of training opportunities, the agency found that the April 2010 training was not required for Ms. Conforto's position and that, because of budgetary considerations, Ms. Conforto's division was able to send only four people to the April 2010 training session. The supervisor who made the selection, according to the agency's findings, did so based on the selectees' field of expertise. As for the day-and-a-half training session that Ms. Conforto wished to attend in early August, entitled "Take Back Your Life," the agency concluded that Ms. Conforto had not been prevented from attending the session. However, according to the agency's findings, an important audit for Ms. Conforto's division was to occur only a few days after the training session, and the responsible agency officials advised her that although she was free to attend the training session, the department's performance in the audit was her responsibility. Ms. Conforto ultimately decided not to attend the training session.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency conducted a similar analysis of each of the allegations of discrimination that, according to Ms. Conforto, occurred during the months after she advised the agency, in September 2010, that she was going to retire as of the end of that year. The agency concluded that the October 2010 letter of reprimand sent to Ms. Conforto was based on her failure to complete her assigned tasks and her unprofessional conduct in dealings with one of her supervisors. The agency further stated that the agency official who proposed a seven-day suspension for Ms. Conforto (which was never effected) did so based on her failure to complete <span id="Page_5260"></span>assignments, a leave violation, and inappropriate conduct on her part. As to the denial of sick leave, the agency concluded that Ms. Conforto's supervisor had denied her request for leave because he believed it was for annual leave for a day in which her presence was required, but that when Ms. Conforto clarified that the request was for medical reasons, he approved the request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, Ms. Conforto's response to his order to show why the Board had jurisdiction over her case did not contain a factual response to the agency's analysis. Instead, she simply re-asserted her claims that the various incidents that occurred between late 2009 and early 2011 were all motivated by unlawful discrimination and retaliation both for her prior EEO activities and for her appeal of her 2009 performance rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the state of the record, the administrative judge was clearly correct to hold that Ms. Conforto failed to satisfy her burden of making non-frivolous allegations that she had been subjected to coercive pressures sufficient to compel a reasonable person to retire involuntarily. In short, she did not demonstrate that she had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and that her retirement was the result of "improper acts" by the agency. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). For that reason, we sustain the Board's decision that Ms. Conforto failed to show that her retirement was involuntary--and thus tantamount to a removal action. Accordingly, the Board correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Circuit law before <span class="Italic">Perry</span> and <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> was mixed--mixed and confused--sufficiently so to attract eventual Supreme Court attention. In <span class="Italic">Wall v. United States</span>, 871 F.2d 1540, 1543 (10th Cir. 1989), the reviewing court may have added confusion to the judicial review equation. The appellant appealed to the Board and lost his claim that his retirement was the product of deceit by the employer and that it was involuntary and discriminatory on the bases of age and disability. Apparently the AJ ruled that the retirement was voluntary, and the EEO claims were not reached. The appellant then pursued his case in district court, asserting that the retirement was the result of disability discrimination. The district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The circuit court affirmed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he district court... construed those statutory [jurisdictional] provisions to mean that where the Board determines, as it did in the instant case, that an employee's appeal to the Board is "not appealable" under the statute, and the Board does not consider the employee's claim of discrimination on its merits, review of the Board's determination that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the employee's claim lies exclusively in the Federal Circuit. As the district court noted, if, in the instant case, the Federal Circuit reverses the Board's determination that Wall's retirement was voluntary, the matter will then be remanded to the Board to hear Wall's discrimination claim on its merits. Should Wall then suffer an adverse ruling on the discrimination issue, he could then file an action in the district court. It would seem to follow that should the Federal Circuit on appeal uphold the Board's finding that Wall voluntarily retired, such would rule out any claim of discrimination. If Wall, in fact and in law, voluntarily retired, he cannot argue that his termination was the result of agency discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, a dissenter had another view, 871 F.2d at 1547:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he majority appears to equate the issue of voluntariness, which underlies the jurisdictional question, with the claim of discrimination.... &#8197;If the two issues are in fact one and the same, that issue is whether the alleged discrimination resulted in a constructive discharge, i.e., an involuntary termination. Requiring Wall to appeal the Board's resolution of this issue in the Federal Circuit deprives him of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of his discrimination claim in district court....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... Apart from the conceptual difficulty of separating the issues of voluntariness and discriminatory constructive discharge, under the <span id="Page_5261"></span>Government's analysis, as it candidly admits, a person in Wall's position may be unable to raise his discrimination claim in any judicial forum. I cannot accept the Government's conclusion that Congress intended federal employees to be without a remedy in this situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wall v. DHHS</span>, 637 F. Supp. 90 (D. Kan. 1986) (applying <span class="Italic">Ballentine, supra:</span> when an appeal is taken to the Board on an involuntary retirement, the Board first decides the jurisdictional issue, and that issue is reviewed in the Federal Circuit; only if there is jurisdiction does the Board then decide the EEO issue).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sloan v. West</span>, 140 F.3d 1255, 1260-63 (9th Cir. 1998), concluded that if the Board rejects a mixed case appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the proper route is for the employee to appeal the jurisdictional issue to the Federal Circuit. During the pendency of that appeal, the EEO claims are tolled. If the Federal Circuit finds there is no Board jurisdiction, the employee may then proceed along the EEO route. If the Board has jurisdiction, the case returns to the Board as a mixed case. <span class="Italic">Sloan</span> explained (over the dissent of Judge Reinhardt, who would have given the employee the option of proceeding (or returning) to district court, abandoning his civil service claims and pursuing only his EEO claims):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB does not possess jurisdiction over claims that do not fall into one of the five "adverse action" categories outlined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. In addition, the MSPB may not exercise jurisdiction over a claim of discrimination that is completely divorced from a personnel action otherwise within its jurisdiction pursuant to &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">McAdams</span>, 64 F.3d at 1143. Ordinarily, if the MSPB finds it lacks jurisdiction over either the entire case, or over one of the claims, it will dismiss the complaint and/or claims; advise the employee to seek appropriate review of any extra-jurisdictional non-discrimination claims through other channels within the agency; and advise the employee to pursue any discrimination claims by filing a complaint with the agency EEO and otherwise exhausting administrative remedies pursuant to Title VII. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) (1997). When a discrimination complaint is dismissed by the MSPB for lack of jurisdiction, the statute of limitations for filing the complaint with the agency EEO is considered to have been tolled by filing the complaint with the MSPB.[17]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) (1997). The statute of limitations is also tolled while the MSPB is considering the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as a general rule, an MSPB determination that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim is appealable only to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. By contrast, a "mixed case appeal," in which the MSPB decides the merits of both the nondiscrimination claim and the discrimination claim, is appealed to the appropriate district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the plain language of the statute, we join our sister circuits and hold that appeals of MSPB jurisdictional decisions involving mixed claims are properly venued in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.[20]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;One concern about this result raised in <span class="Italic">Washington v. Garrett,</span> 10 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1993), is the potential collateral effect of a jurisdictional decision by the Federal Circuit on a subsequent Title VII case. Ordinarily, collateral estoppel would not apply because the discrimination issues would not be "actually litigated and necessarily determined" in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Davis &#x0026; Cox v.</span> <span class="Italic">Summa Corp.,</span> 751 F.2d 1507, 1518 (9th Cir. 1985). Further, because of the limited nature of the MSPB inquiry and Federal Circuit jurisdictional appeal, there would be "reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness of procedures followed in prior litigation" which would normally "warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion." <span class="Italic">Montana v. United States,</span> 440 U.S. 147, 155 &#x0026; 163 n.11, 99 S. Ct. 970, 974-75 &#x0026; 979 n.11, 59 L. Ed.2d 210 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that an appeal of an MSPB mixed case jurisdictional decision does not toll the statute of limitations from running on the claimant's Title VII claim. However, adoption of this theory would effectively preclude discrimination claims in mixed cases where the MSPB dismisses for lack of jurisdiction. Ordinarily, a Title VII claimant must exhaust his or her administrative remedies by: filing an EEO complaint within 45 days of the effective date of the personnel action; and either (1) appealing the EEO decision to the EEOC within 20 days of receipt of a final agency decision; or (2) filing a suit in district court within 30 days of the receipt of the EEO's final decision. 32 CFR &#x00A7; 588 app. A (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a Title VII claimant elects to pursue his or her MSPB remedies through a mixed case complaint and the MSPB dismisses a mixed case claim for lack of jurisdiction, the Title VII statute of limitations is tolled in order to allow the claimant to exhaust his or her EEO and/or EEOC administrative remedies and file in federal court. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the government's theory, the statute would begin running again if the claimant elected to appeal the MSPB jurisdictional decision. Thus, a claimant's Title VII statute of limitations would run before the appellate briefing was complete. The Civil Service Reform Act was not intended to present a claimant with a Hobson's litigation choice upon exhaustion of his or her MSPB administrative remedies. Indeed, such an outcome would be antithetical to the statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Title VII statute of limitations is not a jurisdictional requirement; it may be waived, and equitably tolled. <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385, 394, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 1133, 71 L. Ed.2d 234 (1983). Statutory time limits applicable to public employers are subject to equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457-58, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990). Equitable tolling is routinely held to be proper where, as here, a claimant filed suit in a venue without jurisdiction over the claim.[22]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[22]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See e.g., Burnett v. New York Central Railroad Co.</span>, 380 U.S. 424, 85 S. Ct. 1050, 13 L. Ed.2d 941 (1965) (employee's Ohio court FELA action tolled federal limitations provision, although Ohio action was dismissed for improper venue); <span class="Italic">Herb v.</span> <span class="Italic">Pitcairn,</span> 325 U.S. 77, 65 S. Ct. 954, 89 L.

Kraft,</span> 801 F.2d 1170 (9th Cir. 1986) (filing of complaint in California state court alleging sex discrimination equitably tolled running of 90-day filing requirement for civil rights action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, consistent with the regulations, we hold that, when a "mixed case claim" is filed with the MSPB, the statute of limitations for filing with the EEO and/or the EEOC are equitably tolled. Moreover, the tolling period lasts until the appellant has received a final jurisdictional determination from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We transfer this case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. <span class="Italic">See Billops v. Department of Air Force,</span> 725 F.2d 1160 (8th Cir. 1984) (MSPB case can be properly transferred to the Federal Circuit where, though district court lacked jurisdiction, appeal was timely filed in district court). The statute of limitations on appellant's Title VII claim is hereby tolled pending final resolution of the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sloan</span> reached a result that consigned an employee to years, if not a decade, of expensive litigation. The employee who filed a mixed case appeal with the Board and lost on the merits proceeded to district court for "appellate" review of civil service and <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of EEO claims. Under <span class="Italic">Sloan</span>, the employee who filed a mixed case appeal with the Board and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction was to first test the jurisdictional issue in the Federal Circuit, then return to the Board if the Board has jurisdiction, and then proceed to district court if he lost on the merits before the Board. Although the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to determine the Board's jurisdiction, nothing makes that circuit's review authority exclusive. 5 USC 7703(b)(2) places jurisdiction in district courts over cases involving discrimination. Those courts are then supposed to apply Federal Circuit law to civil service issues. Nothing exempts issues involving Board jurisdiction from the district court review process and nothing precludes a district court from remanding a case within the Board's jurisdiction to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Powell v. DOD</span>, 158 F.3d 597, 598-600 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the D.C. Circuit joined forces with the Ninth and Tenth Circuits in <span class="Italic">Sloan</span> and <span class="Italic">Wall</span>. The employee, following some "unexplained absences," agreed to a reassignment to a temporary position. When the position expired, Powell appealed, claiming a constructive discharge from the tenured position she held prior to the reassignment. Powell alleged discrimination in the appeal. The Board dismissed the appeal because she had not raised issues of fact sufficient to support her claim of MSPB jurisdiction from what the Board characterized as a voluntary termination. Powell took her case to federal district court on a discrimination theory, but, relying upon <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, the court determined that hers was not truly a mixed case because it involved only a discrimination claim and "not a Board jurisdictional claim." Following the decisions in <span class="Italic">Sloan</span> and <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, the D.C. Circuit determined that review should have been directed to the Federal Circuit on the jurisdictional issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the district court or, instead, the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction to review the Board's adverse action, turns on the nature of the Board's decision in this case. In general, 5 USC 7702 and 7703 govern judicial review of Board decisions. Section 7703(b)(1) gives the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over "petition[s] to review a final order or final decision of the Board.... " 5 USC 7703(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 28 USC 1295(a)(9). There is, however, an exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction. Section 7703(b)(2) gives jurisdiction to the district courts for "cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title.... " 5 USC 7703(b)(2). Section 7702 lists the categories of cases within the jurisdiction of the district courts. In order to come within one of these categories, the complainant must satisfy two requirements. First, he must have been "affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 USC 7702(a)(1)(A). The types of adverse actions over which the Board has jurisdiction are listed in 5 USC 7512. Second, the employee must allege "that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by--(i) section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16).... " 5 USC 7702(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702 and 7703(b)(2) grant district courts jurisdiction to review Board decisions in mixed-case appeals, the Federal Circuit holds that those provisions do not defeat its jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) to review certain decisions in which the Board has dismissed on procedural <span id="Page_5262"></span>or threshold grounds<span class="Italic">. See Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1247. In <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, the Board had decided that it lacked jurisdiction over a mixed-case appeal because the complainant, who had been demoted by the U.S. Marshals Service, filed his appeal prematurely<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1245. When the complainant appealed the Board's dismissal to the Federal Circuit, the Board moved to transfer the appeal to district court, which, according to the Board, had jurisdiction over mixed-case appeals pursuant to 5 USC 7703(b)(2)<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Federal Circuit denied the transfer, holding that "[w]hen an appeal has been taken to the [Board], until the discrimination issue and the appealable action have been decided on the merits by the [Board], an appellant is granted no rights to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in a civil action.... " <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1246. The Board in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> had not reached the merits; its dismissal on grounds of timeliness was purely procedural<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1248. "[U]ntil the merits of a 'mixed' discrimination case are reached by the [Board] ," the court continued, "procedural or threshold matters, not related to the merits of a discrimination claim before the [Board], may properly be appealed to [the Federal Circuit]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1247.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Powell uses the statement just quoted to argue that <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> does not control jurisdiction over her appeal<span class="Italic">. Ballentine</span>, she points out, only applies to mixed-case appeals in which the Board has <span class="Italic">not</span> reached the merits. Powell asserts that here, by contrast, the Board's decision <span class="Italic">was</span> "related to the merits" of her discrimination claim because proof of constructive termination would necessarily be an element of her claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Powell is correct that the factual setting of <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> is not precisely the same as her case. She is not correct in arguing that <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> has no bearing on the jurisdictional issue. It may be true that evidence of voluntariness or constructive termination is more closely "related to the merits of a discrimination claim" than the timeliness question presented in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>. But even if the Board's decision regarding voluntariness is "related to the merits" of Powell's discrimination claim, that decision nevertheless also rested on a "procedural or threshold matter"--the Board's view of its jurisdiction. The Board was quite emphatic on the point: "Appellant has failed to show that the reassignment was involuntary.... &#8197;[A]ppellant has failed to establish Board jurisdiction.... &#8197;[A]ppellant's allegations of discrimination, alone, cannot invoke the Board's jurisdiction.... &#8197;[A]ppellant has not raised issues of fact sufficient to support her claim of jurisdiction.... " Powell has offered no good reason why Board decisions based on procedural or threshold matters that <span class="Italic">are</span> related to the merits should not, under <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, be reviewable in the Federal Circuit, and two federal courts of appeal have decided that they should be<span class="Italic">. See Sloan v. West</span>, 140 F.3d 1255, 1261-62 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Wall v. United States</span>, 871 F.2d 1540, 1543-44 (10th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sloan</span>, a civilian employee of the Army Corps of Engineers had been retroactively promoted to a higher GS level--an action triggering an automatic termination provision ending his employment<span class="Italic">. Sloan</span>, 140 F.3d at 1257. On the employee's administrative appeal of his termination, the Board dismissed, finding that the termination had not been involuntary and that the Board therefore had no jurisdiction over the appeal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1258. When the employee sought review in district court, the district court also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, holding that because the Board's dismissal had been on jurisdictional grounds, only the Federal Circuit could review the adverse decision<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that even when "the jurisdictional question is intertwined with the discrimination claim," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1261, review of an adverse Board decision is proper only in the Federal Circuit<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1262.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Tenth Circuit's <span class="Italic">Wall</span> opinion made it clear that a voluntariness determination by the Board fell within the scope of <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> and was thus appealable only to the Federal Circuit<span class="Italic">. Wall</span>, 871 F.2d at 1543. In <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, an employee of the Department of Health and Human Services had executed an application for retirement shortly before having his employment terminated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1541. The employee appealed the termination to the Board, arguing that he had been misled into applying for retirement and claiming wrongful termination based on a physical handicap<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Board found that the employee's retirement had been voluntary, and therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1542. The employee sought review in the district court, and the Tenth Circuit ultimately affirmed the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that only the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction to review a Board decision made on jurisdictional grounds<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Powell objects that the courts in <span class="Italic">Sloan</span> and <span class="Italic">Wall</span> failed to provide reasons for extending <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> to situations like hers, in which the Board's decision on threshold or procedural grounds is related to the merits of a discrimination claim. This system, she tells us, is potentially duplicative: if the Federal Circuit reverses such a Board decision, and the Board reaches the merits on remand, judicial review would then be in district court. While <span class="Italic">Sloan</span> and <span class="Italic">Wall</span> offered little in the way of analysis, we think the decisions were nevertheless correct. The main point of <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> is that the boundaries of the Board's jurisdiction should be subject to uniform interpretation in a single forum--the Federal Circuit<span class="Italic">. See Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1247. To hold that <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> does not apply in a case such as Powell's would be to undermine <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>. District courts--and, in appeals, the circuit courts--would wind up determining questions of Board jurisdiction, with potentially inconsistent results. By adopting the approach of <span class="Italic">Sloan</span> and <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, we create no more potential for duplicative judicial review--or more accurately, <span class="Italic">successive</span> judicial review--than that created by <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are aware that mixed-case complainants like Powell, to be absolutely safe, might see fit to file simultaneously in the Federal Circuit and in the district court. Otherwise, if the complainant chooses the wrong judicial forum for reviewing the Board's decision, he may be unable to obtain any review because the time for appealing in the correct forum has passed. Indeed, even if the complainant chooses the right forum or appeals the Board's jurisdictional dismissal to both courts, he may be unable to obtain any review because the time for pursuing an Equal Employment Opportunity remedy will have run. As the government acknowledged at oral argument, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations provide for tolling if the Board dismisses the appeal for jurisdictional reasons but apparently leave a gap in the tolling when the complainant elects to pursue an appeal of the Board decision in the Federal Circuit<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1614.302(b). Because this gap in protection is inconsistent with the statutory purpose of preserving the rights of federal employees who seek review of mixed-case appeals in federal district court, we suggest that the agency consider amending its regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3220), the Federal Circuit explained that it would have the authority to review a Board appeal finding against an appellant whose theory was that discrimination forced him to retire. The appellate issue was one of procedure rather than substantive EEO law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until December 30, 1997, petitioner was a Transportation Policy Analyst in the Department of Transportation. On May 15, 1997, petitioner signed an agreement to retire under the Department of Transportation's Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay ("VSIP") program, under which he would receive a $25,000 incentive payment. In that agreement, petitioner acknowledged that "[m]y decision to retire is entirely voluntary and has not been coerced." On December 30, 1997, petitioner's retirement became effective and he soon thereafter received his $25,000 incentive payment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 9, 1997, petitioner filed a formal complaint to the Department of Transportation's Office of Civil Rights alleging that he was being forced to retire because of employment discrimination. After some revisions to his allegations, petitioner ultimately alleged that his Department of Transportation supervisor discriminated against him based upon his religion (Protestant) and reprisal for filing previous complaints with the EEOC, making working conditions so hostile and intolerable that petitioner had no choice but to retire. On August 2, 2000, the Department of Transportation issued its final agency decision, finding that petitioner did not meet his burden of proving that he was subjected to discrimination. Petitioner timely appealed this decision to the Board.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 3, 2001, the administrative judge issued an Initial Decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because petitioner did not establish that his working conditions were rendered so difficult or intolerable that a reasonable person in petitioner's position would have felt compelled to retire. The administrative judge also denied petitioner's request for a hearing because petitioner failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have jurisdiction to review the Board's decision because the Board did not reach the merits of petitioner's discrimination claim when it dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. As a general rule, this court has jurisdiction over final Board decisions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). But appeals of Board decisions involving allegations of discrimination where the Board reached the merits of the discrimination claim must be reviewed by the district courts. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1491 (Fed. Cir. 1983). A mere allegation of discrimination does not automatically divest us of jurisdiction; whether jurisdiction lies in this court or in the district courts turns on the nature of the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 158 F.3d 597, 598 (D.C. Cir. 1998). When the Board rules on "procedural or threshold matters" we retain jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Because the Board's determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction is a "procedural or threshold matter," this court, rather than a district court, reviews the Board's jurisdictional decision. <span class="Italic">Syan v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Sloan v. West</span>, 140 F.3d 1255, 1261 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdictional determination here was "procedural" because it did not decide the merits of the discrimination claim, even though it was intertwined with the merits of the discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 158 F.3d at 599 (holding that the Board's decision regarding voluntariness rested on a "procedural or threshold matter" even if the decision was <span id="Page_5263"></span>also "related to the merits" of the discrimination claim); <span class="Italic">Wall v. United States</span>, 871 F.2d 1540, 1543 (10th Cir. 1989) (holding that where the Board determines that an employee's appeal to the Board is "not appealable" under the statute, review of the Board's jurisdictional determination lies with the Federal Circuit). Thus, because the Board's jurisdictional decision rested on a "procedural or threshold matter," we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cothron-Mallett v. MSPB</span>, 590 Fed. Appx. 967 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), involving review of involuntary resignation appeal, went through considerable analysis of disability accommodation law to determine if the appellant's resignation was the product of alleged failure of the employing agency to accommodate a disability by permitting the appellant to work out of her home.</p>
