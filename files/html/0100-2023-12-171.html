<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-170"><span class="space">a.</span> Electronic Filing Problem</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A filing delayed by one day because of apparent problems with the Board's electronic filing system was excused, <span class="Italic">Boykin v. USPS</span>, 104 MSPR 460, 461-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7, 2007 MSPB 5 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On May 2, 2006, the appellant filed an appeal of his demotion electronically (e-appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an acknowledgement order, the administrative judge (AJ) advised the appellant that his appeal appeared to be untimely and ordered him to show that the appeal was timely or that good cause existed for any delay. In response, the appellant's representative maintained that "on or about" May 1, 2006, he attempted to file an e-appeal, but was unable to do so. The appellant's representative asserted that the e-filing screen indicated that the session had timed out and that he should restart the process, but that a message on the screen indicated that the server was experiencing an error because of a faulty connection.<span class="Italic"></span> He asserted that he made another attempt to file an e-appeal the following day, on May 2, 2006, and was successful.<span class="Italic"></span> The agency filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the basis that it was untimely and the appellant failed to show good cause for his filing delay. The agency also filed a response to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ then dismissed the appeal as untimely filed. He noted that the deadline for the appellant to file his appeal was May 1, 2006, but the appeal was not filed until May 2, 2006, and was therefore one day late. He found that: The appellant submitted no evidence to support his representative's assertion that he was unable to file an e-appeal on May 1, 2006; the appellant's representative did not explain why the appeal could not have been filed before the May 1st deadline; and the appellant remained personally responsible for the prosecution of his appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). The Board should consider the length of the delay in every good cause determination<span class="Italic">. Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's representative alleged before the AJ that: On May 1, 2006, he accessed the Board's e-filing site; he repeatedly received "timed out" messages and was unable to continue with the process; he made multiple attempts to log on again but was unsuccessful; and he was able to complete the filing process the following day. The Board's records support the representative's account. According to the Board's e-appeal "Event Log," on May 1, 2006, the user name associated with the appellant's representative created e-Appeal No. 200601232. This appeal was completed and filed the next day. Furthermore, several users reported having problems using e-appeal around May 1-3, 2006. Although the Board's online e-appeal site was available and pleadings did get filed during that time, the incidence of problems was higher than usual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appeal here was untimely by only one day. Based on the length of the delay, and considering the particular circumstances of this case, we credit the appellant's representative's account, find that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence, and excuse the appellant's late filing. The agency has not shown, or even alleged, that it was prejudiced by the very short filing delay. <span class="Italic">See LaGuardia v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 8 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A one-day delay in filing the PFR was excused as a result of a shutdown of the e-filing system, <span class="Italic">Miller v. FDIC</span>, DC-3330-13-0684-I-1 (NP 5/14/2014)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, although the record reflects that the appellant filed his petition for review 1-day late, we find that he has established good cause for his untimely filing based upon the Board's e-Appeal system being unavailable due to scheduled maintenance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(g). The Board has previously found that the unavailability of its e-Appeal system can establish good cause for an untimely filing, especially when the party files its pleading within a short time after the e-Appeal system becomes available and the other party is unable to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the delay. <span class="Italic">See Boykin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2007).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In asserting that good cause exists for her untimely filing, the appellant's attorney argues that she sent the request for review to opposing counsel on March 18, 2014, but was unable to file until the following day, March 19, 2014, due to technical difficulties with the e-Appeal system. The Board's records confirm that the appellant's attorney attempted to use the system on March 18, 2014. The records also confirm that she contacted the Board the same day, reporting an inability to file an appeal that was due. Finally, the Board's records confirm that although the e-Appeal site was available, there was a higher than normal incidence of users reporting problems around that same time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these limited circumstances, and considering the length of the delay, we find that good cause exists for the appellant's untimely request for review. <span class="Italic">See Boykin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 31, 2014--the Monday after the petition was due--counsel for Barnes filed an untimely petition and a pleading captioned "Non-Consent Motion for Leave to File Appellant's Petition One Business Day Late, Petition Having Been Lodged." In that motion, counsel explained that he completed the petition on March 28, 2014, and assumed that the petition, which was 28 pages long, complied with the Board's filing requirements--30 pages or 7,500 words, whichever is less. Counsel indicated, however, that, when he performed a computer-generated word count in final preparation for filing, he discovered that the petition substantially exceeded the Board's 7,500-word limitation. Counsel explained that he immediately began editing the petition, but was unable to reduce it to 7,500 words before midnight on March 28, 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel attempted to electronically file the revised petition on Saturday, March 29, 2014, and again on Monday, March 31, 2014, but was unable to do so because the Board's e-Appeal system would not allow him to log in. Indeed, the Board concedes that the system was experiencing technical difficulties on Saturday, March 29th and Monday, March 31st. Counsel for Barnes ultimately filed the Petition and Non-Consent Motion for Leave to File by hand-delivering it to the Board's headquarters on the morning of March 31, 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 2, 2014, the Office of the Clerk of the Board issued a letter acknowledging March 31, 2014 as the filing date of the appellant's petition for review. The letter did not address the untimeliness of the petition. The Board filed its response to the petition for review on April 25, 2014, and Barnes ultimately filed a reply on May 28, 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 3, 2014, the Board issued a final order dismissing Barnes' petition for review as untimely filed. The Board recognized that a "delay of 3 days is relatively brief," but found that Barnes "has not shown good cause for his failure to meet the filing deadline." First, the Board noted that Barnes is represented by counsel who has practiced before the Board and, thus, is on notice of the Board's practices and procedures. Although counsel for Barnes conceded that "the delay was entirely his fault," the Board explained that "an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative." The Board further questioned how counsel could claim that he did not realize the length issue until the last minute. And, the Board noted that counsel could have filed a motion for extension of time on March 28, 2014. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *8-9 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(f) ("Motions for extensions must be filed with the Clerk of the Board on or before the date on which the petition or other pleading is due.")).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering all of the circumstances, the Board dismissed the petition as untimely filed. The AJ's initial decision thus became the final decision of the Board with respect to Barnes' removal. Barnes timely petitioned this court for review, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. We must affirm the Board's decision unless it was "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see Rocha v. Merit Syst. Prot. Bd</span>., 688 F.3d 1307, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A petition for review of a Board decision must be filed within 35 days of the decision's issuance or within 30 days of the petitioner's receipt of the decision, if the petitioner shows that he received the decision more than 5 days after it issued. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(e). The Board will, however, waive this time limit upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(g). "To establish good cause for a filing delay, an appellant must show that the delay was excusable under the circumstances and that the appellant exercised due diligence in attempting to meet the filing deadline." <span class="Italic">Zamot v. Merit Syst. Prot. Bd</span>., 332 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision to waive the regulatory time limit is committed to the discretion of the Board, and is reversed only for abuse of that discretion. <span class="Italic">See Mendoza v. Merit Syst. Prot. Bd</span>., 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("[W]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board."). The petitioner bears a "heavy burden of establishing that the Board abused its discretion in finding that he failed to show good cause for the delay in filing his petition for review." <span class="Italic">Zamot</span>, 332 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue on appeal is whether the Board abused its discretion in finding that Barnes failed to show due diligence or good cause for the delay in filing his petition for review. The Board's regulations do not provide any specific criteria for determining when good cause has been shown. We have recognized, however, that there are several nonexclusive factors that may be considered, including:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the length of the delay; whether appellant was notified of the time limit or was otherwise aware of it; the existence of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant which affected his ability to comply with the time limits; the degree to which negligence by the appellant has been shown to be present or absent; circumstances which show that any neglect involved is excusable neglect; a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune; and the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency which would result from waiver of the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Herring v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 778 F.3d 1011, 1013-14 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980)); <span class="Italic">see also Walls v. Merit Sys.</span> <span class="Italic">Prot. Bd</span>., 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("We previously have recognized the efficacy of the Alonzo factors in good cause determinations by the Board."). We have explained that "excusable neglect" is "neglect that a reasonably prudent person might manifest under the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1582 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the petition for review was due on Friday, March 28, 2014. It is also undisputed that counsel for Barnes hand-delivered the petition to the Board's headquarters on Monday, March 31, 2014. The Board conceded that counsel was unable to access the e-Appeal system from Saturday through Monday following the Friday filing deadline, and determined that the filing delay of 3 days was "relatively brief." Notwithstanding the "brevity of the delay," the Board found that, Barnes "ha[d] not shown good cause for his failure to meet the filing deadline" because: (1) he is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative; (2) counsel's word count error "was avoidable"; and (3) counsel failed to submit a motion for an extension of time, which would have been timely filed on March 28, 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the facts of this case support a finding of good cause to excuse the untimely filing. First, although the Board characterized it as a 3-day delay, Barnes' petition was due on a Friday and it was the Board's own computer failures that prevented a filing the next day. While the Board faults Barnes' counsel for not having resorted to traditional delivery methods on Saturday when he realized the computerized filing system's failures were not going to be timely corrected, we find that position untenable. The Board has instituted an electronic filing system which it requires all counsel to become familiar with and employ. Requiring alternative efforts on a Saturday once it was clear the Board was not going to fix its filing system is not reasonable in these circumstances. We, thus, conclude that the filing was only one day late. That the delay was only one day does not necessarily mean that it is excusable, however. <span class="Italic">See Skaggs v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 364 F. App'x 623, 627 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (affirming a Board decision that found a one-day delay in filing was inexcusable where the delay was the result of negligence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that "[t]he appellant need not show an utter impossibility, but only that the delay was excusable in light of the particular facts and attending circumstances where diligence or ordinary prudence has been exercised." <span class="Italic">Herring</span>, 778 F.3d at 1014 (quoting <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532, 534 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). Counsel for Barnes admitted to the Board that he "should have considered both [the page limit and the word count] requirements in tandem as he drafted the petition." When he realized that the petition was too long, counsel began editing it to comply with the Board's regulations before filing. The undisputed evidence shows that he tried to submit the petition via the Board's e-Appeal system both over the weekend and on Monday morning, but was unable to do so because the system was down. At oral argument, counsel for the Board conceded that these attempts to electronically file the petition showed signs of diligence. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Argument at 16:53-58, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2015-3018.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2015-3018.mp3</a> ("Certainly there were signs of diligence. The attempts to e-file were signs of diligence."). And, when asked what would have happened if counsel for Barnes had submitted the petition that exceeded the word count on Friday, the Board's counsel explained that the Clerk of the Board would have rejected it as non-compliant and given him additional time to submit a compliant petition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19:03-39.[2] Thus, it was counsel's efforts to file a fully compliant petition that rendered the petition one day late, and which the Board believes can justify depriving Barnes of the opportunity to have his petition considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;At oral argument, counsel for the Board indicated that "[t]he Clerk has the option to reject a noncomplying brief, so if it had looked at the brief and did a word count and said this is way too long...they could have rejected it and said you have two days to resubmit." And when asked whether filing the noncompliant brief would have given counsel for Barnes "the time to fix his word count," the Board's counsel responded "if he had filed on Friday, Your Honor, yes."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, given the minimal delay, counsel's attempts to bring the petition into compliance with the Board's regulations, the fact that the Board's preferred filing method was unavailable, and counsel's concession that a noncompliant filing would have given Barnes additional time in which to file a compliant one, we conclude that the delay was excusable. Although the Board has discretion in determining whether there is good cause for delay, "the principles of justice and good conscience" weigh in favor of finding good cause for the delay under the particular circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1582; <span class="Italic">see also Jones v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 256 F. App'x 353, 356 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (applying "the principles of justice and good conscience" and concluding that the Board abused its discretion in finding an appeal untimely where there was a one-month delay in filing, but there were significant circumstances beyond the petitioner's control "that undoubtedly affected his ability to supervise his attorney's compliance with the filing deadline").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An electronic PFR filing that was initiated on time but completed a couple months late (when the appellant discovered the problem) was allowed, <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Army</span>, 115 MSPR 296, 300 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2010 MSPB 235 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The date of a filing by e-filing is "the date of electronic submission." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(1). We find that the appellant did not file his petition for review by the December 28, 2009 deadline because he did not actually complete all of the steps necessary for an electronic submission when he visited the Board's e-filing site on December 17, 2009. <span class="Italic">See Rodgers v</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 5 (2007). Nevertheless, we find that the appellant's statement and the Board's e-Appeal Event Log show that on December 17, 2009, 11 days before his appeal was due, the appellant created a petition for review on the e-filing section of the Board's website<span class="Italic">. See Boykin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (finding that the Board's records showed that an e-Appeal was created on May 1, 2006, supporting the appellant's representative's statement that he attempted to e-file on the May 1, 2006 filing deadline). The appellant did not file this pleading on December 17, 2009, however, because he did not complete the electronic submission. The appellant ultimately filed his petition for review on February 24, 2010, after he contacted the Board and became aware that he had not yet filed his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Noting that it is possible to exit the Board's e-filing website without receiving a clear warning that an appellant has not yet filed his pleading, the Board has found good cause for an untimely filing under circumstances where the individual could reasonably have believed that he filed his pleading in a timely fashion. <span class="Italic">See Lamb v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 9 (2009); <span class="Italic">Rodgers</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9. Furthermore, the appellant acted with due diligence by contacting the Board when he did not receive a response to his appeal and by refiling the appeal on February 24, 2010, when he became aware there was a problem. <span class="Italic">Lamb</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Livingston v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). Thus, we find, under the particular circumstances of this case, that the appellant has shown good cause for filing his petition for review beyond the deadline because he attempted to make a timely electronic filing, because he was able to exit the Board's website without receiving a clear warning that he had not yet filed his pleading, and he acted with due diligence in submitting the relevant documents when he became aware of the problem.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's representative claims that he erroneously saved the petition for review in the Board's e-Appeal system as a draft on December 23, 2013, instead of submitting it. Under limited circumstances, the Board will excuse delays in filing caused by difficulties encountered with the e-Appeal system. <span class="Italic">E.g., Salazar v.

However, we do not find that the appellant's failure to complete the submission is excusable in this instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the Board's e-Appeal logs, the appellant's representative initially created and saved a version of the petition for review in the e-Appeal system on December 21, 2013. He logged onto the system again on December 23, 2013, but neither revised nor submitted the petition. The appellant's representative has represented him throughout the process. Further, from the time he filed his appeal, the appellant and his representative have both been registered e-filers. Prior to filing the petition for review, the representative successfully filed four pleadings in e-Appeal. According to the e-Appeal database, after each filing, the e-Appeal system generated an email within minutes to the appellant, his representative, and the agency's representative, advising them of the new pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, when an individual saves a draft petition for review in the e-Appeal system, the system automatically generates an email to him on each of the following 3 calendar days warning that the pleading has not yet been submitted. After the appellant's representative saved his draft petition on December 21, 2013, he would have received reminders on December 22, 23, and 24, 2013. The representative should have realized that he had not successfully filed the appeal when he received the last of these three notifications on December 24, 2013, the day after he alleges he believed he had filed the petition for review. However, he did not submit the petition for review until January 2, 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given their familiarity with the e-Appeal system, due diligence and ordinary prudence required that the appellant and his representative follow up to determine the status of the petition for review when they did not receive an email advising the parties that it had been filed as they had for their past Board submissions, and when the appellant's representative received an email on December 24, 2013, warning him that his December 21, 2013 draft petition for review was not yet submitted. <span class="Italic">Compare Walker v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2008) (declining to excuse a delay in filing where the appellant's attorney changed her email address without notifying the Board and did not contact the Board until 30 days after learning that the initial decision was issued), <span class="Italic">with Boykin v.

However, the petition for review was not filed until 11 days after it was originally drafted on December 21, 2013, and 7 days after it was due. Although the length of the delay was relatively short, the appellant has not shown any circumstances beyond his control such as unavoidable casualty or misfortune that affected his ability to comply with the time limits. <span class="Italic">See Moses v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 68, 69-70 (1982) (declining to excuse a 5-day delay requested based on a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's inability to see an attorney or to understand his appeal rights, and his failure to notice the deadline for filing a petition for review set forth in the initial decision); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981) (an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the petition was not accompanied by a motion that showed good cause for its untimely filing. Unless the Board has previously granted an extension, an untimely petition for review must be accompanied by such a motion, which must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement that includes the reasons for failing to request an extension before the deadline for the submission, and a specific and detailed description of the circumstances (g). After receiving the petition for review, the Board provided the appellant with notice of these requirements and instructed him to file the motion and accompanying documents on or before January 23, 2014, or the Board may dismiss his petition as untimely. The appellant's response to the Board's notice was 1 day late and did not include a sufficient explanation for the untimeliness of the petition.</p>

However, we find that the appellant's failure to complete the submission of the petition for review is not excusable in this instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the Board's e-Appeal logs, the appellant initially started a pleading on July 27, 2016, but did not submit a petition. Although she reentered the system on August 1, 2016, the deadline for filing a petition for review, she did not submit her petition on that date. She did submit three tickets to the Board's Information Resources Management technical support group on August 3, 2016, and one of those tickets appears to be an attempt to file her petition for review using a ticket. However, by that date the petition was untimely. Prior to filing the petition for review, the appellant successfully filed pleadings in the e-Appeal system. According to the e-Appeal database, after each filing, the e-Appeal system generated an email within minutes to the appellant and her representative, if she had one, advising them of the new pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given her familiarity with the e-Appeal system, due diligence and ordinary prudence required that the appellant promptly follow up to determine the status of the petition for review when she did not receive an email advising her that it had been filed as she had for her past Board submissions. The appellant's tickets submitted to e-Appeal technical support suggest that she was aware that her petition had not been filed successfully. Nonetheless, the appellant did not file her petition for review until 8 days after August 3, 2016, when by her own actions she knew or should have known that she had not filed her petition for review in the e-Appeal system. The appellant has not shown any circumstances beyond her control such as unavoidable casualty or misfortune that affected her ability to comply with the time limits to file a petition for review, and to file immediately after she was aware that her petition had not been successfully filed. <span class="Italic">Livingston v.
