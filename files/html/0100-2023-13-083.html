<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-83"><span class="space">D.</span> ENFORCED LEAVE; CONSTRUCTIVE SUSPENSION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not exercise jurisdiction over disputes concerning annual or sick leave. The Board does exercise jurisdiction over disciplinary suspensions. Agencies occasionally use adverse action procedures to require leave usage, or to compel enforced leave status, and then the employee has an appeal to the Board if jurisdictional requirements are met. The Board then reviews the enforced leave under the "efficiency of the service" statutory standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cloonan v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3292) (employee was placed on enforced leave "because psychiatric reports by two physicians indicated that 'he is no longer psychiatrically fit for duty'"). In our discussion, the terms "enforced leave" and "constructive suspension" are often used interchangeably. [Refer to MSPB's 2008 "Information Sheet No. 11: Enforced Leave" at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/Enforced_Leave.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/Enforced_Leave.htm</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee leaves work for medical or other reasons and is then not paid, there may be a constructive suspension appeal--depending on the circumstances--but that is a situation distinct from the agency's affirmative act of placing an employee into leave status. Doctrinal confusion over the years concerning the jurisdictional requisites of enforced leave versus constructive suspensions was eliminated, for the time being, by <span class="Italic">Abbott v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ABBOTT_MARY_A_DC_0752_12_0366_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1048487.pdf">121 MSPR 294</a>, 296-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-11, 2014 MSPB 47 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2053"></span>On January 6, 2012, the agency proposed to place the appellant on enforced leave because there was no available work within her medical restrictions. After granting the appellant an opportunity to reply to the notice, by letter dated February 6, 2012, the agency issued a final decision effecting the enforced leave action against her on February 8, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we recently explained in <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397 (2013), the Board has long recognized that certain leaves of absence may also be appealable under chapter 75 as constructive suspensions. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, the appellant alleged that leave that appeared to be voluntary actually was not. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8 n.3. Such appeals typically involve employee-initiated absences in which the appellant alleges that: (1) she lacked a meaningful choice, and (2) the absence was caused by the agency's improper actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11; <span class="Italic">see Boudousquie v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (an agency's misleading statements that the appellant must request leave without pay status may support a finding of constructive suspension); <span class="Italic">Peoples v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (1999) (involving allegations of constructive suspension on the basis that the appellant's absences were the result of intolerable working conditions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In constructive adverse action appeals, nonfrivolous allegations do not establish jurisdiction; rather, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the action was involuntary to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Heath v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 6 (2007); <span class="Italic">see Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The jurisdictional issue in such appeals is often dispositive. That is, if the appellant fails to meet her burden of establishing by preponderant evidence that she was constructively suspended, the appeal will be dismissed because the Board lacks jurisdiction over appeals of employees' voluntary actions. <span class="Italic">See Perez</span>, 931 F.2d at 854 (placement of an employee in a nonpay, absence without leave status, even for longer than 14 days, was not an action appealable to the Board because the employee voluntarily absented himself, and it was his, not the agency's choice, to remain away from work after his request for paid sick leave was denied). Because such constructive suspensions are often effected without notice, however, if the appellant establishes jurisdiction, the Board will reverse the agency's action on due process grounds without proceeding to the merits. <span class="Italic">E.g., Crutch v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 12 (2013); <span class="Italic">Bannister v. General Services Administration</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 362 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal, however, is not a case in which an appellant alleges that leave that appears to be voluntary actually is not. Rather, it concerns the agency's placing the appellant on enforced leave. In <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987), our reviewing court held that placement of an employee on enforced leave due to his medical condition, which prevented him from performing in any available position, constituted an appealable suspension of more than 14 days.[*] Subsequently, however, the Board, in several cases beginning with <span class="Italic">Childers v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 486, 488-89 (1988), mischaracterized <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> as holding that "placement in enforced leave status for more than fourteen days, based on alleged physical or mental disability, constitutes a <span class="Italic">constructive</span> suspension appealable to the Board." (Emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Rutherford v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 9 (2009); <span class="Italic">White v.

As a result, the Board has adjudicated many claims involving an agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave as alleged constructive suspensions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crutch</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 6 (an employee's involuntary absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay or forces her to take leave that she did not intend to use is a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Although appealable suspensions of more than 14 days must be "disciplinary," our reviewing court has held that suspensions that are</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We now clarify that an agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than 14 days constitutes an appealable suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, 832 F.2d at 599-600; <span class="Italic">Norrington v.

To the extent that the Board has in past decisions adjudicated such appeals using the jurisdictional framework for constructive suspensions, those decisions are overruled. The suspensions under these circumstances are not "constructive," and the case law concerning constructive suspensions is inapplicable. Rather, to sustain such suspensions, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the charged conduct occurred, that a nexus exists between the conduct and service efficiency, and that the penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Norrington</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see Pope v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as stated above, the administrative judge adjudicated the appellant's claim that she was placed on enforced leave using the Board's framework for adjudicating appeals of alleged constructive suspensions. Because there is no dispute that the agency placed the appellant in an enforced leave status for more than 14 days against her will, the agency's action constitutes an appealable suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. Moreover, the agency has provided the appellant a proposal notice and a final decision on the proposed action. Therefore, we REMAND this appeal for adjudication on the merits. In addition, because we have determined that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal, the administrative judge should adjudicate the appellant's affirmative defenses of due process, harmful procedural error, disability discrimination, and disparate treatment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant reasserts her argument below that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal because the agency placed her on enforced leave for more than 14 days. For the following reasons, we find that the administrative judge erroneously construed and analyzed the appellant's claim as a constructive suspension instead of an appealable suspension. As noted above, the record reflects that after the appellant returned to work from previously scheduled annual leave, the agency told her to leave work because it could find no work within her medical restrictions. Under such circumstances, the appellant's absence does not appear voluntary, but instead constitutes an appealable suspension within the Board's jurisdiction because the agency placed her in an enforced leave status for more than 14 days against her will. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Abbott</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because a tenured Federal employee has a property interest in continued employment, an agency is prohibited from placing an appellant on enforced leave for more than 14 days without providing the due process required under the Fifth Amendment. <span class="italic">Cleveland Board of Education v.

An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with proper notice and an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives her of her property right in her employment constitutes an abridgement of her constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Here, the agency did not provide the appellant with notice of any proposed enforced leave or an opportunity to be heard, either before or after it imposed the enforced leave, and the record reflects that she was in an LWOP status for at least 400 hours. Consequently, we reverse the agency's enforced leave action. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Martin</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 11 (reversing the agency's suspension action because it violated the appellant's constitutional due process rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board offered a footnote in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0343-I-2 (NP 12/5/2014), differentiating enforced leave and a constructive suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[3]&#x2003;Although the appellant in this case, and others in earlier Board decisions, have treated the terms "enforced leave" and "constructive suspension" as if they were synonymous, they actually are not. In <span class="Italic">Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2014), the Board clarified the difference between enforced leave, which is an action that is involuntary on its face and is appealable under chapter 75 as a suspension if it lasts for longer than 14 days, and a constructive suspension, which often appears to be a voluntary action but actually is not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> concerned enforced leave. The requisites of an appealable constructive suspension were noted in <span class="Italic">Bean v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Like involuntary resignations, removals, and reductions in pay or grade, involuntary leaves of absence may be appealable to the Board under chapter 75 as constructive suspensions.[3] The Board has found jurisdiction over constructive suspensions in a variety of situations.[4] <span class="Italic">See <span id="Page_2054"></span>Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Although various fact patterns may give rise to an appealable constructive suspension, all constructive suspension claims, and indeed all constructive adverse action claims whatsoever, have two things in common: (1) the employee lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived the employee of that choice. Assuming that the jurisdictional requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 are otherwise met, proof of these two things is sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This Opinion and Order pertains only to <span class="Italic">involuntary</span> leave constructive suspensions. It does not pertain to <span class="Italic">enforced</span> leave constructive suspensions. Although they share the same name, they are analytically unrelated. Enforced leave suspensions are called "constructive" because they do not fit the literal statutory definition of a "suspension" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2), yet they have the same effect. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Involuntary leave suspensions are called "constructive" because they appear to be voluntary actions but are not. The jurisdictional analysis is completely different between the two, and this Opinion and Order is not intended to address the enforced leave situation. We use the term "constructive suspension" only with reference to the involuntary leave situation unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;There is a line of cases beginning with <span class="Italic">McNamee-Marrero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (1999), which state that constructive suspension claims arise in "two situations" (one of them being the equivocal "enforced leave" situation discussed above in &#x00B6; 8 n.3). This statement is misleading. As explained in <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 8 (2010), the Board has recognized several fact patterns that may give rise to an involuntary constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Another line of Board cases states that the dispositive issue in a constructive suspension appeal is whether the agency or the employee initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rutherford v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 187, &#x00B6; 21 (1999). As the Board suggested in <span class="Italic">Crutch v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 6 (2013), this is true only in enforced leave-type constructive suspension appeals. The very essence of an involuntary leave-type constructive suspension, such as this one, is that the absence was employee-initiated. The Board has occasionally attempted to apply this "initiation" standard to an involuntary leave-type appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 8. Needless to say, this does not further the analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board remanded <span class="Italic">Bean</span> for analysis of factors traditionally considered in a constructive suspension appeal--based on an assertion that the leave taken resulted from the failure of the agency properly to accommodate a disability, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the essence of the appellant's claim is that he was compelled to take leave because his only alternative was to work after dark, in violation of his doctor's orders, <span class="Italic">and</span> that the agency forced him into this untenable position by improperly taking him off of the tour 2 day shift and otherwise failing to accommodate his condition. We find that the appellant's allegations, if proven, could establish that he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter and that it was the agency's improper actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 8. The jurisdictional prerequisites of chapter 75 otherwise appear to be satisfied because the appellant is a preference eligible Postal Service employee with 1 year of current continuous service and his absence lasted for more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii), 7512(2). Therefore, under the principles set forth above and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Crutch</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to an appealable constructive suspension. We therefore remand this appeal for further development of the record, including the submission of the agency's file under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.25 and a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 84, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the relevant issues will likely include whether the appellant's medical condition would have compelled a reasonable person to take a leave of absence rather than reporting for duty on tour 3 (if indeed this fact is still in dispute), whether the agency's refusal to allow the appellant to remain on tour 2 was improper, and whether the agency improperly failed to offer the appellant an alternative accommodation that would have allowed him to continue working. In this regard, we note that the agency invoked the collective bargaining agreement as its reason for moving the appellant off of tour 2. We direct the administrative judge's attention to <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 402-06 (2002), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Question 31, both of which explain that an accommodation that would violate a collectively bargained seniority system would generally be unreasonable unless the appellant can show that "special circumstances" exist. In any event, based on the appellant's petition for review, it appears to be still in dispute whether retaining him on tour 2 would have violated the collective bargaining agreement in the first place. Moreover, the record has not yet been fully developed as to whether there were reasonable accommodations available other than retaining the appellant on tour 2.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may voluntarily accept leave status at the agency's suggestion or his own, and there is then no appealable action (unless the employee seeks to return to the work site and the agency precludes his return), <span class="Italic">Tardio v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 10 (2007).

Department of the Army</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 5 (2008).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Constructive suspension claims generally arise in two situations: (1) When an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform; or (2) when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">Sage</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Hamiel v.

In the latter situation, when an employee requests work within his medical restrictions, and the agency is bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available work to the employee, but fails to do so, his continued absence for over fourteen days constitutes an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). Once an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes a nonfrivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicated his willingness to work, and that the agency prevented him from returning to work, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions, or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it. <span class="Italic">Id.; Baker</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 693.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]onstructive situations "may arise in two situations": (1) when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform, or (2) when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">Rutherford</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9. However, these are not the only situations in which a constructive suspension may arise. The Board has also recognized that proof of intolerable working conditions compelling an employee to be absent may in some circumstances support a finding of constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Peoples v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 7 (1999). In addition, we have recognized that an agency's misleading statement, upon which an employee relies to his detriment, may support a finding of constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Boudousquie v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). The last scenario is especially relevant given the appellant's claim that he was deceived into applying for light duty instead of limited duty. On any theory, the dispositive inquiry is the same: whether the employee's absence was voluntary or involuntary. <span class="Italic">Holloway v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 993 F.2d 219, 221 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the administrative judge misstated the second jurisdictional theory as it applies to this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680 (1996), the Board held that when an employee requests work within his medical restrictions, and the agency is bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available work to the employee, but fails to do so, his continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 692. Once an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes a non-frivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicated his willingness to work, and that the agency prevented him from returning to work, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions, or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 693. If the agency meets its burden, then the appellant must present sufficient rebuttal evidence to meet his overall burden of persuasion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At the hearing, the administrative judge implied that the Board's jurisdiction over the case turns on whether the agency met its burden of establishing that no light duty was available. However, the appellant alleged below that he suffered an on-the-job injury which may have entitled him to limited duty, as opposed to light duty. The holding of <span class="Italic">Baker</span> applies not only to the alleged denial of light duty, but also to cases in which an appellant alleges that the agency failed to provide available limited duty to which he was entitled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 13 (2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As with many doctrines of Board jurisdiction that have evolved on what amounts to a common law basis, the analysis of enforced leave as an appealable matter has undergone twists and turns, and it cannot be said that the current law is stable or clear. If an agency places an employee off-duty and requires the employee to use up his or her accrued leave or places him in a nonpay status, the question arises of whether the resulting appeal concerns leave administration or whether the appeal is from a constructive disciplinary suspension. The jurisdictional analysis became complex as the Board sought to ensure that agencies could use enforced leave without adverse action procedures to remove individuals from agency premises who were too ill or too disruptive to continue their work for some indefinite period of time. An OPM regulation that limited the right of agencies to use enforced leave for individuals on whose behalf agencies initiated psychiatric fitness for duty examinations made matters more complex. Added to the analytical problems are employees who voluntarily take sick leave and who are then precluded from returning to the worksite until they demonstrate their fitness for duty. The OPM regulation was eventually dropped, but the intricacies of the enforced leave jurisdictional analysis remained. The Federal Circuit issued several decisions, first interpreting the OPM regulation governing the use of enforced leave with agency-initiated retirement applications, and then addressing enforced leave without regard to the regulation. These court decisions refashioned the law governing enforced leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency will now generally be required to follow adverse action procedures before requiring an individual to assume an enforced leave status. The normal issues in Board appeals on enforced leave will be, first, whether the agency followed adverse action procedures (notice, opportunity to respond) and, if so, whether there was good cause to require the leave. Our discussion concerns agency action that either places an employee in a nonpay status or requires the employee involuntarily to use annual or sick leave<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Minnis v. VA</span>, 42 MSPR 460, 462 (1989) (constructive suspension claim arose from an assertion that the appellant was involuntarily placed on sick leave). For the Board to have appellate jurisdiction over enforced leave, the employee must have the tenure necessary to invoke that jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Valenzuela v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 477, 481 (1991) (appellant could not appeal enforced leave because he was a nonpreference eligible excepted service employee); <span class="Italic">Suson v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 21, 22 n.1 (1982) (no jurisdiction existed over enforced leave appeal by a nonpreference eligible employee of the USPS). [Refer to Chapter 13 for retaliatory personnel actions, including significant changes of position responsibilities, within the Board's jurisdiction in "<a href="0100-2023-09-018.html#sec2-19">Individual Right of Action</a>" cases.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Placement of an employee on administrative leave is not an appealable adverse action. It does not involve both loss of duties and loss of pay. <span class="Italic">Beagles v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3173); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Henry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 902 F.2d 949 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">DeShields v. EEOC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3197); <span class="Italic">Patton v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 21, 22-23 (1992) (appeal from enforced administrative leave: since the appellant was never in a nonpay status, the agency action did not constitute a suspension); <span class="Italic">Kuhn v. FDIC</span>, 48 MSPR 393, 398 (1991). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Dixon v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 171, 175 (1995) (Board may have jurisdiction if, after a period of unappealable administrative leave, the employee is forced to take sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay for a period exceeding 14 days); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 668, 671 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (appeal was not mooted by a retroactive conversion of its status to administrative leave if the appellant was on enforced leave for more than 14 days and enforced was leave was not completely rescinded). Forced idling of an employee--even with pay on administrative leave or otherwise--could constitute whistleblowing reprisal. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a> on prohibited personnel practices.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit confirmed the Board's views about MSPB jurisdiction over administrative leave, <span class="Italic">Henry v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3226):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Henry contends that placement in an administrative leave status resulted in a constructive suspension due to lost overtime pay, work experience, job training, and the psychological benefits associated with work. In support, Henry relies on <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. United States Postal Service</span>, 3 F.3d 1522 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Henry argues that <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span> held that it is inappropriate to limit the benefits of employment to compensation alone. Therefore, Henry concludes that the board has jurisdiction over his appeal because the agency's action resulted in a constructive suspension when it denied him the additional benefits normally associated with work. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2056"></span>A federal employee is provided the right to petition to the board for review of any "suspension of more than 14 days." 5 USC 7512(2) (1994). The term "suspension" is defined by 5 USC 7501(2) as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status <span class="Italic">without</span> <span class="Italic">duties and pay</span> [emphasis added]." Here, the board properly determined that placement of an employee in an administrative leave status, without loss of basic pay, is not a suspension within the board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, 902 F.2d at 953-54 ("Since her pay was not reduced, there is simply no adverse action from which the petitioner can appeal to contest her placement on administrative leave.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Henry's reliance on <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span>, the board reversed an agency decision and granted interim relief, requiring the agency to return DeLaughter to work. <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span>, 3 F.3d at 1523. In response, the agency placed DeLaughter on administrative leave rather than returning him to work. In our decision on appeal, we acknowledged that there are "many benefits...which may accrue to an employee who is actually present and working, instead of being away from the work place while on administrative leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1524. However, we merely held that an agency must explicitly make a determination of undue disruption before it may place an employee on administrative leave <span class="Italic">once the</span> <span class="Italic">board has awarded interim relief</span>. Our holding did not modify or overrule our prior decisions in which we held that placement of an employee in an administrative leave status pending removal procedures, without loss of basic pay, is not an appealable suspension and is beyond the board's jurisdiction. Here, Henry was placed on administrative leave with pay pending an agency investigation. The board did not grant interim relief requiring the agency to return Henry to work as in <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span>. Therefore, the board lacked jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-218.html#sec1-216">Leave Dispute; Administrative Leave; Notice, Investigation Leave</a>," regarding jurisdiction.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To constitute enforced leave, the agency must place the appellant in a nonduty status with interruption of regular pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Donahue v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 387, 395 &#x00B6; 21 (2005) (appellant acknowledged that he was "still on the agency rolls"); <span class="Italic">Divens v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 279, 281 (1988) (Board lacked jurisdiction over a claim that an employee lost wages due to a work-related injury; "appellant did not dispute the agency's assertion that the appellant was always in a duty and pay status following her injury"); <span class="Italic">DeShields</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. An employee on an intermittent schedule may allege a constructive suspension through enforced leave if she specifically argues that her placement in a temporary nonduty, nonpay status was not in accordance with the conditions established at the time of her appointment but was for disciplinary reasons. <span class="Italic">Rison v. DOD</span>, 73 MSPR 390, 394 (1997). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-130.html#sec1-129">Seasonal; On-Call.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some parallels exist between enforced leave and indefinite suspensions. Enforced leave, often noticeless, is generally imposed because the appellant is unable to work because of physical or mental illness. An indefinite suspension, usually initiated through a notice and reply right, is generally imposed pending investigation of the appellant's involvement in criminal activity or eligibility for continuation of a security clearance. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-119.html#sec6-118">Security Clearance or Other Investigation</a>," for indefinite suspension and enforced leave appeals arising out of problems with security clearances; refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-318.html#sec8-296">Medical Inability to Perform</a>"; refer to <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a> for remedies in enforced leave appeals.]</p>
