<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-63"><span class="space">i.</span> Whistleblowing Reprisal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may pursue an involuntary retirement claim as a personnel action in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Agee-Long v. GSA,</span> SF-0752-17-0518-I-1 (NP 1/20/2023) (citing <span class="Italic">Mastrullo v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 123 MSPR 110, &#x00B6; 10 (2015)). When a retirement is allegedly forced, with some involvement asserted of whistleblower reprisal, the appellant should demonstrate that traditional tests are met as to the involuntary nature of the action, as <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, AT-1221-11-0062-B-2 (NP 9/22/2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, 645 Fed. Appx. 987 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), an IRA whistleblower case expressed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By focusing on whether the appellant proved that his retirement was involuntary, and thus a personnel action within the Board's jurisdiction, without making a determination as to whether the appellant met the standard for proving that his disclosure was a contributing factor in such a personnel action and whether the agency met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the disclosure, the administrative judge's analysis was consistent with holdings of the court and the Board in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmyer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that the ultimate issue in both a constructive discharge claim based on whistleblowing reprisal and a constructive discharge claim based on discrimination is whether the employee retired under such intolerable working conditions that her retirement constituted a constructive discharge); <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18 (2004); <span class="Italic">cf. Pickens v. Social Security Administration</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 6 (2001) (finding that when allegations of discrimination and reprisal are alleged in connection with a determination of voluntariness, such evidence of discrimination or retaliation may only be addressed insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense); <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996) (concluding that evidence of discrimination may be considered only in terms of the standard for voluntariness in a particular situation--not whether such evidence meets the test for proof of discrimination or reprisal established under Title VII).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming, the Federal Circuit determined that if the employee's retirement is deemed voluntary, that is, it is not coerced, the whistleblowing analysis need not be further developed, <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, 645 Fed. Appx. 987, 991 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Carson also contends that the Board failed to determine whether the whistleblowing disclosure was a "contributing factor" to an adverse personnel action, and failed to require the agency to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have had taken the same personnel action absent the disclosure. In order to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, however, the claimant must prove: (1) that he made a protected disclosure, (2) that he was subject to an adverse personnel action, and (3) that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Because the Board determined that Mr. Carson voluntarily retired, his claim fails because he was not subject to an adverse personnel action. Therefore, there was no reason for the Board to consider the contributing factor element or the agency's possible affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swinford v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 107 MSPR 433, 438 &#x00B6; 10, 2007 MSPB 296 (2007) (appellant stated a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntary retirement based on whistleblowing allegations that allegedly resulted in reprisal causing him to become ill; the agency denied him leave, made it clear that his retirement was desired, and effectively placed him in a position of taking retirement to secure income).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burke v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 434, 439 (1992), summarized the analysis of a claim that an appellant was forced to retire as a result of reprisal for whistleblowing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant also has alleged that his retirement resulted in part from retaliation for his whistleblowing. Allegations such as this, when made in support of an assertion that the agency coerced the appellant's resignation or retirement, should be considered in the same manner as allegations that the coercion was based on discrimination. That is, the administrative judge should consider them only for the limited purpose of determining whether they support a finding of coercion. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not identified the whistleblower activity in which he allegedly engaged, nor has he otherwise shown how his retirement could have resulted from retaliation from this alleged activity. The mere allegation that Ehlen retaliated against him for whistleblower activities is insufficient to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that his working conditions were made so intolerable by the alleged retaliation as to render his retirement involuntary by reason of coercion.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleged that he was abruptly removed from the transition team, and from the Executive Leadership Council and the Union/Management Council, and was replaced on those bodies by an individual who was later selected to fill the reengineered position that he had occupied. He alleged that his supervisor told the entire workforce that he would be leaving, even though he had initiated no such action, and that Captain Banghart and Ms. Mauck bypassed the appellant to deal with employees who reported to the appellant. The appellant alleged that he was not selected for his own reengineered position, even though he was the best qualified; nor was he selected for lateral assignment to any other position in the organization. He alleged that Captain Banghart sent him home in October 1997 on undocumented administrative leave, and subsequently sent him on an undocumented detail to another organization where he remained, without any substantive duties to perform, until his retirement in February 1998. In addition, the appellant alleged that the agency refused to process his grievance, and that Captain Banghart told him that he did not care if his grievance had merit, that he (Captain Banghart) would ensure that the appellant never realized any benefit from it.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee-initiated action such as a retirement is presumed to be voluntary, and as such, is not appealable. <span class="Italic">Atkins v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of</span> Commerce, 81 M.S.P.R. 246 &#x00B6; 6 (1999). An appellant, however, is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an alleged involuntary separation if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness<span class="Italic">. Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Locke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 283, 288 (1994).

<p class="Block-Quote1">When allegations of discrimination and reprisal for either prior EEO activity or whistleblowing activity are alleged in connection with a determination of voluntariness, such evidence of discrimination or reprisal may only be addressed insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Pickens v.

Similarly, where the appellant has alleged that intolerable working conditions led to his retirement, the Board has held that the appropriate test for involuntariness is "whether under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign [or retire]." <span class="Italic">McCray,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 154 &#x00B6; 8 (quoting <span class="Italic">Heining v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's submissions below show that he raised a nonfrivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary so as to warrant a jurisdictional hearing in his appeal. The appellant argued below, and reasserts in his petition for review, that Offutt harassed and retaliated against him, creating a hostile work environment from the time of his assignment to ERS in August 1998 until his early retirement in March 1999. Specifically, the appellant asserts, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Offutt: (1) Eliminated key duties of his ERS Director of ISD position immediately upon his reassignment to the position; (2) required him to meet with her every Monday morning and file weekly reports although she did not impose this requirement upon other Senior Executive Service managers; (3) excluded him from necessary meetings; (4) issued him the lowest "fully successful" annual performance rating that he had ever received as a Senior Executive Service manager, refused to explain the rating, insisted that he sign the rating although she had not signed it, and reprimanded him for copying her unsigned version of the rating; (5) threatened to fire him, yelled at him, and publicly criticized him on several occasions before subordinates; and (6) stated that she wanted to remove older males from ERS. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed that Offutt's conduct was motivated by: Reprisal for his whistleblowing, beginning in February 1998, about Hefferan's mismanagement of grant funds, because Offutt and Hefferan were close friends; retaliation for his prior EEO activity, beginning in July 1998, that culminated with his February 1999 EEO complaint naming both Hefferan and Offutt as discriminatory officials; and Offutt's desire to force older males out of ERS. As to Hefferan, the appellant asserted that she retaliated against him when she reduced his administrative duties as CSREES Deputy Administrator beginning in February 1998, and later reassigned him to ERS in August 1998, which was the least significant Service within the agency. Further, the appellant asserted that Hefferan contributed to his low October 1998 performance rating in reprisal for his whistleblowing about her mismanagement of research funds and in retaliation for his EEO activity against her. The appellant contended that, as a result of Offutt's and Hefferan's conduct, he suffered interrupted sleep, nightmares, headaches, a loss of appetite and depression. He also asserted that his psychologists recommended that he retire early because of his problems with his job and the imminent threat to his mental and physical health.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, we find that the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation that he retired involuntarily. <span class="Italic">See Pickens</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 525 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-14; <span class="Italic">Markon v.

<p class="Body-Text">The need to consider a history of events preceding a retirement alleged to have been compelled by whistleblowing reprisal was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. USDA</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1338-1343 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Shoaf v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Shoaf began his career with the United States Forest Service (the "agency"), which is a part of the Department of Agriculture, in 1978 as a seasonal GS-3 Forest Technician in Idaho. Later that year, Shoaf commenced full-time employment with the agency as a GS-5 Timber Sale Officer. He was promoted to a GS-7 position and then to a GS-9 position as a Presale Forester by 1981, which he maintained until 1987. In 1987, Shoaf was promoted to a GS-11 position as a Forestry Systems Analyst in the agency's national headquarters in Washington, D.C. He was again promoted to a GS-12 position the following year. From 1978 through 1990, all of Shoaf's performance ratings were either "fully successful" or "outstanding." The agency also awarded Shoaf merit certificates in 1983, 1987, and 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In April 1990, Shoaf transferred from agency headquarters to the Ketchikan, Alaska area of the Tongass National Forest ("the Tongass"). By the time Shoaf went to the Tongass, he was well versed with federal statutes and regulations relating to timber sales.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shoaf was placed "on the Tongass" to head interdisciplinary teams ("IDTs") responsible for preparing large timber sales in southeast Alaska. In this position, Shoaf headed the IDT responsible for preparing the Central Prince of Wales ("CPOW") sale of old-growth forest. The CPOW sale was extremely controversial; it garnered significant governmental and media attention and fostered a substantial amount of litigation concerning its legality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his first year on the Tongass, Shoaf carried out his duties well and again received "fully successful" and "outstanding" performance ratings. After Shoaf's first year on the Tongass, he recognized several agency activities pertaining to the CPOW sale that he believed violated statutory strictures binding the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Between July 1991 and July 1993, Shoaf made several whistleblowing-type disclosures concerning timber management practices on the Tongass. In July 1991, Shoaf and his CPOW team produced and released a "falldown" report, which highlighted proposed logging activity outside of established project boundaries. Shoaf also advised David Rittenhouse, the Forest Supervisor who was Shoaf's second-level superior, that the 1991 "Notice of Intent"--which disclosed proposed agency action and possible alternatives to the public--contained disparities in the location and acreage of the CPOW sale. On December 13, 1992, Shoaf wrote a public comment letter in his capacity as a public citizen pertaining to the draft environmental impact statement ("DEIS") covering the CPOW project issued by the agency. In this letter, which was disseminated to the public, Shoaf stated that the proposal outlined in the DEIS would lead to an "unacceptable" reduction of sustained timber development <span id="Page_2017"></span>in the project area. Shoaf's public comment letter attracted national attention. United States Congressman George Miller, then Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, obtained a copy of Shoaf's letter and drafted a letter to Michael Espy, then Secretary-Designate of Agriculture, which pointed out Shoaf's concerns over the harvest rate in the Tongass region and requested an investigation of activity on the Tongass. Shoaf's public comment letter also attracted media attention. Further, in April 1993, Shoaf released another report he co-authored indicating that the agency's proposed "alternatives" contained "clearcut units" that exceeded the allowable limits. Additionally, prior to release of the CPOW environmental impact statement ("EIS"), Shoaf submitted a memorandum to the agency indicating that its decision to disregard the "multi-entry layout plan" in the EIS was undesirable. In several of the aforementioned disclosures, Shoaf alleged that the agency was violating statutory provisions, for example, directives of the National Energy Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4321-4347 (1994) and the National Forest Management Act of 1976, 16 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1600 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just after Shoaf began to call attention to activities he considered violative of governing statutes, the agency took numerous actions detrimental to Shoaf's career. For example, on August 1, 1991, two weeks after release of the "falldown" report, Rittenhouse orally reprimanded Shoaf at a meeting in front of agency managers and his IDT. During 1992, David Arrasmith, Shoaf's immediate supervisor at the time, twice indicated that he was considering and being urged by agency management to remove Shoaf from his position. Shortly after Shoaf's public comment letter regarding the DEIS was publicized, Arrasmith prohibited Shoaf and other IDT leaders from speaking directly to the media, which had previously been a responsibility of IDT leaders. In early 1993, Shoaf was stripped of his responsibility for coordinating public comments on the CPOW DEIS, even though the other IDT leaders on the Tongass retained such responsibility for their respective projects. In March 1993, the agency assigned a "co-IDT leader" to work with Shoaf on the CPOW project. In spring 1993, the agency removed Shoaf's responsibility for leading the preparation and recommendation of the "preferred alternative" for the final EIS. On April 1, 1993, Arrasmith, with approval from Rittenhouse, gave Shoaf his first "not fully successful" performance rating in fifteen years. On May 5, 1993, the agency eliminated Shoaf's involvement in a project concerning "clearcut size" in the CPOW project area. Also in 1993, Arrasmith informed Shoaf that he could not meet with governmental auditors investigating possible violations of the Tongass Timber Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 101-626, 104 Stat. 4426 (1990). Shoaf was also prevented from meeting with the Director of Timber Management from the agency's headquarters in May 1993, and he was not asked to attend a national forestry conference in August 1993, which was attended by the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, even though the other two IDT leaders on the Tongass attended these gatherings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to a reorganization effort in September 1993, the agency eliminated Shoaf's position. Shoaf voluntarily accepted a position as a "Special Projects Forester" with the timber staff in Ketchikan, Alaska under the supervision of Mr. Gene Eide. The agency created this non-supervisory position specifically for Shoaf; it did not exist prior to Shoaf's tenure and was abolished when he left that position. During portions of 1994, the agency provided him with absolutely no viable or meaningful assignments. Indeed, as of February 7, 1995, Shoaf indicated by letter to the Regional Forester, Mr. Phil Janek, that his last assignment had been given on November 2, 1994 and it lasted for a day and a half. Shoaf contends the agency deliberately "idled" him in an effort to persuade him to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 28, 1995, Shoaf applied for retirement in conjunction with a separation incentive program under the provisions of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-226, 108 Stat. 111 (1994). His resignation under that program became effective on March 31, 1995. On July 6, 1995, Shoaf filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"), alleging that retaliatory actions had been taken against him for making disclosures protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2308(b)(8) (1994). On May 8, 1996, the OSC issued a notice of termination of its inquiry into Shoaf's complaint. On October 31, 1996, Shoaf appealed to the MSPB, alleging that his resignation was involuntary and based on constructive discharge due to his whistleblowing activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, to determine whether Shoaf's resignation was involuntary, the administrative judge only considered activities transpiring after Shoaf transferred to the timber staff in September 1993. Based on that evidence, the administrative judge determined the agency's alleged efforts to "idle" Shoaf failed to constitute circumstances under which a reasonable person would be "forced" to resign. Therefore, the administrative judge concluded that Shoaf failed to show his separation was either a constructive removal action taken by the agency or that it was a "personnel action" under the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), and consequently held that the MSPB lacked jurisdiction over Shoaf's appeal. The administrative judge then indicated that Shoaf's request for corrective action based on events occurring prior to his September 1993 transfer was moot, because he failed to establish that he should be reinstated on the grounds that his resignation was involuntary. Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed Shoaf's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shoaf petitioned the MSPB for review of the initial decision. Two members of the three-member panel summarily denied his petition for review and entered a final order. Vice-Chair Slavet dissented. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;"Involuntary" Dismissal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A decision to resign or retire is presumed to be voluntary. <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587 (Ct. Cl. 1975); <span class="Italic">Staats v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1996). An employee who voluntarily resigns or retires has no right to appeal to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1123-24. The MSPB possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1124; <span class="Italic">Braun v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1995). That is, an involuntary resignation constitutes a constructive removal that is appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Mintzmyer v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we have recognized that the MSPB's jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged involuntary separation are "inextricably intertwined." <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986). If it is established that a resignation or retirement is involuntary, the MSPB not only has jurisdiction, "but also the employee wins on the merits and is entitled to reinstatement." <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employees typically ground involuntary resignation or retirement assertions on bases such as: the agency proposed or threatened an adverse action against the employee, <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1251-53 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); the agency misinformed or deceived the employee, <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984); or the agency coerced the employee to involuntarily resign or retire, for example, by creating working conditions so intolerable for the employee that he or she is driven to involuntarily resign or retire, <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1007-08. Shoaf's claim falls into the "coercion" category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general proposition, to establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion this court requires an employee to show: (1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. These guidelines were developed from the principles set forth by one of this court's predecessors in <span class="Italic">Fruhauf Southwest Garment Co. v. United States</span>, 111 F. Supp. 945, 951 (Ct. Cl. 1953). <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">McGucken v. United States</span>, 407 F.2d 1349, 1351 (Ct. Cl. 1969). In circumstances involving economic duress, the Fruhauf court recognized that it was "virtually impossible" to articulate a "clear-cut" definition of the law of duress. 111 F. Supp. at 951. Yet, pursuant to prior duress jurisprudence, the <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> court determined that the three aforementioned elements were common to all situations in which duress had been judicially discerned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The three-prong <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> test must be tailored to fit the circumstances of each case. We have repeatedly recognized, in light of the particulars of each case, that a reviewing tribunal should ultimately consider whether working conditions were made so intolerable by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Middleton</span>, 185 F.3d at 1379 ("The employee must present allegations of fact which, if proven, establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstance would feel coerced into resigning."); <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1574 ("[F]reedom of choice [is] the guiding principle [in an involuntariness determination]."); <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1007-08 ("To determine whether a resignation or retirement is voluntary, a court must examine 'the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice.'" (citations omitted)). For example, the first <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> element is inapplicable to most constructive discharge cases where no adverse action is currently pending; nevertheless, the appellant may still be coerced into an involuntary resignation based on a lack of free choice. <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008; <span class="Italic">Heining v. Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 521 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that we apply an objective standard in consideration of whether an employee involuntarily resigned or retired. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1007; <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d 587. That is, "[t]he employee must present allegations of fact, which, if proven, establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstance would feel coerced into resigning." <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2018"></span>To objectively determine whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign, a deciding tribunal must consider the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States</span>, 490 F.2d 928, 933 (Ct. Cl. 1974) ("This court has consistently examined the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice."); <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1574 ("To determine whether a resignation or retirement is voluntary, a court must examine the surrounding circumstances...." (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 941-42 (same); <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1007-08 (same); <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 519-20 ("[T]he voluntariness of the resignation or retirement [is] based on whether the totality of the circumstances supported the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter."). In other words, in measuring the voluntariness of an employee's resignation or retirement, all of the activities surrounding his or her resignation or retirement, even events not immediately preceding the leave of employ, must be considered. Indeed, this court has recently stated that "[i]n determining whether an alleged act of coercion caused an employee's involuntary retirement, a court <span class="Italic">need not limit</span> itself to any particular timeframe." <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Terban</span> we recognized that the most probative evidence of involuntariness "will usually be evidence in which there is a relatively short period of time between the employer's alleged coercive act[s] and the employee's retirement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While the <span class="Italic">Terban</span> court affirmed the Board's determination that the employee at issue failed to establish his retirement was involuntary based primarily on three events occurring during the fourteen month period immediately preceding retirement, the administrative judge considered all of the evidence submitted by the employee, including evidence relating back four years prior to retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1023-24. That is, the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Terban</span> decided the case having the totality of the evidence at hand, which allowed for consideration of all of the activity leading to the employee's retirement and provided context for an analysis of the events temporally close to the employee's retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case at issue, the administrative judge failed to consider the events occurring on the Tongass prior to Shoaf's transfer to the timber staff in September 1993. While it is within the MSPB's discretion to give proper evidentiary weight to events occurring from April 1990 through September 1993 and to the events following Shoaf's transfer to the timber unit, the MSPB abused its discretion by completely failing to consider the pre-transfer activities concerning Shoaf on the Tongass. That is, events occurring from the time period commencing on the date of Shoaf's transfer to the Tongass in April 1990, including actions and inactions by his supervisors during the relevant time period and his transfer to the timber unit, must be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances in determining whether Shoaf's resignation was involuntary. The level of evidentiary weight the MSPB must grant to events temporally further from Shoaf's resignation than the agency's post-transfer conduct is within its discretion; yet, such events must, at a minimum, be considered to place activity and inactivity more immediately preceding Shoaf's retirement into the proper context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding Shoaf's resignation, we vacate and remand this case for a decision comporting with the precepts delineated herein.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the Board reaffirmed its decision that Shoaf was not forced to resign, <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. USDA</span>, 97 MSPR 68, 76-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-19 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A decision to resign is presumed to be voluntary, and an employee who voluntarily resigns has no right of appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1340-41. The court in this case held that the Board, however, "possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1341 ("If it is established that a resignation or retirement is involuntary, the MSPB not only has jurisdiction, 'but also the employee wins on the merits and is entitled to reinstatement.'"). An objective standard is used to determine whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign, considering the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ set forth several factors on remand that led him to find that the events transpiring between April 1990 and September 1993 did not offer significant support for the appellant's claim that his 1995 resignation was involuntary, including: (1) The fact that the appellant's discussion of his resignation focused on his claim of deliberate idling while assigned to the Timber Staff, rather than his earlier experiences on the Planning Staff, which he treated as separate matters in his closing argument; (2) the passage of nineteen months between the resignation and the most recent instance of alleged harassment on the Planning Staff (non-attendance at the forestry conference), with periods ranging from twenty-two months to thirty-six months between the resignation and the alleged actions that the appellant believed threatened to end or diminish his role as an IDT Leader, which significantly lessened the possibility that the actions deprived the appellant of freedom of choice when he resigned; (3) the change in the appellant's work assignment at the time of his resignation, including his assignment to a different organization, with different duties, a different supervisor, and reduced contacts with the individuals he had charged with reprisal; and (4) the fact that none of the alleged reprisal during the Planning Staff period posed a continuing threat to the appellant when he resigned because his IDT activities had come to an end. The AJ found that, even in the absence of the above factors, the alleged acts of reprisal that occurred before the appellant's reassignment to the Timber Staff did not uniformly support the appellant's feeling of unfair treatment and were not sufficiently egregious that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's reassignment from the Planning Staff to the Timber Staff, the AJ found that the agency did not act improperly in deciding to reduce the number of employees assigned to planning work and to include the appellant among the employees assigned to other work. The AJ noted that the appellant did not challenge the agency's decision to shift planning work to private contractors, decided for himself that he would not be among those who continued to work on the Planning Staff because he did not want to work for his Planning Staff supervisor, did not contend that the reassignment was retaliatory, and was selected for assignment to the Timber Staff because it removed him from the Planning Staff supervisor. The AJ therefore found that there was no basis to view the transfer itself as a coercive act by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's working conditions while assigned to the Timber Staff, the AJ adopted his prior analysis of the appellant's claim of deliberate idling, finding that the appellant's working conditions on the Timber Staff were not so intolerable that a reasonable person would have been forced to resign. In this regard, the AJ noted that he had previously found that: (1) Gene Eide, the appellant's supervisor on the Timber Staff, was not charged with reprisal and there was no basis for a finding that he was less than an unbiased and conscientious supervisor; (2) David Rittenhouse, the appellant's second-level supervisor whom the appellant felt was motivated by reprisal, was not shown actually to have influenced adversely the appellant's opportunities for meaningful work on the Timber Staff; (3) none of the four instances where the appellant claimed work had been withheld actually constituted deliberate idling by management; (4) the appellant made little effort to find additional work and did not respond with substantive suggestions when management sought to address his complaints about inactivity; (5) the appellant's emphasis in the period shortly before the resignation was on settlement of his whistleblowing complaint rather than on securing work assignments; (6) before the resignation application, significant work had become available in the development of a new mapping program using airborne video; (7) the appellant's apparent disdain for the airborne video project was not warranted; and (8) the AJ did not need to reach the question of the extent to which the appellant's acceptance of a monetary separation incentive weighed against a finding of involuntariness. The AJ found on remand that "[o]ne of the most definite subjective impressions which I received from my observations of the witnesses at the hearing was that Mr. Eide showed good faith regarding his responsibilities as the appellant's supervisor." The Board must give deference, as it does here, to an AJ's credibility determinations that are explicitly or implicitly based on observations of the demeanor of a testifying witness. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). "Deliberate idling" connotes knowing or intentional conduct, <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> <span class="Italic">v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 802 F.2d 537, 544 (D.C. Cir. 1986), and the AJ found no knowing or intentional conduct by the agency in this case. In fact, the appellant acknowledged in an e-mail to Eide that, although he was not being fully utilized, "[p]art of this is due to TM's [Timber Management's] being over-staffed and there simply not being enough work to go around. We thought the buyout might change that, but apparently that won't happen."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's argument that the AJ did not consider the "actions and inactions" predating the appellant's September 1993 transfer to the Timber Staff, we find that the AJ considered those events, but simply found they did not offer significant support for the appellant's claim that he resigned involuntarily in 1995. The AJ's findings allowed for consideration of all of the activity leading to the appellant's resignation and provided a context for his analysis of the events temporally close to the appellant's resignation. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1342. As the court held, it is within the Board's discretion to give proper evidentiary weight to events occurring from April 1990 through September 1993 and to the events following Shoaf's transfer to the timber unit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant asserts that the AJ did not mention or consider the appellant's disclosures, an AJ's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). In any event, <span id="Page_2019"></span>the AJ implicitly considered the appellant's disclosures in finding that Eide was not motivated by reprisal for whistleblowing, but instead was an unbiased and conscientious supervisor. Although the AJ found that, "even in the absence of the factors discussed above, the alleged acts of reprisal which occurred before the appellant's reassignment to the Timber Staff would not have caused a reasonable employee to resign," this alternative finding, when read in context, does not indicate that the AJ considered those events in isolation; rather, the AJ correctly ultimately held that, "[u]nder the totality of the circumstances reviewed above," the appellant did not prove by preponderant evidence that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. The appellant has not challenged the AJ's finding on remand that the appellant's request for corrective action regarding other alleged personnel actions was moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we have considered the appellant's arguments on review relating to the merits of the AJ's decision and find that they do not meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d). We also discern no error in the AJ's ultimate determination that the appellant did not meet his burden of proving by preponderant evidence that his resignation was involuntary because he did not prove that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign, effective March 31, 1995, under the totality of the circumstances in this appeal. Because the court in this case emphasized that the Board possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned only if the employee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her resignation was involuntary and thus tantamount to a forced removal, <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341, it appears that the court intended for the Board on remand to ascertain its jurisdiction under that standard, rather than the jurisdictional standard for individual right of action (IRA) appeals under <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We therefore find that, while the appellant would not be entitled to relief under either standard, <span class="Italic">see Schaeffer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 606 &#x00B6; 20 (2000) (whether raised in an IRA appeal or in a direct appeal to the Board, a resignation is actionable only if the appellant shows that it was involuntary), the proper disposition of this appeal is dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 552 (1993) (under the law of the case doctrine the Board is bound to honor the decisions of the Federal Circuit). Accordingly, the initial decision is affirmed as modified by this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board was affirmed on review, <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. USDA,</span> 158 Fed. Appx. 267 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP). <span class="Italic">See Conley v. DOD</span>, SF-1221-15-0580-W-1 (NP 5/2/2022) (crediting AJ's analysis: "she found that the appellant retired in large part because he felt that if he did not retire, the agency would eventually remove him on what he considered meritless charges. Nonetheless, she found that the following facts weighed heavily against a fi nding of coercion: (1) the appellant took a month of leave in December 2012, just prior to his retirement; (2) he had accepted a position outside of the agency, which began on April 1, 2013; and (3) he was not facing any proposed or pending adverse action at the time he made his decision to retire.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegedly severe harassment resulting from whistleblowing, established an adequate jurisdictional basis for a Board appeal from an involuntary retirement, <span class="Italic">Coufal v. DOJ</span>, 98 MSPR 31, 40-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-29 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The touchstone of the "voluntariness" analysis and the common element in all Board cases involving alleged involuntary resignations or retirements "is that factors have operated on the employee's decision-making processes that deprived him or her of freedom of choice." <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 513, 519 (1995). The totality of the circumstances is examined by an objective standard to determine voluntariness, not the employee's purely subjective evaluation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 520. Under that objective standard, the Board will find a retirement or resignation involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that "under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an alleged involuntary retirement if she makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Frison v. Department of the Army</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 431 &#x00B6; 4 (2003). A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Locke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 283, 288 (1994). Thus, to establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant need not allege facts that, if proven, definitely would establish that the retirement was involuntary; she need only allege facts that, if proven, could establish such a claim. <span class="Italic">Frison</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 431 &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">McCray v. Department of the Navy</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 154 &#x00B6; 11 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, where allegations of discrimination and reprisal for whistleblowing activity are alleged in connection with a determination of voluntariness, such evidence may only be addressed insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Pickens v. Social Security Administration</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 525 &#x00B6; 6 (2001). Thus, evidence of discrimination and reprisal goes to the ultimate question of coercion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to raise nonfrivolous allegations that her retirement was involuntary. In so finding, the administrative judge characterized the appellant's claims of intolerable working conditions as "general" and stated that "[t]he appellant's bare assertions of legal conclusions, such as a generalized claim that she was subjected to harassment, do not rise to the level of nonfrivolous allegations of facts which, if proven, could establish Board jurisdiction." The administrative judge further stated that the appellant did not "allege[ ] facts which would make any reasonable person feel compelled to retire" because "[r]easonable people do not feel compelled to resign or retire over the type of unpleasantness...identified by the appellant, even if they are embarrassing or demeaning." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's submissions below show that she raised nonfrivolous allegations that her retirement was involuntary, entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Frison</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 431 &#x00B6; 4. The appellant argued below, and reasserts in her petition for review, that the Warden harassed and retaliated against her, creating a hostile work environment from the time she made alleged protected disclosures in October 2000, until she was forced to take sick leave on January 26, 2001, and ultimately to retire effective November 3, 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following examples of the appellant's claims that support our finding of a nonfrivolous allegation of a constructive discharge are not intended as a complete summary of all the evidence of record on this matter. In her appeal, the appellant asserted that the Warden took the following actions in reprisal for her alleged protected disclosures: (1) On October 11, 2000, she eliminated the appellant's key duties, including removing the Financial Management Department from her line of supervision; (2) on November 25, 2000, she changed the appellant's working conditions by requiring her to work, without compensation, every weekend and every holiday; (3) on December 13, 2000, after 25 years of "outstanding" and "exceeds" performance ratings, she issued her a performance improvement plan (PIP), which stated that her job performance was at "an unacceptable level" and threatened to remove, demote, or reassign her; (4) as part of the PIP, she required the appellant to meet with her 3 days per week and to "walk" with her 2 days per week for observation; (5) she isolated the appellant physically and socially from other department heads; (6) she excluded her from meetings, allegedly "crippling her ability to do her job"; (7) she made negative remarks about the appellant to other department heads; (8) she solicited negative letters about the appellant from other department heads; and (9) in January 2001, she stated to the appellant and to the appellant's colleagues that she wanted the appellant to retire. <span class="Italic">[S]ee, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 139 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant contended that, as a result of the Warden's conduct, she suffered from (and was diagnosed with) severe depression. In support of this claim, the appellant submitted a copy of a July 10, 2001 medical report from her treating psychiatrist, Brenda Hines, M.D., reflecting that in January 2001 the appellant sought medical assistance at an Emergency Clinic and, at that time, was found to be acutely suicidal with "severe major depression." Dr. Hines reported that an initial psychiatric evaluation, conducted in January 2001, revealed that the appellant was passively suicidal and was "so severely depressed" that it affected her cognition and resulted in impairments in memory, attention, concentration, and ability to make decisions. The medical report further indicated that the appellant was diagnosed with Meniere's disease, "a unilateral perceptive hearing loss with fluctuations, progression, and frequency of attacks being correlated with increased stress or emotional disturbances." According to Dr. Hines, the appellant's conditions "have been correlated with the work stress." She further opined that, should the appellant be placed at her previous level of functioning under the Warden's supervision, she likely would "have a relapse despite maintenance therapy." Finally, the appellant claimed that her mental incapacitation, which was caused by the Warden's harassment, coupled with the agency's failure to reassign her to another agency facility and her doctor's orders not to return to work under the supervision of the Warden, gave her no choice but to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, we find that the totality of the circumstances supports a finding that the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations that her retirement was involuntary, thereby entitling her to a hearing on the issue of adverse action jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Frison</span>, 94 MSPR 431 &#x00B6; 4.</p>
