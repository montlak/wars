<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-289"><span class="space">c.</span> Amendment of Complaint; Matters Fully and Fairly Litigated</h5>
<p class="noindent">5 CFR 2423.20(c) (2022) allows a complaint to be amended by the regional director at any time before the answer is filed, or later by motion to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The judge has discretion to grant or deny a union motion to amend a complaint. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 247</span>, 44 FLRA 1306, 1307 n.2 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 55 FLRA 951, 954 (1999) (regulations permit amendment any time before complaint being transmitted to FLRA, including hearing; judge's ruling on amendment is reviewed under abuse of authority standard). <span class="Italic">VAMC Hampton and AFGE Local 2328</span>, 51 FLRA 84, 87 (1995), stated that "[w]here a party excepts to the judge's ruling on the motion, the Authority applies an abuse of discretion standard in resolving the exception." It was appropriate for the General Counsel to amend its complaint eight days before a hearing to correct the identification of employees involved in respondent's alleged unfair labor practice. The substantive allegations were unchanged. Respondent <span id="page_1571"></span>made no showing that it was impaired or prejudiced in presenting its defense or that due process was violated by the amendment. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 4 FLRA 237, 246 (1980) (ALJ Decision). If a party is to make a credible claim of prejudice resulting from a motion to amend the complaint in a ULP case at the hearing, the objecting party should seek a postponement to secure witnesses if the basis for the prejudice is a need to secure rebuttal witnesses. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU</span>, 15 FLRA 309, 309 n.1 (1984). Should the ALJ decline to permit the General Counsel to amend the complaint at the conclusion of the hearing, FLRA will not find error if there is no showing of an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., Frenchburg Job Corps, Mariba and NFFE Local 466</span>, 46 FLRA 1375, 1376 n.1 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council Local 2544</span>, 58 FLRA 656, 658-59 (2003), declined to set aside a ULP finding based on arguably technical deficiencies in service of a charge and amendment of the charge and a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The alleged deficiencies in the issuance of the complaint against Respondent Region do not provide a basis for dismissing the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents allege that the complaint was issued in a manner that violated three Regulations, specifically, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; &#x00A7; 2423.9, 2423.6(d) and 2423.8(a).[5] In order for procedural irregularities to provide a basis for dismissing a complaint, a respondent must show that it was prejudiced by those irregularities<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of the Army, Harry Diamond Labs., Adelphi, Md.</span>, 9 FLRA 575, 575 n.1 (1982)<span class="Italic">. See also United States Penitentiary, Florence, Colo.</span>, 53 FLRA 1393, 1394, 1403 (1998) (adopting judge's decision); <span class="Italic">United States DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp, Montgomery, Pa.</span>, 40 FLRA 449, 455 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">United States DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d 1267 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We find it unnecessary to address whether the GC complied with the cited provisions of the ULP Manual because, even assuming that the GC did not comply, the Manual does not create enforceable rights<span class="Italic">. See </span>ULP Manual, Foreward (the Manual constitutes only "<span class="Italic">guidance </span>to Regional Agents" of the Authority) (emphasis added)<span class="Italic">. Cf. Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Dallas, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 1239, 1241 (2000) (GC's Representation Manual "does not create enforceable procedural rights beyond the rights set out in the regulations.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents argue that the complaint was not issued in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.9, which provides that a charging party may amend the charge "[p]rior to the issuance of a complaint." The Judge determined that the charge was amended prior to the issuance of the complaint, as evidenced by the fact that the complaint "expressly refer[s] to the charge having already been amended." As the Respondents provide no basis for finding that determination erroneous, we reject the Respondents' argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We find no support in &#x00A7; 2423.9 for construing that Regulation's requirement that the charge be amended "prior" to issuance of the complaint as forbidding amendment prior to, but on the same day as, issuance of the complaint. In addition, we note that as a practical matter, a charging party's right to unilaterally amend a charge must end with the issuance of the complaint because, after the issuance of the complaint, any change in the allegations against the respondent would require amendment of the complaint, not the charge. Amendments to the complaint are governed by &#x00A7; 2423.20 of the Regulations, and are the responsibility of the GC, not the charging party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents also argue that the complaint was not issued in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.6(d) because Respondent Region was not served with a charge "prior to the issuance of the Complaint." Section 2423.6(d) provides, in pertinent part, that the charging party "shall serve a copy of the charge" on the charged party, and that the Authority's Regional Office investigating the charge also "routinely serves a copy of the charge on the Charged Party[.]" Nothing in &#x00A7; 2423.6(d) requires that the charge be served prior to the complaint. Accordingly, we reject the Respondents' argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.8(a), that Regulation provides that "[d]uring the course of the investigation [of the charge], all parties involved are afforded an opportunity to present their evidence and views to the Regional Director." It is undisputed that Respondent Region did not have the opportunity to respond to the amended charge prior to issuance of the complaint. Thus, the Respondents have established that the GC did not follow the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.8(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents do not explain how Respondent Region was prejudiced by the GC's failure to give Respondent Region an opportunity to respond prior to issuance of the complaint naming Respondent Region. Although Respondent Region was deprived of the opportunity to present evidence to the FLRA prior to being named in the amended charge, this in no way establishes that it was prejudiced by the fact that it fully presented its position after the issuance of the complaint, rather than before. In this connection, the Respondents do not assert that there is evidence or any other matter that Respondent Region would have introduced during the pre-complaint investigation that would have affected the course of the case. Thus, while we do not condone the GC's failure to follow the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.8(a), we find that Respondent Region was not prejudiced by that procedural irregularity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Judge did not abuse his discretion by permitting amendment of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will reverse a judge's ruling on a motion to amend a complaint only where the judge abused his or her discretion<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of Transp., FAA, Fort Worth, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 951, 954 (1999). In resolving this issue, the Authority assesses whether the respondent had sufficient notice regarding the issue sought to be included in the complaint by the amendment, or whether the respondent was prejudiced by the amendment to the complaint<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The original complaint alleged that Respondent Region failed to furnish items 6 and 9, among other items. Consequently, the complaint put Respondent Region on notice that it would need to defend against its failure to furnish items 6 and 9. The amendment to the complaint, which was requested thirteen days before the hearing, narrowed the allegations to state that Respondent Region failed to furnish only items 6 and 9 and to add a responsible official, Pyeatt, from Respondent Region. As the Respondents were able to call Pyeatt as a witness and fully question him, and do not in any way explain how they were prejudiced by the amendment narrowing the allegation against it, they have not demonstrated that the Judge abused his discretion by permitting that amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent">A regional director may amend a complaint under &#x00A7; 2423.20(c) of the regulations. If the regional director is served with a motion to dismiss the complaint before it is referred to an ALJ, however, FLRA apparently desires the director to rule on the motion rather than amend the complaint to cure the defect, e.g., the possibility that lacking the amendment the complaint will be barred by the six-month limitation period. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey Conservation Div. and AFGE Local 3457</span>, 9 FLRA 543, 544 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">The ALJ assigned to a ULP case should not amend a complaint on his own initiative. Amendment is at the initiative of FLRA's General Counsel, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Florence and AFGE Local 1300</span>, 59 FLRA 165, 170-71 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a motion to amend is proper, the Authority assesses whether the respondent had sufficient notice regarding the issue sought to be included in the complaint by the amendment<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Dep't of Transp., FAA, Ft. Worth, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 951, 954 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>) and cases cited therein. The Authority will reverse a judge's ruling on a motion to amend a complaint only where the judge abused his or her discretion<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In our view, the Judge erred in allowing the complaint to be amended and in finding a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4) of the Statute because the Respondent did not have notice of, or a fair opportunity to present a defense to, this allegation, and because the Judge abused his discretion by suggesting at the hearing that the complaint be amended to include this violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(4) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice "to discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint, affidavit, or petition, or has given any information or testimony under this chapter[.]" Neither the complaint nor the amended complaint included an allegation that &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4) had been violated. Moreover, this allegation was not fully and fairly litigated<span class="Italic">. See Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C. &#x0026; Phoenix, Ariz. &#x0026; Fed. Corr. Inst., El Reno, Okla.</span>, 52 FLRA 421, 429 (1996) (<span class="Italic">BOP</span>); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 467 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record testimony set forth above demonstrates that the &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4) allegation was generated entirely by the Judge. The Judge's amendment of the complaint to include the &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4) allegation was based on the filing of the unfair labor practice charge by the Union representative. The other allegations of the complaint were based solely on the posting and distribution of the flyer. As such, the Respondent did not "kn[o]w what conduct was at issue" and did not have "a fair opportunity to present a defense." <span class="Italic">BOP</span>, 52 FLRA at 429. Consequently, the Judge erred in finding that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we also find that the Judge abused his discretion by suggesting, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, that the complaint be amended to include this new allegation. It is the responsibility of the General Counsel, not an administrative law judge, to determine whether to amend an unfair labor practice complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">A motion to amend a complaint will be entertained at a hearing to conform pleadings to proof. But the motion will not be granted if the opposing party is taken by surprise or put to great disadvantage or undue difficulty. <span class="Italic">FMCS and NAGE Local R3-118</span>, 9 FLRA 199, 208 n.10 (1982) (ALJ Decision).

<p class="noindent">An issue was not properly before FLRA when there was no attempt to amend the complaint at the hearing, apparently irrespective of the fact that the <span id="page_1572"></span>issue was factually developed at the hearing and briefed. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress and CREA</span>, 15 FLRA 589, 591 (1984). But there is no error if the ALJ considers matters not covered in the complaint if the matters were fully litigated by all parties at the hearing. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 56, 56 n.1 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons USP McCreary and AFGE Local 614</span>, 71 FLRA 538, 540-41 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring) (fairness requires notice of issues in a ULP complaint; GC's complaint provided adequate notice of an issue; the issue was fully and fairly litigated); <span class="Italic">Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 55 FLRA 116, 121 (1999) (issue is "fully and fairly litigated" when issue was developed through direct and cross-examination, even if issue was not specifically referenced in General Counsel's complaint and opening statement). If the body of the complaint alleges facts that would constitute a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) and reference at the hearing is made to an (a)(2) violation without objection by respondent, it may serve the ends of justice to treat the complaint as if it had been amended to charge that violation if it were necessary to do so to remedy the conduct alleged as a ULP. <span class="Italic">Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 6 FLRA 159, 169 (1981) (ALJ Decision).</p>

(quoting <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Coca Cola Bottling Company of Buffalo, Inc.</span>, 811 F.2d 82, 87 (2d Cir. 1987)).

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Counsel for the General Counsel stated in his opening statement that the supervisor's "failure to recommend...Shackleford for a step incentive award was in reprisal for a protected activity in seeking representation" from the Union. He also stated that, as part of the remedy, the supervisor should be directed to recommend the employee "retroactively for a step incentive award...." These statements may reasonably be interpreted as putting the Respondent on notice of this argument by the General Counsel. Counsel for the Respondent responded, in her opening statement, that the reason the supervisor did not recommend Shackleford for an incentive award "was not because of Ms. Shackleford's Union involvement but because Ms. Shackleford failed to provide training...to sufficient operating room staff." Respondent's Counsel also attempted to establish, through the supervisor's testimony, that the supervisor did not recommend Shackleford for the incentive award because she had not provided sufficient staff training, rather than as a result of Shackleford's seeking Union assistance. In these circumstances, we find that the Respondent had notice and fully litigated the issue concerning whether the supervisor's failure to recommend Shackleford for an incentive award violated section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The concept of implicit amendments to complaints through litigation was reiterated and its application denied in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 52 FLRA 421, 428-32 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The charge in this case, which was amended several months prior to issuance of the complaint, alleges only that "during the course of the interrogation, [the investigator] continually refused the employee the opportunity to confer in private with his representative in order to gain a better understanding of the questions he was being ordered to answer."...&#8197;[T]he relevant section of the complaint alleges that "[t]he Respondents denied active representation by the union representative, including the right to confer privately, during the examination." The Respondents present no reason why the phrase "including the right to confer privately" must be construed as limiting the manner in which the investigator allegedly denied active Union representation during the examination, rather than merely illustrating one way in which he did so, and no reason for such a construction is apparent. At the same time, it is undisputed that the complaint does not expressly state the allegation that the General Counsel now seeks to pursue--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the Union representative was prevented from clarifying questions. Thus, the complaint is ambiguous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a complaint is silent or ambiguous about specific issues that are later raised at the hearing, the Authority may still consider and dispose of those issues if the record shows that they were fully and fairly litigated. Thus, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 467 (1995), the Authority affirmed that, consistent with private sector precedent, a violation not expressly alleged in a complaint may be found if all issues surrounding the violation have been litigated fully and fairly. The Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span> that the test of full and fair litigation was one of whether the respondent knew what conduct was at issue and had a fair opportunity to present a defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also, e.g., U.S. Department of the Air Force, 56th Support</span> <span class="Italic">Group, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida</span>, 51 FLRA 1144, 1157 (1996); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Border Patrol, Washington, D.C.</span>, 41 FLRA 154, 173 (1991); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 35 FLRA 491, 494 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority expressly applied these principles in <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 896 (1996). The complaint in that case alleged that an employee did not <span class="Italic">receive</span> an incentive award promised to her by her supervisor, but did not clearly allege that the supervisor had failed to <span class="Italic">recommend</span> the employee for the award. Nevertheless, counsel for the General Counsel's opening statement at the hearing alleged that the supervisor had failed to recommend the award for the employee in reprisal for her protected activities. The respondent expressly contested this allegation in its own opening statement and introduced testimony from the supervisor in an attempt to rebut it. In these circumstances, the Authority determined that the respondent had sufficient notice of the allegation and was able to fully litigate it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although counsel for the General Counsel's opening statement in this case makes a clear reference to the investigator's alleged refusal to permit the Union representative to clarify questions, neither the testimony nor other record evidence describes any specific instance when this refusal occurred, identifies any of the questions which the Union representative was not permitted to clarify, or otherwise illuminates this general allegation. For example, it is not clear from the Union representative's testimony whether he was attempting to ask questions of the investigator or offering clarification of his own. None of the testimony on this point was developed, and counsel for the General Counsel made no further reference to it during the course of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, unlike <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>, where the record showed that the respondent expressly acknowledged and defended itself against a new allegation at the hearing, no response to the disputed allegation in this case was made until the Respondents filed their opposition to the General Counsel's exceptions. Indeed, the Respondents specifically claim that they did not protest the introduction of this allegation in counsel for the General Counsel's opening statement because they did not believe the allegation was part of the case. We attach no particular weight to the Respondents' claim, since it is impossible to verify, and we certainly do not base our decision on it. We note only that the record in this case--unlike the record in <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>--contains no independent evidence from which we can conclude that the Respondents understood, or clearly should have understood, that a new allegation had been raised against them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel relies on <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, 416 CSG, Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, New York</span>, 38 FLRA 1136 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Griffiss</span>) to assert that the disputed allegation in this case can be encompassed by the complaint. This reliance is misplaced, however, because the Authority expressly found in <span class="Italic">Griffiss</span> that issues relating to events not alleged in the complaint "were fully litigated at the hearing<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1146.[12]...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The General Counsel also cites <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 35 FLRA 491 (1990), and <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service, Washington, D.C</span>. <span class="Italic">and U.S. Customs Service, Northeast Region (Boston</span>, <span class="Italic">Massachusetts</span>), 29 FLRA 891 (1987) for the proposition that a mere ambiguity in the complaint does not preclude litigation of an issue where both parties understand that issue and present evidence relating to it. This proposition is not in dispute. What is in dispute is whether the Respondents in this case understood the nature of the allegations and had a proper opportunity to defend against them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[D]ue process considerations are basic in American jurisprudence...." <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, 51 FLRA at 467. When a complaint is ambiguous and the record does not clearly show that the respondent otherwise understood (or should have understood) what was in dispute, fairness requires that any doubts about due process be resolved in favor of the respondent. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2501, Memphis, Tennessee</span>, 51 FLRA 1657, 1660-64 (1996) (Authority reversed judge's finding that union president violated the Statute by making certain statements, even though union did not except to judge's finding on this ground, because record did not demonstrate that union was or should have been on notice that statements were alleged as violation). We again stress that it is the record evidence, not merely the contentions of the parties, upon which our decision must be based. Although counsel for the General Counsel's opening statement <span class="Italic">might</span> have been sufficient in other circumstances to put a previously unstated allegation in issue, the preponderance of the evidence in this case does not show that it was.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel's exception points out clearly the difficulties that result when a complaint is ambiguous and the question whether a factual issue was fully and fairly litigated is presented on appeal. On balance, <span id="page_1573"></span>however, in view of the undeveloped record, and guided by the principle that doubts on this issue must be resolved in favor of the respondent, we are unable to conclude that the Respondents had sufficient notice of the allegation that the Union representative was prevented from obtaining clarification of the questions asked of the employee, and thus did not have an opportunity to fully and fairly defend against this allegation. Consequently, we conclude that this allegation was not properly before the Judge, and that he did not err by failing to rule on it.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determined that an issue was not properly raised by the pleadings and not fairly litigated in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., S. Cent. Reg. and NTEU Chap. 168</span>, 53 FLRA 789, 795-97 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleges that the Respondent refused to furnish the requested information for a 4-year period. The Judge found that the Respondent had no obligation to furnish 4 years' worth of information, but that it violated the Statute by failing and refusing to furnish the requested information for a 1-year period. The Respondent's exception raises the question whether the Respondent was afforded adequate due process and an opportunity to defend itself against the violation found by the Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Due process requires that a respondent have a meaningful opportunity to litigate the underlying issue, and, as a general rule, the Authority will not review allegations that are not included in the complaint. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2501, Memphis, Tennessee</span>, 51 FLRA 1657, 1660-61 (1996), citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 467 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Labor</span>). "An exception to this rule may arise when allegations not included in the complaint are nonetheless properly litigated by the parties<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. "Where a complaint is silent or ambiguous about specific issues that are later raised at the hearing, [the Authority] may still consider and dispose of those issues if the record shows that they were fully and fairly litigated<span class="Italic">."

"By fully and fairly litigated, we mean that all parties understood (or objectively should have understood) the issues in dispute and had a reasonable opportunity to present relevant evidence<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1661 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the charge nor the complaint in this case alleges that the Respondent violated the Statute by failing and refusing to furnish information for a 1-year period. Moreover...undisputed testimony at the hearing made it clear that the Union was not willing to narrow or modify its request and that the Union wanted the information exactly as it was requested. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that all parties understood, or objectively should have understood, that the issue in dispute concerned the furnishing of information for a 4-year period, not a 1-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is similar to <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>. In that case, the Authority found that the judge erred by finding that the respondent violated the Statute by failing to provide the union with sanitized information, when the record showed that, throughout the proceeding, the union sought only unsanitized information. The Authority concluded that the respondent "was not afforded notice and an opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the issue of whether sanitized information should have been furnished the [u]nion." <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, 51 FLRA at 468. In this case, the Judge found that the Respondent failed to provide the Union with information for a 1-year period, when the only alleged violation was that the Respondent failed to provide the Union with the requested information for a 4-year period, and the record establishes that the Union was not willing to modify its request. The record supports the conclusion that the issue of whether the Respondent failed to provide the Union with information for a 1-year period was not fully and fairly litigated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">National Park Service, National Capitol Region</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Park Police</span>, 48 FLRA 1151 (1993) (<span class="Italic">National Park</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>) is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, the union requested documents concerning two distinct types of information: disciplinary recommendations and sick leave recommendations. The Authority found that the union was entitled to the former but not the latter. There was no question in that case that the respondent had the opportunity to litigate whether it was obligated to provide each category of documents. Inasmuch as the respondent had the opportunity to litigate the issue of its obligation to provide each category of documents, the Authority properly found that the respondent committed an unfair labor practice and ordered it to provide only one of the categories of documents requested in <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, as discussed above, the Respondent in the instant case did not have the opportunity to litigate the issue of whether it failed to provide the Union with information covering a period of time briefer than the period the documents were requested to cover. Indeed, the Respondent has stated that it might well have conveyed to the Union documents covering a shorter period of time. Here, where the issue of the Respondent's obligation to provide documents for a shorter period of time than requested was not litigated, there is no basis to find that the Respondent committed an unfair labor practice and order it to provide documents covering a 1-year period, when documents covering a 4-year period had been requested.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an issue is raised for the first time in posthearing briefs and the respondent is not clearly on notice of the issue, making it possible that the issue was not fully litigated at the hearing, it is inappropriate to adjudicate the ULP claim presented by that issue. <span class="Italic">Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 3 FLRA 512, 512 (1980). FLRA expanded on that theme, permitting presentation of issues involving due process objections belatedly raised but briefed in exceptions to an ALJ Decision, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2501 and Brown</span>, 51 FLRA 1657, 1660-64 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, it is evident that the complaint in this case does not allege that Boyd's December 12 statement to the grievance committee interfered with employee rights protected by section 7102 of the Statute. Therefore, we begin by considering whether the Union was afforded adequate due process and an opportunity to defend itself against the violation found by the Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have previously observed that "[d]ue process considerations are basic to American jurisprudence." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 467 (1995). An essential element of due process, and one imposed by law on administrative agencies such as the Authority, is the responsibility of ensuring that every respondent in an unfair labor practice proceeding is adequately notified of the "matters of fact and law asserted." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 554(b)(3). What constitutes adequate notice will depend on the circumstances of each case. In every instance, however, this notice must afford the respondent "a meaningful opportunity to litigate the underlying issue." <span class="Italic">Road Sprinkler Fitters Local</span> <span class="Italic">Union No. 669 v. NLRB</span>, 778 F.2d 8, 16 (D.C. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, we will not review allegations that are not included in the complaint. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Frenchburg Job Corps</span>, <span class="Italic">Mariba, Kentucky</span>, 46 FLRA 1375, 1384 (1993). An exception to this rule may arise when allegations not included in the complaint are nonetheless properly litigated by the parties. Thus, although the purpose of a complaint is to put a respondent on notice of the basis of the charges against it, we do not judge the sufficiency of that notice by rigid pleading requirements. Where a complaint is silent or ambiguous about specific issues that are later raised at the hearing, we may still consider and dispose of those issues if the record shows that they were fully and fairly litigated<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., U.S. Department of the Air Force, 56th Support</span> <span class="Italic">Group, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida</span>, 51 FLRA 1144, 1157 (1996); <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 896, 900 (1996); <span class="Italic">OLAM Southwest Air Defense Sector (TAC), Point Arena Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Station, Point Arena, California</span>, 51 FLRA 797, 807-08 (1996). By "fully and fairly litigated," we mean that all parties understood (or objectively should have understood) the issues in dispute and had a reasonable opportunity to present relevant evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Border Patrol, Washington, D.C.</span>, 41 FLRA 154, 173 (1991). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, 51 FLRA at 467-68 (discussing and adopting private sector due process considerations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the charge nor the complaint in this case refers to Boyd's December 12 statement to the grievance committee. As a result, neither the charge nor the complaint would reasonably have put the Union on notice that Boyd's statement, or its effect on employee rights protected by section 7102, was to have been litigated at the hearing. The Union's only witness at the hearing was Boyd, who denied making the December 12 statement and whose testimony on that point the Judge chose not to credit. It is impossible to ascertain whether the Union might have proffered additional testimony from other employees who attended the December 12 meeting had it known that Boyd's statement at that meeting, rather than the January 1993 statement to Brown alleged in the complaint, was to become a dispositive issue in this case. To the extent that the Union was prevented by its lack of notice from introducing such testimony, or even from deciding whether to seek such testimony in evaluating its position, it is difficult to conclude that it entered the hearing fully prepared to defend itself.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;We note that the National Labor Relations Board has found the argument that a respondent was denied an opportunity to conform its defense to what was actually litigated persuasive as a reason to find a denial of due process. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Castaways Hotel and Casino</span>, 284 NLRB 612, 614 (1987); <span class="Italic">Maintenance Service Corporation</span>, 275 NLRB 1422, 1426 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union could not clearly have known until after the hearing, when it received the General Counsel's posthearing brief, that the legal theory of the case against it had grown from allegations that it failed to meet its section 7114(a)(1) duty of fair representation to include an allegation that it also independently interfered with employee rights under section 7102.[5] Under section 2423.25 of the Authority's Regulations, posthearing briefs are not mandatory in unfair labor practice proceedings. To consider a legal theory offered only in a posthearing document that is optional in the first place does not ensure fairness <span id="page_1574"></span>at the hearing. The fact that AFGE was able to argue against this legal theory in its exceptions to the Authority is of little consequence when that argument was limited to a record that closed before the theory was ever announced.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The first explicit reference to section 7102 in this case appears in the General Counsel's posthearing brief to the Judge, which asserts that "[t]he Union, by creating the impression that it would deny Brown representation if he refused to pay the expense of that representation, interfered with, restrained, and coerced Brown in the exercise of his protected rights under &#x00A7; 7102 and violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1)." At no point during the hearing did counsel for the General Counsel state that section 7102 was to play any part in the legal theory of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE does not contend on exception that the Union was prejudiced at the hearing or that AFGE itself is in any way prejudiced now in its ability to defend the Union before the Authority.&#x2003;Therefore, we consider whether a party waives its rights to due process by its failure to take exception to a denial of those rights, or whether the Authority itself should act, even in the absence of exceptions, if it appears that such rights have been abridged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a respondent in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) unfair labor practice proceeding is not precluded from raising before the court, and prevailing upon, due process arguments that it did not raise before the NLRB. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Blake Construction</span> <span class="Italic">Co., Inc.</span>, 663 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">Blake</span>). The court arrived at this holding even though section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act provides that "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board...shall be considered by the [reviewing] court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 160(e).[6] The court in <span class="Italic">Blake</span> summarized its conclusion that section 10(e) did not preclude review by stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]t goes against the grain to uphold a finding of a violation not charged in the complaint, never acknowledged in the hearing, and objected to in some detail before the Board simply because the magic phrase "due process" was not used in the objection. We do not think section 10(e) requires such a triumph of technical pleading over fundamental fairness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 284.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In virtually identical wording, section 7123(c) of the Statute provides that "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are persuaded that if a reviewing court can consider, and uphold, due process objections not urged before the administrative agency whose decision the court is reviewing, then the agency itself can also consider questions of due process even though they may not have been expressly argued before it. Although, in the words of the court in <span class="Italic">Blake</span>, AFGE has not used "the magic phrase 'due process,'" in its exceptions here, it has clearly objected to the violation found by the Judge--a violation based on a statement and a legal theory that were neither alleged in the complaint nor unambiguously acknowledged at the hearing. We therefore conclude that AFGE's failure to expressly object to any denial of due process in its exceptions does not relieve us from considering whether fundamental standards of fairness have been met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching our determination that the complaint in this case must be dismissed, we again emphasize the importance of due process in unfair labor practice proceedings. It is essential to such proceedings that every respondent receive adequate notice of the allegations against it and be given a full and fair opportunity to defend itself at the hearing. The chief purpose of the complaint is to provide this notice.[7] Where a complaint does not adequately notify the respondent of the matters to be litigated, as in this case, we will look to the record of the hearing to determine whether the respondent nevertheless understood, or objectively should have understood, the allegations at issue and had a reasonable opportunity to introduce relevant evidence in its defense. Only when it appears that those allegations have been fully and fairly litigated will we consider them upon review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Section 2423.12(d) [now &#x00A7; 2423.20(c)] of the Authority's Regulations provides for the amendment of a complaint at the hearing. Although a motion for such an amendment will not automatically overcome due process objections, its argument may assist in clarifying the issues in the case as well as in focusing attention on the respondent's opportunity to litigate those issues.</p>
