<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-251"><span class="space">c.</span> Defunct Union</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Related to ineffective elections are the problems of an expiring (or expired) collective bargaining agreement and a union that may lack the authority or ability to prosecute a grievance. In an appeal involving the discharge of an air traffic controller who was alleged to have participated in a labor strike, after the employee filed a grievance challenging his removal, the union was decertified, making it impossible to pursue the case through arbitration. The employee then filed a Board appeal. The appeal was accepted. The employee had no viable option under 5 USC 7121(e)(1) as a result of the decertification, a matter not under the employee's control. The filing of the grievance was not a valid election of remedies. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 25 MSPR 80, 82 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 535, 537-40 (1995), involved Board jurisdiction to entertain a RIF appeal by an employee of a closed military base. While the base was active employees enjoyed the benefits of a negotiated agreement and an active union, but matters apparently changed once the base was closed down and its employees were subjected to a RIF. The Board concluded that grievance rights survived the expiration of the agreement, but the Board could not determine whether the union remained sufficiently intact to prosecute a grievance. If the union could not act on the appellant's behalf, the Board would have jurisdiction over the RIF appeal. The appeal was remanded for additional findings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the appellant is covered by a CBA that does not specifically exclude RIF actions, the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in the CBA are the exclusive procedures for resolving RIF actions that would otherwise be appealable to the Board, except where the RIF action involves discrimination under 5 USC 2302(b)(1)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Morales</span>, 54 MSPR at 229; <span class="Italic">Villante v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 542, 545 (1987). Here, the appellant does not allege that his separation by RIF was tainted by prohibited discrimination under 5 USC 2302(b)(1). Instead, he alleges that he is not covered by a CBA because the CBA ceased to exist the day that his separation by RIF was effected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the appellant's RIF separation occurred prior to or simultaneous with the closing of Fort Ord and Local 2082 and the abolition of the bargaining unit, he has, as a matter of law, an enforceable right to grieve his RIF separation. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) has held that the enforceability of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures continues upon the expiration of a CBA, absent an express agreement by the parties to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force 35th Combat Support Group (TAC) George Air Force Base, California and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 977</span>, 4 FLRA 22, 23 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf. Villante v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 542, 545 (1987) (the terms of a CBA in effect at the time the agency took the action at issue govern). Here, there is no evidence that the parties to the CBA agreed that their negotiated grievance procedure would not survive the closure of Fort Ord and the abolition of the bargaining unit. We find, therefore, that, because the appellant's right to grieve his RIF separation occurred either prior to or simultaneous with the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> expiration of the CBA, he continues to have a right to pursue such a grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then becomes whether there is a labor organization remaining in existence to enforce the appellant's grievance rights under the CBA. The appellant appears to be arguing that there is no labor organization to enforce his grievance rights because Local 2082 is "defunct" due to the closure of Fort Ord and the abolition of the bargaining unit. Under FLRA law,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An exclusive representative is defunct if it is unable or unwilling to represent the employees, and mere temporary inability to function does not constitute defunctness; nor is the loss of all members the equivalent of defunctness if the representative otherwise continues in existence and is willing and able to represent the employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Headquarters, 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing, Massachusetts Air National Guard, Otis Air Force Base and National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-191 and International Association of Firefighters, Local F-196</span>, 1 FLRA 804, 806 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, the CBA here appears to be a local agreement between AFGE Local 2082 and the former Fort Ord. There is no indication that the national union was involved with the CBA in any way, although Local 2082's status as a local chapter of the national union implies a relationship with the national union. Nonetheless, based on the existing record, it is impossible to determine the extent of this relationship, if, indeed, it exists. Further, the CBA is silent as to whether the national union or its district office was to be the successor to the local's obligation to enforce the grievance rights of the bargaining unit members.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a somewhat analogous Board case, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, 25 MSPR 80, 81 (1984), the employee was removed from his position based on charges of misconduct, and he elected to appeal his removal through the applicable negotiated grievance procedure. After he made a binding election, however, and before his grievance could be resolved, the employee's union, PATCO, was decertified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The employee then filed a petition for appeal with the Board. An administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely filed and the employee petitioned for review. The Board granted the petition and found that, notwithstanding the employee's otherwise valid and binding election to pursue a grievance rather than a Board appeal, the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 82. The Board reasoned that the employee's election was not valid because his union's decertification, due to circumstances beyond his control, rendered the act of initially pursuing his rights under the negotiated grievance procedure void <span class="Italic">ab initio</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also found good cause shown for the untimely filing of the appeal and remanded it for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 82-83. In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, therefore, the Board had jurisdiction over the employee's appeal where, due to the decertification of his union, he could not pursue his grievance rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that he is unable to pursue his grievance rights because his local union is defunct due to the closure of Fort Ord. He also appears to be claiming that neither the district office nor the national office of the AFGE is authorized to act as the successor to Local 2082 with regard to the enforcement of the grievance rights of the Local's bargaining unit members. If, on remand, the appellant is able to prove these assertions, then the Board would have jurisdiction over his appeal under FLRA precedent and <span class="Italic">Smith</span>. Therefore, he has made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction and is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 MSPR at 329.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the remand the AJ again concluded that the negotiated agreement precluded Board jurisdiction over Mr. Hill's appeal. There followed another PFR and another decision, but with a different result, <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Army</span>, 70 MSPR 196, 198-202 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective September 30, 1994, the agency separated the appellant from his WG-11 Electronics Mechanic position, pursuant to a reduction in force (RIF) that closed its Fort Ord, California facility. Upon the appellant's filing of a petition for appeal with the Board's San Francisco Regional Office, the agency moved that the appeal be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The agency argued that because the appellant did not allege that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice, his exclusive avenue of appeal was through the negotiated grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2082, and Fort Ord. The appellant opposed the agency's motion, arguing that the CBA ceased to exist as of September 30, 1994, the day the agency abolished the Fort Ord installation, and that he was, therefore, no longer covered by a CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant was covered by a CBA which provided a negotiated grievance procedure as the exclusive right of appeal from a RIF action, absent an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice, and that the appellant did not raise such an allegation here. The administrative judge further found that the appellant was still covered by the CBA because he could pursue his grievance rights through AFGE's district office, despite the closures of Fort Ord and Local 2082.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_414"></span>The appellant filed a petition for review, and, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Army</span>, 67 MSPR 535 (1995), the Board vacated the initial decision and remanded the appeal for further adjudication, finding that the appellant's right to grieve his separation pursuant to the RIF survived Fort Ord's closure and the abolishment of the collective bargaining unit. The Board further found, however, that a question existed regarding whether a labor organization still existed to enforce the appellant's grievance rights under the CBA. The Board found that if the appellant could establish that he is unable to pursue his grievance rights because his local union is defunct, due to Fort Ord's closure, and that neither AFGE's district office nor national office is authorized to act as the successor to Local 2082 with regard to the enforcement of the grievance rights of the Local's bargaining unit members, the Board would have jurisdiction over his appeal. The Board, therefore, remanded the matter to the regional office for further adjudication, including a hearing, to resolve these issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge again dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding as follows: (1) The CBA remained in effect following the appellant's RIF; (2) Fort Ord employees, including the appellant, were advised that they could pursue their grievance rights under the CBA by contacting the AFGE district office in Santa Rosa, California; (3) the agency continues to issue decision letters pursuant to the CBA containing the name, address and telephone number of William Fraser of the Santa Rosa AFGE office, whom the agency believed was the appropriate contact point for union affairs following the base closure; and (4) although Mr. Fraser testified that he agreed to represent the appellant in this appeal only with respect to the jurisdictional issue, because of the union's institutional interest in this issue, the evidence establishes that he and the Santa Rosa AFGE office have been willing and able to represent other former Fort Ord employees in the exercise of their continuing grievance and arbitration rights under the CBA. The administrative judge, therefore, concluded that, following Fort Ord's closure, the Santa Rosa district AFGE office constituted a union entity that was implicitly authorized to represent employees of that closed facility in enforcing their continuing grievance and arbitration rights, and that it was willing and able to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in concluding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal in light of the evidence presented on remand. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our previous remand Opinion, we held that the Board would have jurisdiction over this appeal if the appellant proved that Local 2082 was defunct, and that neither the district office nor AFGE's national office was authorized to act as Local 2082's successor with regard to the enforcement of the grievance rights of the Local's bargaining unit members. 67 MSPR at 539-40. Factors relevant to determining whether Local 2082 is defunct include, but are not limited to, the absence of dues-paying members, officers and offices, the lack of active representation on behalf of bargaining unit members, and the absence of affirmative action by district or national affiliates of the local organization to assume the responsibility for administering the local agreement, or otherwise to provide representation to the employees in the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See Gibbs &#x0026; Cox, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 904 F.2d 214, 215-16 (4th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Colson Equipment</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 673 F.2d 221, 225 (8th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">U.S. Naval Air Station, Belle Chasse, LA and Robert E. Hirstius and International Association of Fire Fighters, Local F-189</span>, Decision of Assistant Secretary for Labor Management Relations, A/SLMR No. 520, slip op. at 2 (Dep't Labor 1975)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that Local 2082 was defunct, the administrative judge relied upon the continued existence of the CBA, based upon its explicit terms, and the absence of a determination that it expired, or became unenforceable, or that the union was decertified. The administrative judge also relied upon the existence of a contact person in Santa Rosa for former Local 2082 bargaining unit members to contact to pursue grievances, and the failures of William Fraser, the Santa Rosa contact person, and AFGE officials, to notify the agency's Civilian Personnel Office to cease including Mr. Fraser's name in decision letters that it issued pursuant to the negotiated grievance procedure under the CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The continued existence of the CBA, however, is not germane to our jurisdictional inquiry here. As we found in our remand decision, there was no evidence of record that the parties to the CBA agreed that their negotiated grievance procedure would not survive the closure of Fort Ord and the abolition of the bargaining unit. Thus, we held that, because the appellant's right to grieve his RIF separation occurred either prior to or simultaneous with the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> expiration of the CBA, he continues to have a right to pursue such a grievance. 67 MSPR at 537-38.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now find that, in light of the other record evidence, the existence of a contact person for former members of the Local 2082 bargaining unit, and the agency's inclusion of both Mr. Fraser's name and information regarding an employee's right to file a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, in its decision notices, do not establish that Local 2082 continued as the exclusive representative for that bargaining unit or that a successor organization was willing and able to represent those employees in light of the relevant factors discussed above. Mr. Fraser testified that he has been a national representative of AFGE since 1989, that he is not an agent of Local 2082, and that his representation in this appeal is limited to the jurisdictional issue because both AFGE and Local 2082 have institutional interests in the outcome of that issue. He further stated that there is no Santa Rosa district office for AFGE, that the Santa Rosa address and telephone number were his business address and telephone number, and that, although he was designated as a contact person, he was not delegated any representational authority or responsibility. Mr. Fraser specified that there is no party willing or able to represent the appellant with respect to a grievance, that the national AFGE does not succeed Local 2082 upon its demise, and that there have been no other appeals or grievances regarding the RIF at issue from any other former member of the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Fraser's statements are consistent with other record evidence establishing that Local 2082 was unable to represent its former bargaining unit members because it ceased to exist on September 30, 1994, and that no other representative entity was willing or able to undertake such representation. In a letter to Local 2082 members dated September 14, 1994, then-President Gil Cortez stated that the union would be officially closed on September 30, 1994, and union dues deductions would automatically stop upon that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her sworn affidavit, Andrea Brooks, National Vice President of AFGE for California and Nevada, stated that AFGE Local 2082 formerly represented bargaining unit workers employed by Fort Ord, but ceased such representation upon the September 30, 1994, closure of Fort Ord and the coincident elimination of the bargaining unit there. She further stated that neither the national union, nor any of its districts, succeeds to a local's former status as exclusive representative upon the demise or inactivity of any local or council of locals, and that this general rule applied to Local 2082 in this case. She explained that the only way a succession could have occurred would have been upon her recommendation to the National President that he exercise his powers under the AFGE National Constitution to succeed to Local 2082's exclusive representative status, that she made no such recommendation, and that the National President did not otherwise exercise his powers under the National Constitution to succeed Local 2082.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the affidavit of Judy Washington further confirms that Local 2082 is defunct for purposes of representing the former members of the bargaining unit at Ford Ord. Ms. Washington stated that she succeeded to the presidency of Local 2082 upon the elimination of the Army bargaining unit at Fort Ord, that since September 30, 1994, Local 2082 is comprised solely of members of the AFGE Worldwide Consolidated Bargaining Unit employed by the Army &#x0026; Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES) at the Presidio of Monterey and its Annex (located on the former Ford Ord), and that since September 30, 1994, Local 2082 represents only AAFES employees, and is unwilling and unable to represent former or current Army employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The foregoing establishes that Local 2082 is defunct with respect to its former bargaining unit at Fort Ord, and that no successor organization exists that is able and willing to enforce the grievance rights of that Local's bargaining unit's members. <span class="Italic">See also Local Union No. 5741, United Mine Workers v. NLRB</span>, 865 F.2d 733, 737 (6th Cir.) (discussing factors relevant to a finding of union successorship)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hill</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 89 MSPR 430, 435 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2001), remanding to develop additional evidence on the viability of the appellant's local union:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reasserts that he is not covered by a CBA because the bargaining unit, except for two members, ceased to exist several months before his separation. As a matter of law, the appellant has an enforceable right to grieve his RIF separation even if it occurred prior to or simultaneous with the abolishment of his bargaining unit. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) has held that the enforceability of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures continues upon the expiration of a CBA, absent an express agreement by the parties to the contrary<span class="Italic">. See Hill v. Department of the Army</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 535, 537-38 (1995); <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force 35th Combat Support Group (TAC George Air Force Base, California and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 977,</span> 4 F.L.R.A. 22, 23 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf. Villante</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 545 (the terms of a CBA in effect at the time the agency took the action at issue govern). Here, there is no evidence that the parties to the CBA agreed that their negotiated grievance procedure would not survive the abolishment of the bargaining unit. Therefore, the appellant continues to have a right to pursue such a grievance because his RIF separation occurred either prior to or simultaneous with the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> expiration of the CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Army</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 196, 199-201 (1996), the Board held that, if an appellant established that he was unable to pursue his grievance rights because his local union was defunct, and that neither the union's district office nor national office was authorized to act as the successor to the Local union with regard to the enforcement of the grievance rights of the Local's bargaining unit members, the Board would have jurisdiction over his appeal. The appellant appears to have made a <span class="Italic">Hill-</span>type claim below in arguing that he was not covered by a CBA because his bargaining unit essentially ceased to exist several months before his separation. Despite the nature of the appellant's jurisdictional claim, the record indicates that the administrative judge did not apprise the appellant of what was required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue on the basis of his claim<span class="Italic">. See Fish v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 540, 543 (1995) (an administrative judge should not dismiss an appeal on jurisdictional grounds without apprising the appellant of the showing he must make to invoke Board jurisdiction over his appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the standards of <span class="Italic">Hill</span> are met, the appellant would have the alternative right to file a RIF appeal with the Board under Part 351.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board decided that Smith failed to prove that the local union was defunct and that the district or national union could not represent him, a result affirmed in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 73 Fed. Appx. 398, 399 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Hill</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Unlike the employee in <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, who presented sworn affidavits from union leaders stating that his local bargaining unit was indeed defunct and that neither the national nor district unions succeeded the local unit, <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, 70 MSPR at 201, Smith offers as evidence only his own inability, despite what he avers as diligent efforts, to contact any union officials. Smith would also distinguish <span class="Italic">Hill</span> on the fact that in <span class="Italic">Hill</span> the agency informed separated employees how to contact district and national unions, which were also informed of the RIF. That distinction is not controlling. Smith has not demonstrated that the agency is required to help employees and their unions contact each other when there is a RIF. Further, the onus to discover facts showing that he could not avail himself of the grievance procedures rested on Smith.</p>
