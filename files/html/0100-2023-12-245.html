<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-244"><span class="space">3.</span> Requested By or For Individual</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In the early case of <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 280, 1 MSPB 268, 281-83 (1979), a Special Counsel proceeding, the Board found no reprisal in the reassignments of several employees. The employees informed the Board that they intended to take their case to the circuit court of appeals and requested a stay of the reassignments pending resolution of the appeals. The Board declined, determining that to obtain a stay the employees were required to show irreparable harm. One of the employees stated that the reassignment would cause him to sell his home and leave his church. The Board was not persuaded that those effects were extraordinary; rather, the Board stated, that type of disruption could be expected in most job changes coupled with a transfer. The Board added as a footnote that it would be possible, in an appropriate case, for severe personal disruption to constitute the irreparable harm required to justify a stay of a Board order. It was noted, however, that there was no evidence before the Board other than vague and generalized statements that were neither verified nor subscribed under oath. The Board also considered the public interest involved, declaring that "[a]n employee whose intransigence and opposition to management at all levels creates personnel conflicts may be transferred to another location as a sound management technique." As to legal criteria for a stay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether to grant the relief requested in this case, we are guided by the principles enunciated in <span class="Italic">Washington Metropolitan Area Authority v. Holiday Tours, Inc.,</span> 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977). In that case, the court rules that an order by an administrative agency to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending appeal was appropriate where:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a serious legal question is presented, when little if any harm will befall other interested persons or the public and when denial of the order would inflict irreparable injury on the movant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">*****</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">What is fairly contemplated is that tribunals may stay their own orders when they have rules on an admittedly difficult legal question and when the equities of the case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 844-45.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Frazier,</span> <span class="Italic">McCreary v. OPM</span>, 26 MSPR 202, 203 (1985), a suitability removal appeal, decided the Board has no jurisdiction to consider an individual's stay request unless there is involvement of OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has jurisdiction to grant stays of personnel actions, it is section 1208 of Title 5 of the United States Code that provides for the granting of such stays by the Board, and not 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3, upon which Mr. McCreary relies. Furthermore, the Board's jurisdiction to grant a stay of a personnel action arises only upon a request filed by the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. HHS,</span> 8 MSPB 607 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1208, referenced in <span class="Italic">McCreary</span>, was superceded by 5 USC 1214, describing OSC's authority to obtain stays from the Board pending investigation or other action by OSC related to prohibited personnel practice allegations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied an administrative law judge's application for a stay of a suspension authorized by the Board following adjudication of a complaint filed by his employer in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Brennan</span>, 27 MSPR 439, 440-42 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">April 29, 1985, respondent moved to stay the Board's final decision of April 15, 1985, authorizing the Social Security Administration to suspend him for a period of up to sixty days. Respondent seeks the stay pending resolution of his petition for review to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its discretion, the Board may stay the enforcement of a final decision pending judicial review. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705; <span class="Italic">In re Frazier,</span> 1 MSPB 268 (1979). Whether the Board issues such a stay depends on an analysis of four factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Likelihood of success on appeal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Irreparable harm;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Substantial harm to other interested parties; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;Public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass'n v. FPC,</span> 259 F.2d 921 (D.C. Cir. 1959); <span class="Italic">In re Frazier,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In each request for stay the Board weighs the likelihood of success on appeal against the other three factors. The likelihood or probability of success is not a mathematical determination. If "the balance of hardship tips decidedly toward [movant], it will ordinarily be enough that [it] has raised [serious questions on the merits]." <span class="Italic">Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co.,</span> 206 F.2d 738, 740 (2d Cir. 1963), quoted with approval in <span class="Italic">Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission v. Holiday Tours,</span> 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Movant must show "either a combination of probable success [on the merits] and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardship tips sharply in his favor."<span class="Italic"> Charlie's Girls, Inc. v. Revelon, Inc.,</span> 483 F.2d 953, 954 (2d Cir. 1973) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), quoted with approval in <span class="Italic">Washington Metropolitan Transit Comm'n v. FPC,</span> 559 F.2d at 843.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent asserts that if the stay is not granted, he will suffer financial hardship. Respondent's assertion of financial harm is common to cases of demotion, removal, and suspension. The harm is not irreparable. If respondent succeeds in his appeal, the Board's order authorizing his suspension will be canceled and he may seek relief under the provisions of the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent also contends that a sixty-day suspension at this time will create a "hiatus" in handling those cases for which he is responsible and will impose a substantial hardship for claimants in those cases. Although this argument has surface appeal for the protection of the interests of social security claimants, it does not show that substantial harm will result from denial of a stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Social Security Administration (agency) is responsible for caseload management, including the timely disposition of appeals assigned to respondent. The agency has not sought relief from the Board's order. Indeed, respondent states in his motion for stay that the agency has already advised respondent by telephone that the suspension has been scheduled. Moreover, the same problem of "hiatus" in the disposition of respondent's caseload would arise if the suspension were delayed until the conclusion of the judicial appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only does respondent show no irreparable harm should the stay not be granted, but he fails to identify any serious questions or to show any likelihood of success on his appeal. Respondent contends that the case "presents questions of law and fact which are matters of first impression and which will impact decisions and work of Administrative Law Judges across the United States in many different agencies." Respondent neither identifies those matters of first impression nor states why he thinks he is likely to prevail on the merits of those matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent has failed to make a showing sufficient to warrant to stay. Accordingly, respondent's motion to stay is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 240, 243 (1995) (irreparable harm did not result from the loss of pay and benefits, since success on appeal would result in back pay; replacement of the employee by the agency did not constitute irreparable harm, since the agency may not refuse to reinstate a prevailing appellant to his or her position because it has hired a replacement employee); <span class="Italic">Harris v. DOJ</span>, 27 MSPR 397, 400 (1985) (restating stay criteria: the appellant would not suffer irreparable harm without a stay; even if the agency fills his position, he will secure reinstatement should he prevail in court).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied an application for a stay that was based in part upon the appellant's financial interests, <span class="Italic">Nadolski v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 192, 194-95 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the petitioner has not established entitlement to a stay. For the likelihood of his success on appeal, the petitioner relies on the agency's failure in its "appeal of the demoted veterans," presumably a reference to the Board's decisions in other cases finding that preference eligible employees who were demoted in the agency's reduction in force were entitled to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">E.g., Robinson v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 307 (1994). However, he has not explained what bearing these decisions have on the Board's determination that his appeal of his allegedly involuntary retirement was untimely. The petitioner also states that his belief in the strong likelihood of his success rests in part on the joint petition for review in a pending case, <span class="Italic">Schechtman v. USPS.</span> The arguments made there challenge the holding in <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306 (1994), the decision which was followed in the petitioner's case, that an appellant who did not give the agency notice that he considered his retirement involuntary was not entitled to notice of a right to appeal to the Board. We find that the petitioner has little probability of success in his appeal on the basis of those arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whatever merit the arguments raised in <span class="Italic">Schechtman</span> have, they fall short of what is required for a stay in the absence of any basis for finding irreparable harm if a stay is not granted. The petitioner's assertion that he will be irreparably harmed in the absence of a stay because he will have a break in service and will be deprived of income and retirement credit is groundless. Success on appeal would entitle him to an award of pay and benefits that he would have received had his allegedly constructive removal not occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). Where monetary relief will make an employee whole, no irreparable harm exists. <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR at 280.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1819"></span><span class="Italic">Dogar v. DOD</span>, 95 MSPR 527, 528-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8 (2004), declined to issue a stay pending judicial review of a final Board order that reversed an AJ's initial decision reversing the agency decision. The Board analogized the requested stay to an unwarranted extension of interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the position of Electronics Engineer, GS-12, effective March 12, 2001, on charges of falsifying documents and submitting a fraudulent travel claim. The charges arose from his submission of expense vouchers related to a permanent change of station from Saudi Arabia to Los Angeles, California. The appellant filed a timely appeal with the Board, and after a hearing, the administrative judge (AJ) issued an initial decision reversing the agency's decision. The AJ ordered interim relief if a petition for review were filed. The agency petitioned for review and provided the appellant with an interim appointment. The Board granted the agency's petition, reversed the initial decision, and reinstated the removal<span class="Italic">. Dogar v. Department of Defense</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 52 (2003). The agency then removed the appellant from its rolls. The appellant has filed a petition for judicial review of the final Board decision before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit<span class="Italic">. Dogar v. Department of Defense</span>, Fed. Cir. Docket No. 04-3020. The appellant requests that the Board stay enforcement of its final decision while the court considers his case. He asserts that the Board's decision will be overturned on appeal, and until such time, he will suffer irreparable financial harm unless such stay is issued. He also argues that a stay would not harm the agency, and that the public at large would benefit from the granting of a stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the discretion to postpone the effective date of an action taken by it pending judicial review<span class="Italic">. Social Security Administration v. Brennan</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 439 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 787 F.2d 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In determining whether to issue such a stay, the Board considers four factors: (i) The likelihood that the appellant will prevail on the merits of his appeal; (ii) the likelihood that he will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (iii) the potential for harm to others if a stay is granted; and (iv) the public interest in granting a stay<span class="Italic">. Griffin v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 240, 242 (1995). The Board weighs the likelihood of success on appeal against the factors of irreparable harm, substantial harm to other interested parties, and the public interest; if support from the other factors is slight, a stay will issue only if the possibility of success on the merits is strong<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts he will prevail on the merits in court because the Board failed to give proper deference to the AJ's credibility findings. He argues that the Board ignored the AJ's findings, based upon demeanor evidence, that the appellant's testimony was credible, and he suggests that such findings may almost never be overturned on review. We disagree. Although the Board must give due deference to the AJ's credibility findings,<span class="Italic"> Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), our reviewing court has held that we may substitute our own determinations of fact for those of the AJ, even where his credibility findings are based in part on demeanor evidence, if we can articulate a sound reason, based on the record, for a contrary evaluation of the evidence<span class="Italic">. Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Where the record is sufficiently developed and we do not rely upon witness demeanor, we may address such findings without remand<span class="Italic">. Rackers v. Department of Justice</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 262, 277 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 194 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). Although we seldom exercise this prerogative, we could not ignore in the case before us the serious inconsistencies between the appellant's account and the documentary evidence, including the findings of the agency's extensive investigation. Moreover, the appellant's account shifted considerably over the course of the investigation and appeal, calling into question any finding that his ultimate testimony is believable. The likelihood that the appellant will prevail on appeal is thus slim indeed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beyond his assertion that he would prevail on appeal, the appellant seeks to show that our failure to grant a stay would cause irreparable injury. After the Board's initial decision, the agency reinstated the appellant and he continued his employment for approximately one year and ten months until his removal on October 4, 2003. He alleges that his short-term loss of employment caused his family financial problems, and that losing his job again would deepen those problems, because he has slim prospects for other employment and his wife, who is disabled, cannot work<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. A movant's predictions about financial losses, however, normally do not justify a finding of irreparable harm if the movant can be made whole, as he can here, should he prevail on appeal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Griffin</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 243; <span class="Italic">Nadolski v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 192, 193-95 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the public would benefit from a stay, because the agency lacks employees with his qualifications. While the agency may indeed be experiencing a shortage of qualified engineers, however, we have held in the past that the possibility for interrupting the agency's workload does not justify granting a stay if the agency has made other plans for the disposition of its work. <span class="Italic">Brennan</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 441-42. Here, the agency's strenuous opposition to the appellant's request suggests that it has made such plans. Additionally, as the agency points out, it would be contrary to the public interest to allow an untrustworthy employee to continue serving in a position of public trust.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, it is important to note that the appellant's motion for a stay amounts to an effort to continue statutory interim relief when he no longer qualifies for it. Normally, when an appellant prevails in the initial decision, he "shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review" before the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(c). Here, the agency's petition for review has already been adjudicated. The narrow language of the interim relief statute does not suggest that continuation of interim relief is possible after the Board has issued a final order. Further, because the Board's final order went against the appellant, he cannot in any case be considered to be the prevailing party, and a non-prevailing party cannot receive interim relief. <span class="Italic">Cf. Aliota v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 644, 650 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 381 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table) (employee not entitled to interim relief, because he was no longer the prevailing party after administrative judge issued on remand an initial decision that completely vitiated a prior initial decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we deny the appellant's request for a stay of the final Board decision pending judicial review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declined to grant a stay application by an IRA appellant who sought what amounted to an interim promotion pending resolution of his appeal, <span class="Italic">In re Carson</span>, 32 Fed. Appx. 537, 538 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The traditional use of the writ of mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1651(a), has been to confine a trial tribunal to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so. <span class="Italic">Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n,</span> 319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S. Ct. 938, 87 L. Ed. 1185 (1943). A party who seeks a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired, <span class="Italic">Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Southern Dist. of Iowa,</span> 490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S. Ct. 1814, 104 L. Ed.2d 318 (1989), and that the right to issuance of the writ is "clear and indisputable." <span class="Italic">Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc</span>., 449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S. Ct. 188, 66 L. Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carson has not met the criteria for issuance of a writ. Specifically, Carson has not shown that he has no other means of attaining the relief required. If Carson prevails before the Board he may be entitled to back pay. If he does not prevail, he may seek review of the adverse decision by the Board and this court. To the extent that Carson is seeking review of the AJ's legal reasoning, if he does not prevail in his appeal, he may challenge that reasoning as well before the Board and this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To consider a stay application, the Board must have jurisdiction over the appeal. "Once the Board has determined that there is no agency action over which it can exercise jurisdiction, it has no authority to make any other determinations or grant any relief." <span class="Italic">Moscato v. Dept. of Education</span>, 75 MSPR 261, 263 (1997). <span class="Italic">Moscato</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Gessert v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 114 MSPR 471, 473 &#x00B6; 5, 2010 MSPB 146 (2010), determining the Board lacked jurisdiction to stay a final decision, denying a request to review an agency's pay correction action, concluding that the agency action correct and that the Board lacked jurisdiction because of the propriety of the agency action.</p>
