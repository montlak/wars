<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-159"><span class="space">1.</span> Breach of Neutrality by Government</h4>
<p class="noindent">The government may breach its duty of neutrality by speech and by actions. As to speech, 5 USC 7116 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;The expression of any personal view, argument, opinion or the making of any statement which--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;publicizes the fact of a representational election and encourages employees to exercise their right to vote in such election,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;corrects the record with respect to any false or misleading statement made by any person, or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;informs employees of the Government's policy relating to labor-management relations and representation,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">shall not, if the expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit or was not made under coercive conditions, (A) constitute an unfair labor practice under any provision of this chapter, or (B) constitute grounds for the setting aside of any election conducted under any provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">[Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-10-166.html#sec2-167">Campaign Statements, Writings, Activities</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The government must maintain neutrality between or among competing unions. An objection to an election was sustained that alleged that management permitted a raiding union access to management's portions of a bulletin board, allowing the inference that management favored that union instead of the incumbent union that had negotiated the right to use the bulletin board. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 9 FLRA 253, 259 (1982). Another neutrality case, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army Hq., Ft. Sill and NFFE</span>, 29 FLRA 1110, 1124-26, 1129, 1132-34 (1987), involved whether the Army violated its legal obligation to remain neutral between competing unions in a campaign by meeting with one of the campaign rivals. The Army met with the Teamsters in Washington, at the Old Executive Office Building, to discuss contracting out problems at Ft. Sill. The meeting was orchestrated to demonstrate that the Teamsters could secure attention in Washington to the problems of Ft. Sill employees. FLRA concluded that the Army breached the requirement for neutrality and directed another election after the incumbent union, NFFE, lost to the Teamsters:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to "interfere with, restrain, or coerce" any employee in the exercise of that employee's rights under the Statute. The test which the Authority has applied in order to determine whether an agency's conduct constitutes interference, restraint or coercion is not the subjective perceptions of the employee, nor is it the intent of the agency. Rather, the test is whether, under the circumstances of the case, the agency's conduct may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate an employee, or, in the case of a statement, whether an employee could reasonably have drawn a coercive inference from the statement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The basic issue...is whether the Department of the Army interfered with or coerced employees' free exercise of their rights to select an exclusive representative. The specific issue before us is whether Fort Sill bargaining unit employees would reasonably infer that management expressed a preference for the Teamsters from the actions of two key Army officials in meeting and dealing with Teamsters' representatives at an October 10th meeting regarding contracting out at Fort Sill. By use of the term "meeting and dealing," we include meeting with Teamsters' representatives, listening to their concerns, discussing their problems, and replying to those concerns and problems. Such replies include the promises or commitments that employees would not lose their jobs and that [an official] would personally come to Fort Sill, if necessary, to ensure that communication with employees was accomplished. If such a preference would reasonably have been inferred from the agency's conduct, the conduct constitutes a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of the events...NFFE and the Teamsters were campaigning and preparing for a runoff election....&#8197;During an election campaign, management has the duty to remain neutral....&#8197;A question concerning representation (QCR) exists when a question regarding which labor organization should represent employees is pending. Should any matter arise concerning employees' conditions of employment, management must maintain existing conditions of employment until the QCR is resolved....&#8197;In the instant situation, while the QCR was pending at Fort Sill, NFFE remained the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit employees in the unit at issue. Therefore, management was obligated to deal with NFFE during that period on matters which affected those bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment, and management's dealing instead with another labor organization concerning their conditions of employment would constitute interference with the rights of those bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts reveal that Army officials did meet and deal with the Teamsters at the October 10th meeting, concerning a condition of employment, namely contracting out, for bargaining unit employees at Fort Sill....&#8197;In agreement with the Judge, we find that this conduct by management provides a sufficient basis for finding that the Agency violated its duty of neutrality during the pendency of a QCR. From this conduct, employees reasonably could infer management's preference for the Teamsters. Such conduct constitutes interference with the employees' right to freely choose who should be their exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Teamsters...argue that the October 10th meeting constituted "consultation" in general, under an entitlement established by the President's policy statement on consultation with organized labor, and the Secretary of Defense's implementing statement. This argument overlooks the fact that under the Statute, management must deal only with the exclusive representative of its employees regarding conditions of employment. Further, during the pendency of a QCR, any dealings must be with the incumbent exclusive representative. Thus, under this theory, any consultations which management wished to conduct with respect to the NFFE unit could have lawfully involved only NFFE....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several Teamsters' exceptions involve matters which generally relate to employees' rights. These matters include...freedom of speech...the right to petition...the right to seek information from appropriate sources within the Government. These issues do not relate to the conduct of the Department of the Army, which is the subject of this complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the Department of the Army violated its duty to remain neutral during the pendency of a question concerning representation at Fort Sill, by meeting and dealing on conditions of employment of the NFFE bargaining unit with representatives of the Teamsters....&#8197;The Army knew of the pending election at Fort Sill. The meeting related to contracting out at Fort Sill, for employees in the bargaining unit then represented by NFFE, and for which the Teamsters were attempting to gain recognition. Thus, management was meeting and dealing on matters involving bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment with a labor organization other than the exclusive representative of those unit employees. Furthermore, Army management conducted these discussions with, among others, three employees from the NFFE bargaining unit. By this conduct, management's actions, reasonably interpreted, showed a preference for one of two competing labor organizations during the course of an election campaign. This conduct interfered with the bargaining unit employees' exercise of their rights to freely choose their exclusive representative, and therefore violates section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It is the goal of the Authority to maintain conditions which will best ensure that the employees' choice in selecting an exclusive representative will be free from outside influence. The same premise exists for conditions for elections of exclusive representative conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. While totally perfect conditions may not always exist, efforts must be made to retain as close to optimum conditions as possible....&#8197;[W]e will direct that a third election be held.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA clarified its approach involving challenges to showings of interest allegedly tainted by improper grants of access to facilities by a rival union organizer in <span class="Italic">Army Air Defense Artillery Ctr and NFFE Local 2173</span>, 55 FLRA 940, 942-43 (1999), deciding that there must be a linkage between the agency's improper grant of access and the union's showing of interest before the union's representation petition will be dismissed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Resolving the issue on which review was granted requires us to determine when improper agency conduct, such as found in this case, mandates that we determine a showing of interest to be inadequate and, on that basis, dismiss a rival union's petition for an election to replace the existing exclusive representative of the agency's employees. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that a showing of interest should be disallowed only where necessary to prevent abuse of the election process and to protect <span id="page_145"></span>the fundamental statutory right of employees to choose their own representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2). As the Authority has previously observed, agency violations of the Statute should only block an election from going forward where they are "of such a nature that it may affect the free choice of employees in the election matter." <span class="Italic">Gallup II, </span>46 FLRA at 1430, n.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In granting review, we noted that the Authority's precedent suggests that an RD must make specific findings that an agency's improper conduct has tainted a union's showing of interest. 54 FLRA at 1490, citing <span class="Italic">Gallup II, </span>46 FLRA at 1431. Our consideration of the RD's decision below, and the briefs submitted by the parties and the General Counsel, persuades us that this requirement is the appropriate standard to follow, but that it is necessary to state this standard more directly and clearly than the Authority stated the standard in <span class="Italic">Gallup II. </span>We conclude that a determination to dismiss a petition because of agency misconduct must be based on specific findings concerning both the particular misconduct at issue and the effect of that misconduct on the particular petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, after finding that the Agency "unlawfully assisted" NFFE, the RD concluded that the showing of interest was invalid because all signatures collected during the period of the unlawful conduct were tainted, without making any specific findings concerning the connection between the Agency's misconduct and the showing of interest. In particular, the RD did not address claims by NFFE that the signatures at issue were collected by employees, rather than by the organizer granted improper access, and that the organizer was properly admitted to the Agency's premises at certain times. The RD's conclusion thus failed to evaluate the actual effect of the misconduct on the petition. Examining this effect requires determining whether, absent the Agency's misconduct, a valid petition would have been filed. Such an inquiry requires that the RD focus not only on the actions of the Agency, but also on the resulting effect on employees and the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relationship between the misconduct alleged and its effect on the petition will vary, depending on the circumstances of each case. As the General Counsel points out in its brief, there may be circumstances where the misconduct involves such active involvement or support of the union by agency officials that the misconduct pervades the signature collection process, leading to a conclusion that an entire showing of interest must be dismissed. General Counsel Brief at 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Hospital, Brecksville, Ohio, I </span>FLRC 302 (1973) <span class="Italic">(Brecksville)); cf. Wright Memorial Hospital</span> <span class="Italic">v. NLRB, </span>771 F.2d 400, 404 (8th Cir. 1985) (supervisory support for a union may cause employees to believe that employer supports union or to fear retaliation by supervisors). However, where the agency misconduct is limited or other reasons mitigate its significance, only those aspects of the petition directly affected by the violation may be invalid. <span class="Italic">See Brecksville</span>, 1 FLRC at 305.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, in order to dismiss a representation petition supported by a showing of interest, we will require that any improper conduct on the part of an agency actually have affected the validity of the petition. Put in the context of this case, if after disallowing the signatures gathered as a result of the Agency's improper grant of access to the organizer, the showing of interest is valid, the petition should not be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD's findings in this case contain no indications that Agency officials actively supported the rival union, or that employees perceived the Agency's misconduct as a lack of neutrality. Rather, the RD based her finding that the Agency unlawfully assisted the rival union solely on its failure to carry out its "obligation to ascertain whether the union has made a diligent effort to contact employees off the premises." The RD made no findings that support a conclusion that the nature of the Agency's misconduct was so pervasive that it warrants an inference that NFFE's showing of interest should be invalidated in its entirety. She also made no findings that would support a conclusion that the Agency's misconduct influenced particular employees in their decision of whether to sign the petition.[8] Under these circumstances, the RD must simply determine which signatures were collected by the organizer when he was improperly admitted to the Agency's premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The dissent equates the Agency's improper grant of access to the rival union with "support" of the rival union's petition drive that carries an "implicit message." There are, however, no findings in the RD's Decision supporting a conclusion that the Agency improperly granted access in an attempt to support the rival union or that employees perceived the Agency action as conveying an implicit message of support for the rival union. This situation is, thus, distinguishable from the conduct described in the cases cited by the dissent, where there was "other evidence," unrelated to the signing of authorization cards, of employer assistance to the union. <span class="Italic">Farmers Energy Corp. v. NLRB,</span> 730 F.2d 1098, 1102 (7th Cir. 1984). <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. Windsor</span> <span class="Italic">Castle Health Care Facilities, </span>13 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir. 1994) (pattern of company assistance).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA rejected a challenge to an election stemming from two incidents of solicitation of employees on work time in work locations by a rival union. The employer did not condone the activity, <span class="Italic">Army Eng'r Activity, Capital Area, Ft. Myer, Va. and Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters</span>, 34 FLRA 38, 43 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During an election campaign, management has the duty to remain neutral....&#8197;Management actions during an election which deviate from this required neutrality and which have the potential to interfere with the free choice of the voters require the election to be set aside....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Director found that once the Activity learned about the two incidents of alleged improper solicitation for IAFF by employees, the Activity "acted quickly" to inform the employees involved to "cease soliciting while in duty status."...&#8197;The Regional Director further found that there was "no evidence that the Activity approved or condoned any solicitation during work time in work areas by IAFF or by its employees[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, where the alleged objectionable conduct was isolated in nature and where the Activity acted quickly to stop the possible objectionable conduct, we cannot find that the alleged conduct had the potential for interfering with the free choice of the voters, so as to present a basis for setting aside the election.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arguable breach of neutrality concerning agency involvement in union campaign communications over agency email systems would not warrant setting aside an election if unit voters were not aware of the alleged neutrality breach, <span class="Italic">PBGC and Ind. Union of Pension Employees for Democracy &#x0026; Justice</span>, 66 FLRA 349, 354 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Incumbent's claim that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial factual error fails to establish grounds for review for a third reason. As indicated, the Incumbent claims that the RD erred by failing to find that the Agency enforced its e-mail policy in a manner that favored the Petitioner. Under the Authority's case law, management actions will only provide a basis for setting aside an election when those actions have the potential to interfere with voter free choice. <span class="Italic">E.g., Army Eng'r Activity, </span>34 FLRA at 43. In section IV.B, above, we uphold the RD's finding that the content of the Petitioner's campaign e-mails does not provide a basis for setting aside the election. Also, the Incumbent does not argue that bargaining unit voters were aware of the Agency's alleged lack of neutrality in the enforcement of its e-mail rules. Consequently, even if the RD erred in failing to find that the Agency applied its e-mail policy with a lack of neutrality, that error was not prejudicial to the Incumbent because there is no showing that either voter knowledge of the alleged lack of neutrality, or its effects on campaign e-mail communications, tended to interfere with voter free choice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management may reasonably control its facilities during elections and prevent unions involved in campaigns from creating internal security risks to agency personnel or equipment. <span class="Italic">Pac. Missile Test Ctr. and NAGE Local R12-33</span>, 31 FLRA 996, 997 (1988) (management sought to prevent a union from releasing balloons with campaign slogans that posed a risk to air navigation on a flight line).</p>
<p class="noindent">Errors alleged involving processing of union information requests during an election were considered, but determined insubstantial, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Aviation Support Detachment and NAIL,</span> 64 FLRA 252, 255 (2009). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-11-051.html#sec3-52">Right to Information</a>."] In a different context, FLRA declined to set aside an election when the employer disclosed to an employee through FOIA a list of eligible voters and the employee then sent emails to those employees urging them to vote against the union, <span class="Italic">NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 68 FLRA 622, 625-26 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as the RD correctly recognized, the Authority has stated in numerous "decisions issued pursuant to" the Statute[37] that the "standard for determining whether conduct is of an objectionable nature so as to require that an election be set aside is [the conduct's] potential for interfering with the free choice of the voters."[38] This standard does not indicate that any particular conduct is <span class="Italic">per se</span> objectionable so as to require an election to be set aside. Thus, to the extent that <span class="Italic">U.S. Army</span> imposed a <span class="Italic">per se</span> nondisclosure rule, the Authority's regulations and decisions have "superseded" that rule.[39] Nevertheless, we reaffirm that disclosing eligibility information <span class="Italic">could</span> potentially interfere with the free choice of voters in certain circumstances, and, thus, we certainly do not encourage parties to disclose eligibility information without the involvement of the FLRA employees conducting or supervising an election. As stated earlier, however, an objecting party has the burden to prove that allegedly objectionable conduct had the potential for interfering with the free choice of voters, and the Union does not show that the RD erred in finding that the Union failed to prove potential interference in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union's arguments regarding the manual and <span class="Italic">VA Dublin</span> do not show that the RD should have applied a different standard to evaluate the objections. As the Union acknowledges, the manual is "not precedent or binding on the Authority, nor [is] it intended to be all inclusive."[40] As such, the manual's quoting of <span class="Italic">U.S. Army</span> does not indicate that the RD erred in enforcing the standards set by the Authority's Regulations and post-<span class="Italic">U.S. Army</span> case law. As for <span class="Italic">VA Dublin</span>, the regional director in that case found that an employee told certain individuals that "their names were not on the eligibility list[&#8197;]," and on election day, none of the workers in the same department as those individuals voted.[41] The regional director found that this conduct, as well as the employee's informing other individuals of their eligibility status, "had the effect of interfering with the proper conduct of the election and may have improperly affected the results of the election."[42] Although the regional director also found that the union "may have improperly affected the results of the election" by providing the eligibility information to the employee, who further disseminated that information, the regional director did not set aside the election in <span class="Italic">VA Dublin</span> based on the mere disclosure of eligibility information alone.[43] Here, the Union does not contend that it presented the RD with evidence of potential interference with the free choice of voters--including evidence that the disclosure of information confused eligible voters about whether they could vote or discouraged anyone from attempting to vote--so <span class="Italic">VA Dublin</span> likewise does not support finding that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the RD should have investigated whether the Agency could have invoked a statutory exemption from any FOIA-disclosure obligations in order to avoid releasing the eligibility information. But the Union does not cite any authority requiring the RD to conduct such an investigation in order to determine whether the disclosure or use of the eligibility information potentially interfered with the free choice of voters. Therefore, this contention does not establish that the RD failed to apply established law in conducting her investigation.</p>
