<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-254"><span class="space">2.</span> Scope</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the private sector, the duty of fair representation arises from the benefits bestowed by the contract or by its grievance procedure. In contrast, in the federal sector most benefits are conferred by statute. Contract benefits for most employees in the federal sector are minimal in comparison to those available in the private sector. Unlike the private sector, the federal sector offers many appellate routes, most of them having nothing to do with a contract grievance procedure. EEO complaints, MSPB appeals, and OPM classification appeals are a few of the forums available to federal employees. Most fair representation litigation in the federal sector concerns access to or use of those grievance or appellate procedures; a few cases involve the distribution by unions of benefits secured through grievance settlements. [Refer to the General Counsel's Memorandum of January 26, 1999, <span class="Italic">Guidance on Applying the Requirements of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to Processing Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints and Bargaining over Equal Employment Opportunity Matters</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Guidances/gc_eeo3%20%282%29.pdf">https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Guidances/gc_eeo3%20%282%29.pdf</a> for additional guidance on the application of the duty of fair representation to EEO proceedings.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Before 1992, the law was uncertain as to the scope of the DFR in the federal sector. But in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Holdahl</span>, 46 FLRA 904, 909-14 (1992), FLRA clarified matters. FLRA determined that a union need only provide representation to all unit members, without discrimination against employees who are not union members, if the union has, through contract or other arrangement, become the only or exclusive source or control of representation or benefits sought by the employee. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857</span>, the charge was that the union declined to provide representation to the charging party in a proposed suspension because she was not a union member. The employee had the right to assistance of a representative of her choice, a right granted the employee by statute. FLRA explained that no DFR resulted, because the union was not the contractually exclusive representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute, the duty of fair representation owed by an exclusive representative to all unit employees regardless of membership in the organization is grounded in the union's authority to act as exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, 28 FLRA at 918. This approach parallels the formulation of the duty in the private sector. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, "Congress adopted for government employee unions the private sector duty of fair representation." 800 F.2d at 1171. The result is that "a union with an exclusive power cannot use that power coercively or contrary to the interests of an employee who has no representative other than the union." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 812 F.2d 1326, 1328 (10th Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>). On the other hand,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]f...an employee has the right to chose [sic] a representative other than the union, so that the union does not have an exclusive power that can be used contrary to the interests of the employee, there is no basis for requiring the union to furnish its services. In [that] instance, the employee's interests are protected by the availability of, and the right to choose, the representative services of another party.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1328.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority adopted this standard in <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, stating that a labor organization's responsibilities under section 7114(a)(1) will be analyzed "in the context of whether or not the union's representational activities on behalf of employees are grounded in the union's authority to act as exclusive representative." <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, 28 FLRA at 918. At the same time, the Authority held that it would not extend those statutory obligations "to situations where the union is not acting as the exclusive representative[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard was further developed by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, which reaffirmed that the duty to represent employees "applies only to activities undertaken by a labor union as exclusive representative." 36 FLRA at 788. There, the exclusive representative charged nonmembers a fee for administering insurance plans for dental/optical benefits. The union had negotiated certain aspects of the plans, as well as the exclusive right to administer the plans for unit employees. The Authority found that the union's activities concerning the plans were undertaken in its capacity as exclusive representative. Accordingly, the union was obligated to administer the plans "without regard to labor organization membership" under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute. The Authority stressed, however, that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">whether unit employees would have been entitled to dental/optical benefits in the absence of [the negotiated agreement] is irrelevant, in our view because here, the Union negotiated not only the contents of the dental/optical plan intended to cover unit employees but also the authority to administer the negotiated dental/optical plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, 36 FLRA at 791. The Authority distinguished the case before it from <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>. The Authority noted that in <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span> the union's right to represent members was not dependent on its collective bargaining relationship with the agency, and the members' entitlement to the benefit involved in that case did not arise solely from a collective bargaining agreement. The Authority also stated that, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the statute entitling employees to the benefits at issue in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> did not specify the particular benefits or the manner in which they were to be provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the precedent set forth above, the resolution of whether there is a statutory duty in this case depends on whether the Respondent is the exclusive bargaining representative of unit employees with respect to proposed disciplinary actions. The Respondent argues that because "an employee faced with a proposed disciplinary action is entitled to a representative of his or her choice and it need not be the Union,...it follows that the Union was not [the Charging Party's] exclusive representative with respect to this issue and thus owed no duty of fair representation to her." We agree, and find that the Respondent had no statutory duty to represent the Charging Party in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority clearly stated in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the duty to represent employees "applies only to activities undertaken by a labor union as exclusive representative." 36 FLRA at 788. Thus, a duty of fair representation does not arise in all circumstances from a union's status as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit; rather, it is necessary to determine whether the union is the exclusive representative of a given employee in the particular circumstances of a given case. The General Counsel's argument that a union must represent a unit employee in a situation where the employee has the right to choose a representative other than the union cannot be reconciled with that principle. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 96 v. FLRA</span>, which involved a statutory appeal procedure, if an employee has the right to choose a representative other than the union, "there is no basis for requiring the union to furnish its services." 812 F.2d at 1328.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the General Counsel's arguments that the Union was obligated to represent the employee in this case, in view of the fact that the employee is entitled, by regulation, to a representative of her choice in the proposal stage of a disciplinary proceeding. Therefore, the Respondent was not her <span class="Italic">exclusive</span> representative in that matter. Under <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span> and <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, it is irrelevant that the proposal proceeding occurs at the premises of the Agency and that there is no third party review of the proceeding until after the final decision issues, as argued by the General Counsel. Similarly, the General Counsel's argument that the Respondent has a duty to represent employees in proposed disciplinary proceedings because protecting employees from arbitrary disciplinary actions "is at the heart of the union's role as exclusive representative[,]" fails to overcome the impediment that the Respondent was not acting as an exclusive representative in this particular situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1522"></span>We also disagree with the General Counsel's argument that because a union has the right to information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, even where it has not been selected as a representative by an employee during the proposal stage, it should also be required to represent all bargaining unit members at that stage. The section 7114(b)(4) duty of an agency to provide information is broad, and "must be evaluated in the context of the <span class="Italic">full</span> <span class="Italic">range</span> of union responsibilities...." <span class="Italic">HUD, San Francisco</span>, 40 FLRA at 1121, quoting <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (emphasis in original). The Authority added that a union "cannot fulfill its representative obligation if it lacks information necessary to assess its representational responsibilities." <span class="Italic">HUD, San Francisco</span>, 40 FLRA at 1122. Thus, a union has a right to obtain information that is necessary for it to fulfill its representational functions to the entire bargaining unit. On occasion, that need will require the furnishing of information regarding matters in which the union does not have a direct representational role. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1121-22. In contrast, as we have discussed above, in certain defined circumstances, the section 7114(a)(1) duty of fair representation has been defined more narrowly and is dependent not on the needs of the unit as a whole, but on the options available to the employee seeking the union's assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the General Counsel argues that because a union has the right to be present at a final action in a disciplinary proceeding after the employee has designated it as his representative, it should follow that the union has a duty to represent all employees in such proceedings. This argument ignores the fact that the union has such a right only because an employee has requested its assistance. As the General Counsel notes in making this argument, the Authority found that excluding the union in such cases was an unfair labor practice "because the agency bypassed the union <span class="Italic">when it was acting as the collective bargaining representative</span> of a unit employee." General Counsel's Brief at 13, quoting <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 43 FLRA 736, 745 (1991) (emphasis added). A statutory obligation to represent the entire unit does not arise merely because a union is accorded certain rights when it decides to assume a representational role.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the Respondent had no statutory duty to represent the Charging Party in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel argues in the alternative that the Respondent has a duty to represent nonmembers in proposed disciplinary actions based on provisions contained in the MLA, which the Respondent negotiated on behalf of all unit employees as their exclusive representative. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the union was obligated to represent all employees without discrimination in its administration of an insurance plan for dental/optical benefits because "the Union clearly obtained its authority over administration of the dental/optical plans through collective bargaining, those plans are provided only in the collective bargaining agreement, and the plans apply, by their terms, to all unit employees." 36 FLRA at 792. Significantly, the statute invoked in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> did not specify any insurance benefits for unit employees. Therefore, the union in that case was able to negotiate the dental/optical plan in its entirety. When the union also negotiated the right to be the exclusive administrator of the plan, which covered the entire unit, that contract right gave rise to an obligation to do so nondiscriminatorily. Thus, the Authority deemed it "irrelevant" that the employees may have had a statutory right to dental/optical benefits in view of the fact that "the [u]nion negotiated not only the contents of the dental/optical plan intended to cover unit employees but also the authority to administer the negotiated dental/optical plan." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 791. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 318, 335-36 (union acted in capacity as exclusive representative when it negotiated agreement to bring asbestos testing of employees on activity's premises, and therefore had obligation during negotiations to represent interests of all employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as conceded by the General Counsel, there are various statutory and regulatory protections for employees faced with proposed discipline. Therefore, those employees would have been entitled to the basic substantive rights provided by statute and regulation even in the absence of the MLA. One of those rights is the ability to obtain representation of their own choosing. We find it significant that although the MLA may impose additional procedural requirements in the proposal stage, such as those affecting the content of notices, the Union could not negotiate the right to represent the entire unit exclusively in these matters. Thus, in direct contrast to <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, in which the union had negotiated all aspects of the dental/optical plan including the administration of the plan, the MLA negotiated by the Respondent does not purport to govern the full scope of rights accorded to employees regarding proposed disciplinary actions. We note, in this regard, that the MLA specifically excludes proposed disciplinary actions from the negotiated grievance procedure. Accordingly, the negotiation of the MLA did not impose on the union a contractual duty to represent all unit employees in connection with such actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we cannot agree with the General Counsel's argument that, under the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> analysis, the Respondent has a duty to represent all unit employees in proposed disciplinary actions because it "has obtained benefits for itself and for all unit employees relative to the proposal process in a disciplinary action..."</p>
