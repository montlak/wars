<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-128"><span class="space">6.</span> Firm Choice, Last Chance Agreement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">About a decade of litigation elucidated the responsibility of an agency to apply the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate an impaired employee through a warning or threat comprising an offer of a firm choice between available rehabilitation and current or future discipline without rehabilitation. "Firm choice" accommodation survived for a time and was embraced by the Board so that an employee who demonstrated that he was a qualified disabled employee was entitled to a "firm choice" as a component of accommodation that could include concurrent discipline less than removal. The law governing "firm choice" offers developed principally as to alcoholic employees, although the Board held that it was applicable to drug-impaired employees. In 1996 the "firm choice" doctrine met its demise. Agencies may still offer a "firm choice" or "last chance," but the Board does not require it as a precondition to the initiation of adverse action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to drug abusers, the notion of a "last chance" rather than a "firm choice" is embodied in Executive Order 12564 of September 15, 1986, "Drug-Free Federal Workplace," requiring agencies to initiate discipline of employees found to use illegal drugs. There was an exception embracing the employee who voluntarily identified himself as a user of illegal drugs or who volunteered for drug testing prior to being identified through other means. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 49 MSPR 77, 81 (1991). The Board has yet to provide extensive interpretation of the disciplinary and safe harbor provisions of the Executive Order, although some discussion was provided in <span class="Italic">Lazenby v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 514, 519-20 (1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>. However, in <span class="Italic">Goode v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3317), the court noted that if improper drug use is identified before the appellant enters a rehabilitation program and the agency acts independently of any disclosures through the program, then the safe harbor program protections do not apply. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-284.html#sec8-282">Drug Possession, Use, Distribution</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-287.html#sec8-285">Safe Harbor Provision</a>"; Executive Order 12564 is reprinted in <span id="Page_3554"></span>Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-283.html#sec8-281">Drug and Alcohol Offenses</a>"; refer to EEOC regulations earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-19-128.html#sec12-124">Qualified Disabled Employee; <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> and Disqualifying Conduct</a>," concerning drug users.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before being abandoned in <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617, 621 (1996), <span class="Italic">post</span>, as a result of the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post</span>, the firm choice accommodative requirements developed through several iterations. Basically, the doctrine called for the employer to warn an alcoholic employee that he had the choice of entering and completing rehabilitation or suffering immediate discipline for misconduct or performance problems resulting from his alcoholism. There were exceptions to the doctrine allowing discipline short of removal and allowing removal rather than rehabilitation for certain types of misconduct or for employees in certain types of positions. The firm choice offer was required only when the misconduct leading to charges was the product of alcoholism or substance abuse. Without proof of causation of the charged misconduct, illegal use or possession alone was not sufficient to trigger firm choice requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 537, 544 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board law requiring a firm choice was set aside in 1996 as a result of the EEOC decision in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, EEOC 03940100 (1996). The Commission, whose decision was adopted by the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617, 622 (1996), <span class="Italic">post</span>, determined that provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act that amended the Rehabilitation Act eradicated the requirement for a firm choice. EEOC explained in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that alcoholism is a disabling condition for purposes of the disability discrimination protections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <span class="Italic">Ruggles v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840216 (November 17, 1989). Based upon the parties' stipulation that the sole issue to be determined was whether the agency met its duty to accommodate an employee with the disability of alcoholism, jurisdiction on the basis of alcoholism is assumed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of a showing of disability discrimination, petitioner typically must establish that there is a causal relationship between his stipulated alcoholism and the attendance deficiencies that resulted in the subject adverse action, i.e., his termination. The parties stipulated to this nexus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, a petitioner must show under normally applicable analysis that he is a qualified individual with a disability. 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6). We find that the parties implicitly stipulated that petitioner is a qualified person with a disability through their stipulation that the sole issue to be determined was whether the agency fulfilled its legal obligation to provide petitioner a firm choice. The clear suggestion here is that if petitioner showed firm choice was not provided, he would prevail in his disability claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of firm choice is designed to force the employee to confront his alcoholism and seek treatment. It consists of warning the alcoholic employee with performance or conduct problems that he will receive discipline, up to and including removal, if he does not enter into and follow through with a program that treats alcoholism.[3] We find, however, that federal employers are no longer required to provide the reasonable accommodation of firm choice under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, because the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 changed the applicable standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;If the employee is already in an alcoholism treatment program, then the firm choice will require the employee to complete the program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that federal agencies shall make affirmative plans for the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities. This statutory provision imposes on federal employers both a nondiscrimination requirement and an affirmative obligation for individuals with disabilities. On October 29, 1992, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992[4] amended section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act to include the following provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title I of the [ADA] (42 USC 12111 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>) and the provisions of sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the [ADA] (42 USC 12201-12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 USC 791(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Pub. L. No. 102-569, 106 Stat. 4344.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Commission and court cases that pre-date the 1992 Rehabilitation Act Amendments viewed firm choice as a form of reasonable accommodation required under section 501. <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Frank</span>, 916 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253 (4th Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">Ray v. DHUD</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03910045 (May 2, 1991). The seminal firm choice case is <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Donovan</span>, 598 F. Supp. 126 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 790 F.2d 964 (1986). Although <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> recited, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the operative "affirmative" obligation language in &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act in finding that federal employers are required to "exert substantial affirmative efforts to assist alcoholic employees toward overcoming their handicap...."[5], the decision explicitly stated that such duty is subsumed under 501(b)'s reasonable accommodation requirements.[6] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598 F.2d 126, 130-131.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In finding that federal employers are required to "exert substantial affirmative efforts to assist alcoholic employees toward overcoming their handicap....," <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> also relied on the Alcohol Abuse Act (also known as the Hughes Act). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at p. 131. This statute, however, explicitly provides that it "shall not be construed to prohibit the dismissal from employment of a Federal civilian employee who cannot properly function in his employment." Appellate courts have rejected the Alcohol Abuse Act as a basis of relief for employees discharged for alcohol related misconduct. In discounting the above language in the Alcohol Abuse Act as only applying to employees who refused treatment altogether or who had repeatedly failed in treatment, <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> at p. 131 cited to legislative history that the court in <span class="Italic">Butler v. Thornburgh</span>, 900 F.2d 871, 874 n.1 (5th Cir. 1990), later observed derived from the Senate version of the bill and its related report. The final House version, which deleted any reference to the failure to accept treatment, was substituted and became the law. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Rogers</span>, 869 F.2d at 258 n.2 <span class="Italic">supra</span>, (Alcohol Abuse Act is only tangentially relevant to the issue of whether an agency is required to provide a firm choice before removing an alcoholic employee because the Act does not prohibit the dismissal from employment of a Federal civilian employee who cannot properly function in his employment); <span class="Italic">Judd v. Billington</span>, 863 F. 2d 103, 105 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (under Alcohol Abuse Act, agencies are "free to discharge alcoholic employees who are not performing their jobs satisfactorily").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;It is interesting to note that the <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> court considered the reasonable accommodation requirement in general to be part of an agency's affirmative obligation that goes beyond a requirement of nondiscrimination or even-handed treatment. In contrast, the ADA's nondiscrimination requirement is broader and encompasses the obligation to make reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These earlier decisions holding that firm choice must be provided as a form of reasonable accommodation are inconsistent with the ADA employment standards now incorporated into section 501. Section 104(c)(4) of the ADA permits a covered employer to hold an employee who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior as other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the employee's alcoholism. 29 USC 12114(c)(4). While the ADA requires employers to consider other forms of reasonable accommodation for employees with alcoholism, for example, a flexible schedule or leave to accommodate an employee's treatment, employers do not have to excuse the violation of uniformly-applied conduct or job performance standards as a form of reasonable accommodation.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The discriminatory enforcement of a lawful policy is of course unlawful. An employee discharged for misconduct can demonstrate discrimination by showing that others not within the protected class who engaged in the same misconduct were treated differently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In essence, the doctrine of firm choice has historically required federal employers to excuse the violation of otherwise-uniformly-applied job performance or conduct standards by giving the employee with alcoholism the firm choice of entering into and completing treatment, or receiving discipline, up to and including removal. We find that section 501, as amended by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 to incorporate ADA employment standards, no longer requires that a firm choice be provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was not therefore required to provide petitioner a firm choice between treatment and removal, and properly removed him for being AWOL and giving false information to a management official.[8] Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner was not discriminated against when he was removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Although agencies are no longer required to provide a firm choice as a reasonable accommodation to employees with the disability of alcoholism, agencies may choose to voluntarily provide a firm choice. Section 104(c) of Title I of the ADA permits rather than requires employers to hold employees with alcoholism to the same performance and conduct standards to which it holds other employees. Furthermore, the provision of a firm choice allows an opportunity for rehabilitation, consistent with the goals of the Alcohol Abuse Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617, 621-22 (1996), adopted EEOC's <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> decision in an appeal from a removal following the appellant's alleged failure to meet the terms of a last chance agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board originally did not apply a firm choice requirement with respect to alcoholism, but adopted such an approach in <span class="Italic">Calton v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 477, 479 (1990), specifically because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had adopted that doctrine in its mixed-case decisions. <span class="Italic">Calton</span> was a case in which the Board affirmed the appellant's removal and found his claim of disability discrimination unsupported. EEOC reversed that decision, however, because it found <span id="Page_3555"></span>that the agency failed to provide him a firm choice before removing him. Pursuant to the procedures of 5 USC 7702(b)(5)(B), upon EEOC's referral of the case back to the Board, we found that its decision disagreeing with the Board was based on discrimination law, that it did not depend on civil service law, and that the adoption of the firm choice rule was not so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law. We therefore concluded that we could not force Special Panel review of the issue, 5 USC 7702(c)(2), (d)(1), because the Panel will defer to an EEOC decision where that decision did not constitute an incorrect interpretation of civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directives, and its conclusion that the Board's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect had a reasonable basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 483 (Spec. Pan. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A significant change in the substantive law concerning alcoholism resulted from passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990[1] (ADA). The ADA provides that a covered entity, i.e. an employer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may hold an employee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism of such employee.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, until very recently, federal employers were required to provide firm choice as a form of reasonable accommodation, as part of their obligation under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act[3] to make affirmative plans for the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities. Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act was amended in 1992 to incorporate the standards applied under Title I of the ADA and sections 501 through 504 and 510 of the ADA to complaints of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (<span class="Italic">codified as amended at</span> 29 USC 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> and 791).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 28, 1996, the EEOC clarified the effect of the 1992 amendments in its decision in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Babbitt</span>, holding that agencies are no longer required to offer a firm choice before disciplining employees with drug or alcohol problems. The Commission reasoned that accommodation of firm choice is inconsistent with the ADA's employment standards as incorporated into Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. More specifically, it held that "employers do not have to excuse the violation of uniformly-applied conduct or job performance standards as a form of reasonable accommodation."[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The EEOC noted, however, that agencies remain subject to providing accommodation in certain other forms, such as granting flexible schedules and leave for treatment. It also stressed that disparate application to alcoholic employees of an allegedly uniformly-applied rule would continue to constitute discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Calton</span>, the Board's disagreement with the EEOC in this case will not lead directly to a Special Panel proceeding, since the instant appeal is neither from a nonconcurring EEOC decision nor, we conclude, a mixed case at all. Nonetheless, we find that disagreement with the EEOC would be contrary to the rule of <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 MSPR at 483, by which we are bound. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holley v. DHHS</span>, 50 MSPR 271, 273-74 (1991); 5 USC 7702(d)(2)(A). Under similar circumstances, we have declined to do so<span class="Italic">. See Hurst v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 282 (1994) (although not bound by an EEOC decision in another case, it is appropriate for the Board to defer to it where, under <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> standards, we would be bound if it had been issued in the same case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> shows that it did not constitute an incorrect interpretation of civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directives, and that EEOC's decision to disagree with the Board's interpretation of discrimination law after the ADA as continuing to impose a firm choice requirement had a reasonable basis. We therefore adopt its rule for this and future cases. In so doing, we overrule <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 57 MSPR 124; <span class="Italic">Banks v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 141 (1993); and <span class="Italic">Calton</span>, 44 MSPR 477, as well as all other Board decisions that may be interpreted to require imposition of the firm choice rule following the effective date of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, October 29, 1992.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walsh v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 627, 633 (1997) (explaining <span class="Italic">Kimble</span>, applying it to the Postal Service, and noting that "employers do not have to excuse the violation of uniformly-applied conduct or job performance standards as a form of reasonable accommodation").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, although followed by the MSPB, was not mentioned by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms v. Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices</span>, 95 F.3d 1102, 1107 (Fed. Cir. 1996). There the Federal Circuit embraced a "firm choice" methodology involving review of the dismissal of a police dispatcher:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the OSFEP and with Singer that provision of a "firm choice" between treatment and discipline is consistent with the statutory requirement of a reasonable accommodation of an individual with a disability. Treatment would seem to be essential to any accommodation for alcoholism. If an individual refuses treatment when offered, then discipline is appropriate. Singer was entitled to a reasonable accommodation consisting of a prospective opportunity to be rehabilitated. The SAA provided Singer with such an accommodation. It advanced him leave to obtain in-patient treatment, and it allowed him to perform his job on a restricted-duty status while he continued his recovery. The SAA's accommodation enabled Singer to perform the essential functions of his job and was thus in conformity with the requirements of the statute....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walsh v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 627, 634-35 (1997), essentially extended <span class="Italic">Kimble</span> to allow agencies to avoid forms of accommodation with the same effect as a firm choice, e.g., allowing an employee a period of rehabilitation as a means of avoiding discipline. In <span class="Italic">Walsh</span>, involving improper disposition of the mails by a letter carrier who claimed alcoholism as an affirmative defense, the Board stated, "Were we to require the agency to defer the action on the appellant's admitted misconduct until it offered him the opportunity to rehabilitate himself, we would thereby be requiring it to excuse the violation of its standard":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we noted in <span class="Italic">Kimble</span>, 70 MSPR at 622 n.6, that leave for treatment may remain a required accommodation to an employee's alcoholism, we hold that this can only be true where the employee requests that accommodation before he has committed the misconduct that violates one of the agency's qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior under which the agency uniformly imposes discipline. However, under the circumstances of the instant case, there is no material distinction between the accommodations of granting leave for rehabilitation and offering firm choice, as either accommodation would require the agency to forbear from imposing the discipline upon the appellant that it would normally apply to its non-alcoholic employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the legislative history of the relevant statutes reveals no ambiguity in Congressional intent to require agencies to treat alcoholics the same as non-alcoholics with respect to discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, concerning the ADA, H.R. Rep. No. 485(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 78, 150-51 (1990), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News at 303, 360, 433-34; H.R. Rep.

News at 445, 470 (all simply repeating the law, that agencies may set standards for the conduct and performance of alcoholics and drug abusers, and may hold them to the same standards to which they hold other employees, even where the unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the employee's alcoholism or drug abuse). Concerning the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 357, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1992), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin.

Where Congress' intent is clear from the words of the statute, and the legislative history does not indicate a contrary meaning, the plain meaning must be given effect. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vesser v.
