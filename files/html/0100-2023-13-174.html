<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-172"><span class="space">d.</span> Remarks to Litigant; Comments in Decision; Conduct of Hearing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Burris</span>, 39 MSPR 51, 61-63 (1988), summarized the law concerning the protection provided to an ALJ's decisional and hearing procedures. One of a number of charges against an ALJ was insubordination for informing claimants whose cases he heard that he was being pressured by his superiors to find fewer claimants eligible for entitlements. The Board declined to sustain action against the ALJ based on the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ability of an administrative law judge to write decisions free from improper agency pressure is at the very core of an administrative law judge's decisional independence. Therefore, whenever an adverse action against an administrative law judge is based upon what is contained in his decisions, the agency must establish that its proposed action does not impermissibly impinge on the right of the administrative law judge to determine the content of his opinions. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Glover</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 57 (1984). Moreover, removal proceedings predicated upon an administrative law judge's conduct of hearings "should be reserved for those cases which involve serious improprieties, flagrant abuses, or repeated breaches of acceptable standards of judicial behavior. <span class="Italic">In re Chocallo</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 605, 632 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency has failed to establish that its instructions did not impinge upon the respondent's right to determine the contents of his decisions or that the respondent's response to those instructions involved improper judicial conduct. There is no question that the instructions issued by the Chief Administrative Law Judge intruded upon the respondent's decisional independence. The respondent was being reprimanded for what he had said in his decisions and was being advised or ordered not to make similar statements and rulings in future decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency attempted to justify these intrusions upon the respondent's decisional independence on the grounds that it was merely trying to put an end to decisional actions which were "reckless" and/or which constituted a "dereliction of duty." However, in support of this position the agency chose to rely only upon sketchy and conclusory descriptions of the respondent's judicial conduct and did not offer sufficient evidence from which it could be determined that the respondent had acted improperly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the respondent has contended that his actions were correct, and that they were consistent with contemporaneous Congressional and judicial criticisms of the agency's operation of the disability program. In that regard, we note that the Committee on Ways and Means, in its report on the Social Security Disability Benefit Reform Act, expressed concern over the agency's non-acquiescence policy under which the agency chose not to "follow U.S. Courts of appeals decisions with which it disagrees, either nationwide or within the circuit of the ruling." H.R. Rep. No. 618, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> (1984) U.S. Code Cong, and Ad. News 3038, 3060.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we note that the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management of the Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a report expressing its concern over the agency's apparent pressuring of administrative law judges to find more claimants ineligible. Staff of Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., Report on Oversight of Government Management (Comm. Print 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And, we note that a federal district court judge expressed concern over the fact that the agency was pressuring doctors to reach conclusions in their reports which were contrary to their own professional beliefs, and that administrative law judges were, thereafter, placing undue reliance upon those reports. <span class="Italic">City of New York v. Heckler</span>, 578 F. Supp 1109, 1124 (E.D.N.Y. 18 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub. nom. Bovren v. City of New York</span>, 476 U.S. 467 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With that as a context, we cannot find, without adequate evidence from the agency, that respondent's comments or actions were either reckless or in dereliction of his duties. Therefore, the agency has not established that it was justified in its attempted intrusion upon the respondent's decisional independence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we cannot fault the respondent's decision to inform claimants who appeared before him of the administrative attempt to affect his decisions. The respondent's notification of claimants was not a flagrant or an actionable abuse of his judicial powers. Considerations of fairness may well have required him to tell claimants about agency admonitions which he believed affected his ability to exercise judicial independence in their cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And the fact that the agency subsequently ordered the respondent to stop informing claimants of those admonitions placed the respondent in an untenable position. That March 18th order gave the respondent an unacceptable choice. He could follow the order and not reveal what he believed to be an unwarranted intrusion into his decisional independence, and one which claimants might reasonably believe would affect their right to a fair hearing--or he could disobey the order and risk additional disciplinary action. The respondent's refusal to comply with this order under those circumstances does not constitute good cause under section 7521.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57, 76-78 (1984), declined to authorize discipline based on a single intemperate remark, not determinative of the outcome of the case, in a judge's decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's second charge is based upon a statement which respondent included in one of his decisions. Respondent asserts that good cause cannot be predicated upon a statement contained in a decision. However, in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman, supra,</span> we held that Congress did not intend to exclude any particular category of cases from consideration under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521. Instead, we held that the qualified independence of administrative law judges protected them from being disciplined on the basis of any charge, regardless of its nature, which was grounded in an agency's attempt to improperly interfere with their performance of judicial functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative law judges system, which was created by the Administrative Procedure Act to assure claimants of fair and impartial treatment from individuals insulated from agency pressures, was not created to provide administrative law judges with a license to include matters of any type and description in their written decisions. Therefore, in certain circumstances, the inclusion of inappropriate statements in a decision may constitute good cause for discipline. Moreover, as we have previously held in a case where one of the specifications did relate to decisional statements, "an administrative law judge can be removed on the basis of actions taken by him or her in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding." <span class="Italic">In re Chocallo</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> 2 MSPB at 21, 1 MSPR at 610 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, however, the adverse action is predicated upon how an administrative law judge has performed a judicial function, we noted in <span class="Italic">Chocallo</span> that the action would be "very carefully scrutinized for adequate bases in meeting the 'good cause' standard." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 22, 1 MSPR at 611. In that regard, the adopted Recommended Decision in that case specifically held, referring to courtroom comments, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Removal proceedings based on what occurs in the hearing room should be reserved for those cases which involve serious improprieties, flagrant abuses, or repeated breaches of acceptable standards of judicial behavior. The [Board]...is not constituted to serve as a performance evaluation board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521 to decide whether isolated remarks or rulings made by an administrative law judge in the course of a hearing measure up to some undefined ideal expected of those who conduct proceedings under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 43, 1 MSPR 632. That ruling is equally applicable to decisional statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Decision writing is a major adjudicatory function and the ability to exercise that function free from improper agency pressure is at the very core of an administrative law judge's decisional independence. Therefore, we hold that when an adverse action against an administrative law judge is based upon what he has written in his decisions, the agency must establish that its proposed action does not impermissibly impinge on his right to determine the content of his opinions. In this case, the agency has not met that burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency is seeking to discipline respondent for a single and relatively innocuous statement contained in a decision in which he found that, on every issue, the record fully supported a finding in favor of the Social Security claimant. Respondent stated in that decision that he made this finding even though he had not been able to consider reports from two medical facilities at which the claimant had been treated. In explaining <span id="Page_2255"></span>why he had not been able to consider those reports, respondent made the following statement upon which the agency's charge is based:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Administrative Law Judge requested that the assigned hearing assistant, [name omitted], obtain medical reports from both sources, however, the record was merely returned to the Administrative Law Judge with no action having been taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In seeking to discipline respondent for this statement, the agency alleges that inclusion of this statement in the decision constituted a misuse of respondent's authority as an administrative law judge for personal reasons which were irrelevant to the merits of the proceeding. Judge Reidy sustained this charge. He found that respondent's inclusion of the hearing assistant's name was an "act of vengeance and acrimony." Although we concur with this factual finding and with Judge Reidy's factual conclusion that respondent's inclusion of the statement was motivated by a desire to embarrass the named assistant, we are not persuaded that proof of bad motive or even proof of a modest adverse effect on office morale can, in this case, support a disciplinary proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination of whether respondent should be disciplined for a single decisional statement must begin with an examination of the statement itself. Moreover, unless it constitutes a serious impropriety, a flagrant abuse of authority, or a serious breach of acceptable standards of judicial behavior, the examination should end there. We are not empowered to authorize discipline of respondent for what was in his mind, but only for what he did. Here, we conclude that what he did was not sufficiently serious to constitute good cause to discipline him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, the statement is an explanation of why the respondent decided the case before him as he did despite the fact that he considered the record to be incomplete. However unkind and uncharitable its inclusion in the decision may have been, the statement cannot be seen as totally unrelated to the case before the respondent. In our view, it would unjustifiably diminish the protections enacted by Congress if we were to allow the respondent to be disciplined for this isolated decisional statement. Neither its content nor its facial context lifts the statement to a level at which we should even begin to consider whether the agency's or the public's interests in the administrative adjudicative process might outweigh the administrative law judge's qualified right to be free from interference in the performance of his judicial functions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Matter of Chocallo</span>, 1 MSPR 605, 609-11 (1980), a pre-Reform Act case, determined that an ALJ's inappropriate treatment of litigants or their counsel may support disciplinary action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This matter came before the United States Civil Service Commission in June of 1977 following the filing of a written letter of charges against the respondent by the Director of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals of the Social Security Administration of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. That letter set forth essentially three charges upon which the removal was based, namely: (i) the disobedience of the respondent in conducting a hearing in a case which had been removed from her jurisdiction; (ii) the refusal of the respondent to obey an order directing her to make available the files in said case; and (iii) the lack of judicial temperament as well as bias and partiality displayed by respondent in the course of three hearings before her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[The] issue, as previously set forth, is whether an administrative law judge can be removed on the basis of actions taken by him or her in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Judge McCarthy rightfully asserts in his decision, an administrative law judge is not immune from review for misconduct, incompetence or other failings in the performance of his/her duties. However, as he also correctly recognizes, important consideration must be given to the fact that in order to carry out the decision-making process in an objective and equitable fashion an administrative law judge must be free of harassment, intimidation or improper influences from agency officials. Nonetheless, this does not give that judge carte blanche authority to conduct the government's business in a biased and destructive fashion which undermines and casts disrepute on the adjudicatory process. The fact that an administrative law judge carries out his/her duties in a hearing room rather than an office does not provide an impenetrable shield from appraisal of performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given these two considerations, a careful balance must be created between judicial independence and judicial accountability. This stance is in keeping with the major underlying purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act. This Act, among other things, gave birth to the administrative law judge as an entity independent from the other functions of the agency. Specifically, that independence was created to ensure the elimination of the conflict of interest inherent in the prosecutor and the adjudicator being vested in a single unit. However, while insulating the administrative law judge from improper outside influence which might compromise the judicial process, the Act also provided for accountability of that judge by setting forth a procedure for removal by an independent body, to with the Board. Moreover, the Act and its accompanying legislative history does not provide any support for the contention that conduct within the course of an adjudication may not be considered as a basis for removal or other adverse action. Therefore, the Board can find no justification for self-imposing such a restriction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board is aware of the fact that this decision establishes an important precedent in this area, it would hasten to admonish agencies considering proposing actions similar to this one that they will be very carefully scrutinized for adequate bases in meeting the "good cause" standard. Imposition of this degree of review in such instances is essential to ensure the necessary balance between the interests to be considered and the Board will not neglect its duty in fulfilling that goal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Complimentary language in email to claimant's counsel, other email forwarded to outside counsel critical of the CALJ, although not showing bias, gave the appearance of a lack of impartiality and constituted conduct unbecoming an ALJ. <span class="italic">SSA v.
