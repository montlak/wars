<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-302"><span class="space">f.</span> Elimination of Position Through RIF</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rogers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 670, 672-73 &#x00B6; 5 (1999), explained USERRA restoration rights following return from military duty when an intervening RIF abolishes the appellant's position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_520"></span>Under what was originally the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, as "replace[d]" by USERRA, <span class="Italic">see</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2449, 2452, where, as here, an employee whose period of uniformed service was for more than 90 days is found to be entitled to reemployment under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4312, he must be promptly reemployed in the position in which he would have been employed if his continuous employment with the agency had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status, and pay, the duties of which he is qualified to perform. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2). Further, where, as here, the employee's position is abolished during his absence for uniformed service, the agency must reassign the employee to another position of "like status, and pay." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a). "Status" is defined as "the particular attributes of a specific position...includ[ing] the rank or responsibility of the position, its duties, working conditions, pay, tenure, and seniority." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">see also Heidel v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 511, 516 (1996) (interpreting the term "status" under USERRA in similar fashion). Thus, under USERRA, the agency in this case must provide the appellant with the appropriate amount of back pay and benefits, as well as an assignment to a position of like status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board elaborated on restoration rights when an appellant returns from military duty following a civilian RIF. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 610, 613-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17 (2001), decided that placement rights generally include vacancies, whether or not those positions are subject to active recruitment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective December 1, 1997, the appellant was separated, by reduction in force (RIF) from his GS-13 Airplane Flight Instructor (AFI) position. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Department of the Army,</span> 82 MSPR 670 &#x00B6; 2 (1999). After the appellant filed this appeal from his separation, the agency canceled the RIF separation, detailed him to unclassified duties at the GS-13 grade and pay, and moved for dismissal of the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See Rogers,</span> 82 MSPR 670 &#x00B6; 2. The administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal as moot. On petition for review, the Board vacated the AJ's initial decision, finding that the record evidence was insufficient to show that the appeal was moot because the agency submitted no evidence on the disputed issues of whether the agency restored the appellant to a position of like status and pay and whether the agency paid him the correct amount of back pay. The Board remanded the appeal for further adjudication of these issues....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ found that the GS-13 Aviation Standardization Officer position to which the appellant was detailed was of like status and pay but that the agency should have reassigned him, rather than detailing him, to that position. The AJ further found that the appellant's entitlement to back pay covered the times when he was performing Additional Flight Training Periods (AFTPs) as a member of the Army Reserve. The AJ did not address the appellant's claim, raised for the first time on remand, that his discontinued-service retirement on January 4, 1999, was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time that the appellant's position was abolished in 1997 during his military service, the regulation implementing USERRA in Federal agencies provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee may not be demoted or separated (other than military separation) while performing duty with the uniformed services except for cause. (Reduction in force is not considered "for cause" under this subpart.) <span class="Italic">He or she is not a "competing employee" under &#x00A7; 351.404 of this chapter</span>. If the employee's position is abolished during such absence, the agency must reassign the employee to another position of like status, and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a) (1997) (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board found in its prior decision, there is no dispute that the agency was required to follow this regulation when it abolished the appellant's position. <span class="Italic">Rogers,</span> 82 MSPR 670 &#x00B6; 5. "Status" is defined as "the particular attributes of a specific position...includ[ing] the rank or responsibility of the position, its duties, working conditions, pay, tenure, and seniority." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">Rogers,</span> 82 MSPR 670 &#x00B6; 5. The agency contends that, after it abolished the appellant's GS-13 AFI position, it detailed him to another office and assigned him the duties of a Standardization Officer, at the same grade and pay. However, the personnel action forms documenting the detail show that, although the appellant was afforded the same grade and pay, he was detailed to an "Unclassified set of duties." This detail, with extensions, lasted from February 23, 1998, until the appellant's discontinued-service retirement on January 4, 1999. The appellant contends that the duties to which he was assigned were not of the same status as his former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this detail did not satisfy the appellant's right to reassignment to a position of like status and pay, for two reasons. First, the appellant's detail did not qualify as a reassignment to a position of "like status" as his former position. The record shows that the appellant's AFI position was formally classified and graded and that the appellant's personnel records identified his tenure as "permanent." In contrast, the agency acknowledges that "a detail is defined as a temporary assignment...with the employee returning to his original position at the end of the detail." [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3341 (providing for, initial details not to exceed 120 days with renewals for periods not exceeding 120 days). In light of the fact that the appellant's former position was not a temporary position, and that his detail to unclassified duties was "a temporary assignment," we find that the appellant was not restored to a position of like tenure and therefore not restored to a position of "like status" in this case, as required by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A), 4314(a), and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a)<span class="Italic">. See Rogers,</span> 82 MSPR 670 &#x00B6; 5. Second, under very similar circumstances, the Board has found that an agency's action of detailing the appellant to another position after the abolishment of his position violated his reemployment rights because the agency failed to show that he could return to a permanent position upon completion of the detail. <span class="Italic">DePascale v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 59 MSPR 186, 190 (1993). During the eleven months that the agency detailed the appellant to unclassified duties, his position of record remained the AFI position, which the agency had abolished, and here, as in <span class="Italic">DePascale</span>, the agency never identified a permanent position to which the appellant could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the remedy ordered by the AJ--retroactively correcting the appellant's personnel records to show that the appellant was reassigned to a Standardization Officer position rather than detailed--is beyond the Board's authority. It argues that it had no established vacancy for a Standardization Officer, and that the appellant's reassignment to such a position would require the agency to create a temporary position, effective from the date of the appellant's return from military duty until his retirement. The appellant does not dispute the agency's assertion that there was no Standardization Officer position to which he could be reassigned. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the AJ's order to correct the appellant's records to reflect a reassignment to a position that did not exist was not an appropriate remedy<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12) ("Reassignment means a change of an employee...from one position to another without promotion or demotion.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the agency had no obligation to find another position for the appellant after it detailed him to unclassified duties because the detail fulfilled its USERRA obligations as long as the agency retroactively corrected the appellant's personnel papers to substitute a reassignment for the detail. However, as we have discussed above, that finding was erroneous. It is therefore necessary for the Board to determine if the agency's actions, apart from the detail, satisfied its obligations under USERRA.... Both before the AJ and the Board, the agency asserted that its efforts to place the appellant in another position were sufficient under USERRA because it attempted to "assist Appellant in finding other positions for which he might qualify during his enrollment in PPP [Priority Placement Program]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the agency seriously misapprehends its obligations under USERRA. With respect to employees like the appellant, whose positions are abolished during their absence for uniformed service, the agency's obligation involves substantially more than assisting the employee to find a suitable position. Rather, "the agency must reassign, the employee to another position of like status and pay," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a); <span class="Italic">Rogers,</span> 82 MSPR 670 &#x00B6; 5, or notify the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it is impossible or unreasonable for the agency to place the employee, thus providing the employee with an opportunity to apply to OPM for placement assistance, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.110(a). Here, the agency did neither.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although the agency's efforts to find a position for the appellant <span id="Page_521"></span>may have been hampered because the appellant initially limited his geographic preference when he registered for the PPP to Department of Defense activities in the Atlanta, Georgia area, the record shows that the agency's efforts to even refer the appellant's application to selecting officials under the PPP were not <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>. During a significant part of the one-year statutory period following his return from military service, when the appellant was protected from discharge, except for cause, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(c)(1) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209, there were eight months (April-November 1998) when the agency allowed the appellant's enrollment in the PPP to lapse. During that period, the appellant asserts that he was not considered for at least four positions for which he was qualified that he located on his own. In response to this claim, the agency asserted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Rogers had been calling units directly to determine if they had any vacancies, and in some cases the units did have vacancies. However, the existence of a vacancy doesn't mean that there is recruiting action underway to fill that vacancy. We cannot fill a position for which there is no recruiting action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this response was wholly inadequate and demonstrates that the agency was either unaware of its obligation under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a) to reassign the appellant or chose to ignore that obligation. The agency's obligation in this regard encompassed all vacant positions for which the appellant qualified that were of "like status and pay," whether or not such positions were subject to a "recruiting action." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a). In short, the agency did not comply with the requirements of this regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we recognized in our prior decision in this case, USERRA required the agency to promptly reemploy the appellant in the position he would have occupied if his continuous employment with the agency had not been interrupted by his uniformed service. 82 MSPR at 672-73. Further, because the appellant's position was abolished during his absence for uniformed service, the agency was required to reassign him to another position of like status and pay, or to notify OPM that it was impossible to place him, thus providing him with an opportunity to apply to OPM for placement assistance. 5 CFR H 353.110(a), 353.209(a). Here, the agency did neither. As we concluded above, the agency's failure to fulfill its USERRA obligations led to a chain of events that culminated in the appellant's involuntary retirement on January 4, 1999. Therefore, to restore the appellant to the same position he would have occupied but for the agency's violations of USERRA and OPM's regulations, the agency must comply with these statutory and regulatory requirements and must retroactively reinstate the appellant with back pay and benefits as of the date of his involuntary retirement. An appellant who prevails in a USERRA appeal is entitled to a Board order requiring the agency to comply with the USERRA provisions that it violated and to compensate the appellant for any loss of wages or benefits he lost because of the agency's noncompliance. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2); <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (the purpose of a Board order canceling an adverse personnel action is to place the appellant as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DePascale v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 59 MSPR 186, 190-91 (1993), similarly concluded that If during an employee's military service his position is abolished by RIF, the agency must restore him to an equivalent position or, if that is unavailable, to the next best position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a)(A)(i), an employee who leaves a nontemporary position for military duty, and who meets certain requirements, shall, upon return from military duty, "if still qualified to perform the duties of such position, be restored to such position or to a position of like seniority, status and pay...." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301, the employee is "entitled to mandatory restoration to [his] former position[ ] or [to an] equivalent one[ ]." <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 77, 82 (1987)] ; <span class="Italic">Malko v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1980). Further, under Federal Personnel Management (FPM) ch. 353, subch. 1-3(d)(5) (Apr. 3, 1990), an employee may not be discharged for 1 year after restoration except for cause, and RIF is not considered for "cause." Rather, a restored eligible employee who is released from a competitive level in a RIF is entitled to an equivalent position as provided in subchapter 1-3(c). Subchapter 1-3(c) states that the returning employee is entitled to the same or an equivalent position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Britton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 170 (1984), the agency abolished the appellant's position as a result of a reorganization and RIF while she was serving a 2-year tour of active duty in the National Guard. The Board found that the agency failed to properly restore the appellant when it returned her to an equivalent position in another commuting area. The Board held that an agency must restore an employee returning from military duty to (1) the same position, or (2) if that position is not available, to an equivalent position, or (3) if an equivalent position is not available, to the next best available position for which the employee is qualified in the commuting area. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the agency characterizes the appellant's placement in the GS-8 Freight Rate Specialist position as a detail. An agency has the authority to detail an employee for any legitimate management reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM ch. 300, subch. 8-3(c) (May 15, 1990). Here, however, the agency has not established that the appellant has a permanent position to which he can return upon the completion of the detail. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chleapas v. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 479, 480 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a returning veteran, the appellant was entitled to be placed back in his position at the precise point he would have occupied had he remained on the job. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301; <span class="Italic">Britton [supra]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">; see also</span> FPM ch. 353, subch. 1-3(c). Because the agency would have abolished the appellant's position if he had been present, the agency was required to present evidence that there were no equivalent positions for which the appellant was qualified and that the Freight Rate Specialist position was the next best available position. <span class="Italic">See Britton,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 172<span class="Italic">.</span> The record as developed, however, does not support such a finding. Accordingly, we must remand the appeal for this determination.</p>

Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-4324-12-0252-I-1 (NP 7/19/2013) ("Proper retention standing may have given the appellant more rights to bump an employee in another competitive position, i.e., be assigned to a position for which he was qualified and that was held by another employee with lower retention standing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(a), (b). However, because the appellant did not meet his burden to show that the agency's failure to assign him proper retention standing was motivated by anti-military animus, examination of the appellant's bumping rights during the RIF is beyond the scope of this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001).").</p>
