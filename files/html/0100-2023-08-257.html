<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-252"><span class="space">d.</span> Union Action on Behalf of Employee</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, an intentional and otherwise timely, but later regretted, election between a contractual and statutory appeal binds the employee. If an employee elects to pursue a negotiated grievance procedure, with or without union representation, he is bound by the election; an AJ cannot then take jurisdiction over the same matter grieved through an appeal to a Board regional or field office. If the employee has a representative, the representative's acts bind the employee. Once the representative is designated, the employee is bound by the consequences of his representative's conduct--acts and omissions. <span class="Italic">Whitaker v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The election must, however, be made by the appellant or by the appellant's designated representative. If the employee designates a specific representative and does not give a local union general authority over the prosecution of an appeal or grievance, an election does not occur if someone other than the specifically designated representative files a grievance protesting the appellant's dismissal. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Dept. of Army</span>, 37 MSPR 56, 60-61 (1988) (no evidence that the appellant or his designee took any steps under the grievance procedure of a negotiated agreement); <span class="Italic">see Morales v. MSPB</span>, 823 F.2d 536 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>. If there is a question regarding the authority of a union representative to initiate a grievance that precludes a later MSPB appeal by the appellant, the AJ must take and assess evidence concerning whether the union agent was validly serving as the appellant's representative when he filed the grievance. <span class="Italic">See Nelson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 58 MSPR 464, 467 (1993) (directing the AJ to also consider whether the contract required the appellant to initiate a grievance); <span class="Italic">cf. Santos v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 384, 385-86 (1994) (Chairman Erdreich's dissenting opinion suggests that the Board allowed a grievance settlement concerning an indefinite suspension to block a Board appeal even though the appellant was apparently unaware of and received no benefit from the settlement). If an appellant who was not informed of the jurisdictional issue until it appeared in the initial decision alleges that the AJ was incorrectly advised that a grievance was filed prior to the Board appeal, the Board will take evidence to straighten out the facts and the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See McVicker v. SSA</span>, 77 MSPR 324, 329-30 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kendrick v. VA</span>, 74 MSPR 178, 181-83 (1997), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 77 MSPR 667, 672 (1998) (again remanding for the AJ to provide a hearing to resolve disputes over the extent that the appellant authorized the union to pursue a grievance on his behalf), required an AJ to determine whether the appellant elected or condoned the election of a grievance challenging his removal. <span class="Italic">Kendrick</span> provides general guidance for AJs called on to construe actions or inactions of appellants whose cases appear to be initiated within the grievance process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC 7121(e)(1), matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of Title 5 which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of Title 5 or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. Subsection (e)(1) further provides that an employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option to raise a matter either under the applicable appellate procedures or under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee timely files a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By law, however, both the exclusive representative and the bargaining unit employee have independent rights to file a grievance over a matter within the scope of the grievance procedure. 5 USC 7121(b)(1)(C)(i) and (ii). Therefore, the mere fact that a grievance has been filed regarding an action otherwise appealable to the Board does not remove that action from the Board's jurisdiction due to the employee's "election" of the grievance procedure over the Board's appellate procedures. Rather, to be outside the Board's jurisdiction, it must be shown that the employee either filed the grievance on his own behalf, or authorized the union to file on his behalf. If it is shown that the union filed without the explicit or implicit authorization of the employee, then the employee has not made an election of the grievance procedure, and the matter remains within the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Morales v. MSPB</span>, 823 F.2d 536, 538 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Department of the Army</span>, 37 MSPR 56, 59 (1988) (neither the appellant nor his designated representative elected to utilize the grievance procedure to challenge the appellant's removal where the appellant had no knowledge that the local union had filed a grievance), <span class="Italic">appeal after remand</span>, 39 MSPR 495 (1989) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant designated the union to represent him in a number of matters dealing with his removal from the agency. Further, although the union asserted before the administrative judge that it filed the grievance without the appellant's request, it did not assert that he was unaware of the filing. Neither has the appellant made such an assertion. And, as the administrative judge found, the appellant signed the appeal form which acknowledged that a grievance had been filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the grievance was submitted with only Tyler's signature and there was no indication that the appellant received a copy of it. In addition, the agency's denial of the grievance was sent only to Tyler and not copied to the appellant. And, although the appellant, a GS-3 File Clerk, signed the appeal form, both he and Tyler have stated that Tyler, and not the appellant, filled it out.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that the current record is insufficient to properly determine whether the appellant elected to file a grievance on his own behalf or whether he authorized the union to file on his behalf, and that, therefore, the case must be remanded. <span class="Italic">See Tetrault v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 376, 379-80 (1996) (remand was necessary to determine whether union pursued grievance on the appellant's behalf). A signed writing by the appellant or an oral acknowledgment that he was filing a grievance would constitute explicit evidence that the appellant had made such an election. Alternatively, the appellant's knowledge that the union had filed a grievance regarding the action coupled with a failure on the appellant's part to affirmatively disavow that the grievance was being pursued in his behalf would constitute explicit evidence that the appellant had authorized the union to present a grievance in his behalf. If it is shown that the appellant did not explicitly authorize the union to file in his behalf, and that he had no knowledge of the union's filing or that he affirmatively disavowed the grievance filed by the union as not being his election of forums, then the matter is within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the appellant who grieved a suspension authorized the union to arbitrate the case, then filed a Board appeal and settled, the Board determined that the appellant's grievance and authorization to the union were knowing, resulting in a decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction rather than dismissing it as settled. <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-0752-14-0794-I-1 (NP 12/3/2015).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The choice is supposed to be that of the employee. What if the union invokes arbitration or initiates a grievance on an employee's behalf? Until its position was rejected in court, the Board's position was that when an employee designates the union as his or her representative for "any proceedings pending before the [agency]," and the union then files a grievance on behalf of the employee, that filing binds the employee and precludes the Board from later assuming jurisdiction when the employee files a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Morales v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 167, 170 (1986). The employee could not avoid the result by claiming that she was ignorant of or did not approve the filing of the grievance. The employee was bound by the acts of her representative. On review, however, the Federal Circuit emphasized employee choice rather than inherent union authority to invoke the grievance procedure, <span class="Italic">Morales v. MSPB</span>, 823 F.2d 536, 538 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Where, as in this case, the union elects arbitration on behalf of an employee, when the notice of appeal rights issued by the agency pursuant to regulation specifically mandates the employee's authorization prior to such election, we hold that the election is contrary to the regulation under which the notice is required. 5 CFR 752.404(f) (1985). In such circumstance, the union's election of arbitration is void unless it is subsequently ratified by the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It thus follows that the Board was in error when it concluded that "the fact that there may have been a lack of communication between [Morales] and her designated representative has no material affect [sic] on the outcome of these proceedings." ...The lack of any communication supports Morales' contention that she did nothing to authorize the union to file an arbitration proceeding on her behalf. There is no evidence that <span id="Page_415"></span>Morales requested the union to file an arbitration proceeding on her behalf; all the evidence is to the contrary. Morales did nothing which could be construed to constitute a waiver of her rights to appeal to the Board, and accordingly, the grievance was void and of no effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stone v. Dept. of Army</span>, 37 MSPR 56, 62-63 (1988), recognized that there may be contracts that allow the union to grieve an action against the employer--a grievance that is distinct from the right of the employee to challenge the same action on his own behalf through either the grievance procedure or a Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although these provisions of the CBA [collective bargaining agreement] may result in parallel proceedings in that the union may independently challenge the propriety of an agency's action disciplining an employee because of a wide impact on the interpretation of the CBA, any other interpretation of the provisions of the CBA would be untenable. The agency agreed to such a procedure in the CBA and the procedure adopted is neither illegal nor against public policy, and this Board will enforce the provisions of the CBA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Emanuele v. Dept. of Transp</span>., PH-0752-15-0539-I-1 (NP 8/19/2016), emphasized the distinction between a grievance filed by the union and a grievance filed by the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the statute governing grievance procedures, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), matters such as the appellant's removal that are covered under a negotiated grievance procedure and Board jurisdiction "may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both." <span class="Italic">Pirkkala v. Department of Justice</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 6 (2016). Subsection (e)(1) further provides that an employee is deemed to have elected to file under either the appellate procedures or the grievance procedure based on whichever she timely files first. <span class="Italic">Kendrick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 178, 181 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By law, however, both the exclusive representative and the bargaining unit employee have independent rights to file a grievance over a matter within the scope of the grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(i)-(ii); <span class="Italic">Kendrick</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 181. Therefore, the mere fact that a grievance has been filed regarding an action otherwise appealable to the Board does not remove that action from the Board's jurisdiction due to the employee's "election" of the grievance procedure over the Board's appellate procedures. <span class="Italic">Kendrick</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 181. Rather, to be outside the Board's purview, it must be shown that the employee either filed the grievance on her own behalf, or authorized the union to file on her behalf. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If it is shown that the union filed without the explicit or implicit authorization of the employee, then the employee has not made an election of the grievance procedure, and the matter remains within the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Morales v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 823 F.2d 536, 538-39 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (finding that an employee did not either request or ratify a grievance filed by her union on her behalf, and therefore her grievance was "void," and she was entitled to proceed before the Board); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Department of the Army</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 56, 59-61, 63 (1988) (remanding an appellant's removal appeal for full adjudication after finding that neither the appellant nor his designated representative elected to utilize the grievance procedure to challenge the removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence on which the administrative judge relied to find that the appellant elected the negotiated grievance procedure before she filed the instant appeal, a May 4, 2011 letter from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association requesting expedited arbitration, does not bear the appellant's signature. Additionally, it does not appear from the face of the document that the union provided the appellant with a copy of that document, and the record does not contain a copy of the grievance filing referenced in that letter. In an unsworn pleading below, the appellant claimed that she did not file the grievance, and as noted above, she further contends that the EEOC found no evidence that she had elected to pursue her removal through the negotiated grievance process. With her petition for review, she provided a copy of the EEOC's decision denying the agency's motion for reconsideration, but it was not clear from the text of that decision whether the appellant had amended her EEO complaint to include her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record was insufficient to properly determine whether the appellant had authorized the union to file the grievance on her behalf, we issued a show cause order in which we explained the deficiency in the record and ordered the appellant to file evidence and argument on the issue. The appellant has filed a sworn response. The agency has not responded. Unrebutted sworn statements are competent evidence of the matters asserted therein. <span class="Italic">See Truitt v. Department of the Navy</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 344, 347 (1990); <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 592, 595 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response, the appellant avers that she amended her formal EEO complaint to include her removal. She includes an August 2, 2012 dismissal letter in which the agency appears to acknowledge that the substance of the appellant's formal EEO complaint included her termination. The appellant also includes the EEOC's decision remanding her complaint for adjudication following the agency's erroneous jurisdictional dismissal, in which the EEOC clearly found that the appellant's formal EEO complaint encompassed her "separation from Agency employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant had filed the grievance, we find that preponderant evidence instead indicates that the union filed it on its own accord. The appellant has provided unrebutted evidence that she was not aware of the grievance when it was filed and has not subsequently ratified it. Moreover, despite the fact that the union requested "expedited arbitration," the administrative judge found that as of December 15, 2015, the date that she issued her initial decision, the grievance was still pending.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the appellant's sworn response to the Board's show cause order, we find that preponderant evidence indicates that the appellant chose to challenge her removal in her formal EEO complaint and that she did not elect to do so through the negotiated grievance procedure. Therefore, we must remand her removal appeal to the regional office for adjudication on the merits.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement may choose to challenge an adverse action taken against them by either filing a grievance or a Board appeal but not both. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Atanus v.

An appeal will be dismissed for lack of Board jurisdiction if an appellant elects to file a grievance before filing an appeal with the Board, even if the appellant later attempts to abandon or withdraw her grievance. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In<span class="Italic"> Morales v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 823 F.2d 536, 538 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the Federal Circuit recognized a narrow exception to the rule articulated above. In <span class="Italic">Morales</span>, the court held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">From day one, Morales made clear, to both the presiding official and the Board, that <span class="Italic">she elected an appeal to the Board.</span> On her initial appeal form she stated that she had not been able to contact the union and they had not contacted her. In her response to the order to show cause she stated that she had selected the Board for her appeal. In her petition for review she stated that she was unaware of the fact that the union had filed for her and that she had elected to file with the Board. Implicit in these statements are that (1) she knew that she had an option, (2) she chose the path of filing an appeal, and (3) she did not request the union to file a grievance for her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Morales</span>, 823 F.2d at 538. Accordingly, the court held that Morales had not elected the negotiated grievance procedure as her forum and that the Board had jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 539. This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Morales</span>. Here, the appellant admitted on her initial appeal form that she was aware that her union representative had filed a grievance on her behalf. The appellant did not inform the administrative judge that she had not requested such an appeal, only that she had "decided to cancel or drop [the] grievance" because she felt that the "Director always seem[ed] to belittle [the] union." The appellant even included a copy of the grievance with her initial appeal form. The appellant and the union also appeared to be in close communication because the grievance letter spoke of the appellant's equal employment opportunity activity, which presumably the union learned of from the appellant. Moreover, the union was the appellant's designated representative during her initial appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the administrative judge notified the appellant of the potential jurisdictional problem caused by the union grievance and ordered the appellant to "file evidence and argument to prove that this action is within the Board's jurisdiction." Unlike Morales, the appellant failed to provide any response. The appellant's unsworn allegations in her petition for review that she did not know about the grievance at the time <span id="Page_416"></span>that it was filed do not constitute new evidence, as the appellant would have been aware of her lack of consent at the time that she told the Board of the existence of the grievance in her initial appeal form.</p>

He received notice that he could not elect both the grievance process and appeal to the Board; he was copied on the email grievance, attended the resulting grievance meeting, and presented arguments against his removal; and he received the agency's Formal Grievance Response, all without objecting to the union's actions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A union decision, without appellant's consent, to file a grievance challenging a performance-based action did not bar the employee from appealing to the Board, <span class="Italic">Stalder v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0432-12-0533-I-1 (NP 8/9/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the decision letter properly advised the appellant that she had the right to proceed by either filing a Board appeal or a grievance, but that she could not do both. The grievance was timely filed on April 16, 2012. The effective date of the appellant's reduction in grade was May 6, 2012, and she filed her appeal on May 17, 2012. The dispositive issue is whether the appellant authorized the union to file the grievance on her behalf. If she did, then the Board lacks jurisdiction over her appeal. If she did not, then the matter is within the Board's jurisdiction and the administrative judge is required to adjudicate the merits of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Kendrick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 667, 672 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By law, both the exclusive representative and the bargaining unit employee have independent rights to file a grievance over a matter within the scope of the grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(i), (ii). Similarly, the negotiated agreement in this case provides that a grievance may be filed by an employee or the union. Labor-Management Agreement between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District and the National Federation of Federal Employees, Local No. 777. Therefore, the mere fact that a grievance has been filed regarding an action otherwise appealable to the Board does not remove that action from the Board's jurisdiction due to the employee's "election" of the grievance procedure over the Board's appellate procedures. Rather, to be outside the Board's jurisdiction, it must be shown that the employee either filed the grievance on her own behalf[4], or authorized the union, explicitly or implicitly, to file on her behalf. <span class="Italic">Kendrick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 178, 181 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Neither party suggests that the appellant filed the grievance on her own.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant did not authorize the union to file the grievance on her behalf, the administrative judge relied upon the appellant's and Leyva-Tracy's affidavits. In her affidavit, the appellant stated that, when she approached Leyva-Tracy for help in filing her Board appeal, Leyva-Tracy told her that the union had chosen on its own initiative and without the appellant's knowledge or involvement to file a grievance because of concerns that the handling of her PIP would create a "course of dealings" that might be binding on other employees in the future, and that the grievance was a matter between the union and management that did not require her consent. The appellant further stated that at all times she wished to file an appeal with the Board, that the union pursued the grievance without her involvement or permission and without her knowledge at the time of the filing, and that she neither elected to file a grievance nor authorized the union to file one on her behalf. Leyva-Tracy stated in her affidavit that the union viewed the matter of the appellant's "improperly administered" performance improvement plan as a serious breach of the labor-management agreement and so determined to challenge it on that basis, that it did not seek the appellant's permission to do so, and that it filed the grievance without her knowledge or involvement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency argues, as it did below, that neither the union nor the appellant ever asserted in Step 1, Step 2, or the request for an extension of time in which to file Step 3 of the grievance or on the tracking sheets that signaled the various steps in the process that the grievance was a "union grievance." Notwithstanding, none of the grievance documents bears the appellant's signature acknowledging that a grievance has been filed. Moreover, the agency's decisions denying the grievance at Steps 1 and 2 are entitled MEMORANDUM FOR NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES LOCAL 777, Irene Leyva-Tracy, Union Representative. And, on her appeal form, the appellant answered "no" to the question that asked "...have you or anyone on your behalf, filed a grievance under a negotiated grievance procedure provided by a collective bargaining agreement?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above, and based on the evidence before the administrative judge, including the affidavits, we agree with his finding that the appellant did not authorize the union to file a grievance on her behalf, that she had no knowledge of the union's filing of the grievance, and, after discovering that it had done so, has affirmatively disavowed the grievance by the union as not being her election of forums. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Department of the Army</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 56, 61-63 (1988). We further agree, therefore, that the appellant's appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge first addressed the agency's motion to dismiss the appeals on the basis that the appellants had elected another forum in which to pursue their claims. Specifically, the agency argued that the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) filed a national grievance regarding the furloughs on June 14, 2013, asserting that it was filing on behalf of all bargaining unit members who, like the appellants, had not filed a Board appeal by that date. The administrative judge considered evidence submitted by the appellants that they chose to file a Board appeal rather than a grievance, that they never contacted NTEU about filing the grievance, that they did not ratify NTEU's grievance, and that they did not desire NTEU to file a grievance on their behalf; the lack of any evidence by the agency to rebut the appellants' evidence; and the further lack of explicit evidence that the appellants requested that NTEU file a grievance on their behalf. The administrative judge concluded that it was more likely than not that the appellants did not authorize the union to file a grievance on their behalf or that they had knowledge that it was filed before they filed their appeals. He therefore found that the appellants made valid elections to appeal to the Board and that the Board had jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeals....</p>
