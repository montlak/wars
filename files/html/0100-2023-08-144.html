<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 213.3102(u) (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_221"></span>(u)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appointment of persons with intellectual disabilities, severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose</span>. An agency may appoint, on a permanent, time-limited, or temporary basis, a person with an intellectual disability, a severe physical disability, or a psychiatric disability according to the provisions described below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Definition</span>. "Intellectual disabilities" means only those disabilities that would have been encompassed by the term "mental retardation" in previous iterations of this regulation and the associated Executive order, Executive Order 12125, dated March 15, 1979.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proof of disability</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;An agency must require proof of an applicant's intellectual disability, severe physical disability, or psychiatric disability prior to making an appointment under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;An agency may accept, as proof of disability, appropriate documentation (e.g., records, statements, or other appropriate information) issued by a licensed medical professional (e.g., a physician or other medical professional duly certified by a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, to practice medicine); a licensed vocational rehabilitation specialist (State or private); or any Federal agency, State agency, or an agency of the District of Columbia or a U.S. territory that issues or provides disability benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Permanent or time-limited employment options</span>. An agency may make permanent or time-limited appointments under this paragraph (u)(4) where an applicant supplies proof of disability as described in paragraph (u)(3) of this section and the agency determines that the individual is likely to succeed in the performance of the duties of the position for which he or she is applying. In determining whether the individual is likely to succeed in performing the duties of the position, the agency may rely upon the applicant's employment, educational, or other relevant experience, including but not limited to service under another type of appointment in the competitive or excepted services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Temporary employment options</span>. An agency may make a temporary appointment when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The agency determines that it is necessary to observe the applicant on the job to determine whether the applicant is able or ready to perform the duties of the position. When an agency uses this option to determine an individual's job readiness, the hiring agency may convert the individual to a permanent appointment in the excepted service whenever the agency determines the individual is able to perform the duties of the position; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The work is of a temporary nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;An agency may noncompetitively convert to the competitive service an employee who has completed 2 years of satisfactory service under this authority in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12125, as amended by Executive Order 13124, and &#x00A7; 315.709 of this chapter, except as provided in paragraph (u)(6)(ii) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Time spent on a temporary appointment specified in paragraph (u)(5)(ii) of this section does not count towards the 2-year requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 315.709 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appointment for Persons With Disabilities.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Coverage.</span> An employee appointed under &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) of this chapter may have his or her appointment converted to a career or career-conditional appointment when he or she:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Completes 2 or more years of satisfactory service, without a break of more than 30 days, under a nontemporary appointment under &#x00A7; 213.3102(u);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is recommended for such conversion by his or her supervisor;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Meets all requirements and conditions governing career and career-conditional appointment except those requirements concerning competitive selection from a register and medical qualifications; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Is converted without a break in service of one workday.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue before this court is whether the Board had jurisdiction to hear petitioner's appeal. Standing to appeal to the Board is limited to "an employee against whom an action is taken under this section." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) (2000). Thus, for the Board to find jurisdiction to hear his appeal, petitioner must show that he was an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). For individuals such as petitioner in the excepted service, the relevant statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) (2000). Because petitioner completed less than two years of current continuous service when he was removed from his position by the agency, he does not qualify as an employee under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Petitioner argues that he qualifies as an employee under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). Specifically, he argues that at the time of his removal, he was not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner joined the agency under the authority of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u), which is one of many excepted service positions listed in Schedule A and specifically provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(u)&#x2003;Positions when filled by severely physically handicapped persons who: (1) Under a temporary appointment have demonstrated their ability to perform the duties satisfactorily; or (2) have been certified by counselors of State vocational rehabilitation agencies or the Veterans Administration as likely to succeed in the performance of the duties. Upon completion of 2 years of satisfactory service under this authority, the employee may qualify for conversion to competitive status under the provisions of Executive Order 12125 and implementing regulations issued by the Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) (1998). Under that regulation, an employee may qualify for conversion to competitive status only after completion of two years of service. The Office of Personnel Management has determined that these types of appointments are served under a probationary or trial period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 20041 (1992); 58 Fed. Reg. 13191 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Thus, an individual's initial appointment as an excepted service appointee under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) becomes final and is subject to conversion to the competitive service only after the individual has served two years of satisfactory service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner here served both his temporary excepted service and his converted conditional excepted service continuously under the authority of the above regulation. Because the temporary appointment that began on December 7, 1998 was not to exceed September 26, 1999 (less than two years), completion of the temporary period would not make petitioner eligible for conversion to competitive status under the regulation authorizing that appointment. The second SF-50 issued under the same authority served as a continuation of petitioner's two-year period to perform satisfactorily for the possible conversion to <span id="Page_222"></span>competitive status. At the time the agency issued the second SF-50, petitioner was not beginning a second appointment. Rather, he was still "serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service." As a probationary appointee serving an initial appointment, petitioner--under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i)--did not have the right to appeal his personnel matter to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board properly concluded that petitioner was not an employee under either subsection of section 7511(a)(1)(C), it lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner's appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the Board's dismissal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Executive Order 12125, referenced in 5 CFR 213.3102(u), makes the conversion discretionary, <span class="Italic">Reed v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 271, 273-76 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant basically reiterates a legal argument made below, that the agency's actions or non-actions toward appellant are violative of Executive Order 12125, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.703, and various provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual. He contends that, as a result of these actions by the agency, he should be constructively deemed a competitive service employee entitled to appeal his removal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Because the issues raised in the petition for review raise substantial questions of interpretation of statute and regulation, the petition for review is hereby GRANTED. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 15, 1979, after appellant's appointment, President Carter issued Executive Order 12125, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Sections 3301 and 3302 of Title 5 of the United States Code, and in order to permit severely physically handicapped and mentally retarded individuals to obtain civil service competitive status, Civil Service Rule 3.1 (5 CFR 3.1) is hereby amended by adding the following new subsection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"(b) Upon recommendation by the employing agency, and subject to such requirements as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, the following classes of handicapped employees may acquire competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"(1) A severely physically handicapped employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"(2) A mentally retarded employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to Executive Order 12125, OPM amended 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) to provide that, upon completion of two years of service in an appointment made pursuant to that section, "[an] employee may qualify for conversion to competitive status under the provisions of Executive Order 12125 and implementing regulations issued by [OPM]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also pursuant to Executive Order 12125, OPM issued interpretive guidance concerning such conversions. FPM letter 306-15 (April 16, 1979). In pertinent part, it advised agencies that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Conversion of employees who meet the requirements of this Executive order will be based upon supervisory recommendation. No prior approval by OPM is required. Conversion under Executive Order 12125 is <span class="Italic">not</span> mandatory for retention in the position; <span class="Italic">however, there should be substantial justification for not recommending for conversion an employee who meets the minimum service requirement and who has demonstrated successful job performance.</span> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must determine what effect and interpretation the 1979 Executive Order was intended to have. To the extent appellant's counsel seeks to urge upon us an interpretation that it <span class="Italic">mandated</span> conversion, we must reject that interpretation. The terms of the Order clearly imply some range of discretion on the part of agencies in determining whether, and when, to so convert an employee's position. OPM's advice letter, however, suggest that conversion should be made in many or most circumstances where the length of service and satisfactory performance requirements are met. It does not, however, imply that such conversion is mandatory. Nor can it be read to create any entitlement to appeal to the Board from a decision not to convert an individual employee. Appellant essentially claims the agency abused its discretion in failing to convert him, and that he is thus entitled to the procedural protections afforded competitive service employees. We cannot agree. Rather, we believe that appellant's contentions concerning the agency's failure to convert him must be addressed through applicable contractual or agency grievance procedures. To hold that the Board has jurisdiction to review that decision would extend our review of agency actions into an area simply not authorized by any law, rule or regulation.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). Accordingly, we conclude that the presiding official did not err in dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of the recent holding in <span class="Italic">Shirey v. Devine,</span> 670 F.2d 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In that case the court found that "permanent denial of the job tenure protections afforded other employees solely because of an employee's handicap violates Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(b)." In so holding it reversed a decision of the Board's predecessor agency, the Federal Employee Appeals Authority, sustaining an agency reduction in force (RIF) action wherein appellant's excepted service status under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) served to substantially diminish his substantive rights <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> his competitive service counterparts who encumbered similar jobs and performed similar duties Nonetheless the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We emphasize the narrow effect of this decision. The legal position of disabled employees...has changed significantly since January 1978.... The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations on handicap discrimination...provide protections for excepted service employees unavailable to Mr. Shirey. In March 1979 Executive Order 12125 gave handicapped excepted service employees relief basically identical to that Mr. Shirey seeks before this court. 670 F.2d at 1205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Interpreted broadly, certain language in <span class="Italic">Shirey</span> would appear to support a finding that the Rehabilitation Act's requirements may have some effect on the 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.2102(u) conversion process. However, we believe any ruling to that effect must be made by the courts or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in their interpretive role, or by the Office of Personnel Management in its role as the creator of regulatory rights to appeal to the Board. We conclude that <span class="Italic">Shirey</span> does not require an interpretation of the Executive Order as broad as that argued by appellant herein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we think it significant that appellant is not without recourse in this matter. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1613.708 and 1613.709, which provide for administrative processing of complaints of handicap discrimination, apply equally to excepted and competitive service employees. Appellant also is afforded full <span class="Italic">de novo</span> judicial review of the agency's determination to terminate his employment under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794a. Accordingly, we do not find it appropriate or necessary to read Executive Order 12125 as creating a mandatory right to conversion or any implied Board review thereof.</p>

The Board dismissed Ms. Van Wersch's appeal because it concluded that, at the time of her removal, she was not an "employee" as that term is defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)[1], and therefore did not have appeal rights under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a). Because the Board's decision is contrary to the plain language of the statute, we reverse and remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;All statutory references are to the 1994 version of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. Ms. Van Wersch, a nonpreference eligible,[2] began her employment with the agency on March 26, 1989, when she was hired in a temporary position in the competitive service.[3] Later, she was converted to an excepted service position[4] pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 213.3102(u).[5] Section 213.3102(u) allows agencies to appoint "severely physically handicapped persons" to excepted service positions. Pursuant to the regulation, Ms. Van Wersch was under a temporary appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 213.3102(u)(1) (The "executive civil service" includes "[p]ositions...filled <span id="Page_223"></span>by severely physically handicapped persons who:...[u]nder a temporary appointment have demonstrated their ability to perform the duties satisfactorily.... Upon completion of 2 years of satisfactory service under this authority, the employee may qualify for conversion to competitive status...."). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has determined that these types of appointments, "made with the intent of converting the employee to an appointment in the competitive service[,] " initially are served under a probationary or trial period. 57 Fed. Reg. 20041 (1992). Thus, in her &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) position, Ms. Van Wersch was a nonpreference eligible serving a probationary period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The term "preference eligible" is defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2108(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The "competitive service" is described in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The "excepted service" consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Unless otherwise indicated, all references to regulations are to regulations as set forth in the 1994 Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January of 1993, Ms. Van Wersch was promoted under &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) to the position of GS-3 Clerk-Typist. She served in that position for two years and eight months without being converted to the competitive service. On September 6, 1995, the agency removed her for alleged unacceptable conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), "[a]n employee...may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." A removal is an action that is appealable to the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d). Thus, Ms. Van Wersch's ability to appeal to the Board turns on whether she was an "employee" at the time of her removal by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "employee" is defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;For the purposes of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, Ms. Van Wersch is not appealing the Board's determination that she was never converted to the competitive service, which would have made her an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). In addition, at the time of her removal, Ms. Van Wersch was a nonpreference eligible in an excepted service position. Consequently, she could not qualify as an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), which applies only to preference eligibles in the excepted service. Thus, Ms. Van Wersch could only appeal to the Board if, at the time of her removal, she qualified as an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, at the time of her removal, Ms. Van Wersch was "serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service." It also is undisputed that, at the time of her removal, she had "completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." Thus, as far as the language of the statute is concerned, Ms. Van Wersch is excluded from the definition of an "employee" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). However, she fits within the definition of an "employee" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). The question before us, then, is whether an individual who is excluded under subsection (i), such as Ms. Van Wersch, nevertheless is an "employee" if he or she meets the criteria of subsection (ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that statutory construction begins with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">See VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co.</span>, 917 F.2d 1574, 1579, 16 USPQ2d 1614, 1618 (Fed. Cir. 1990). If the language is clear, the plain meaning of the statute will be regarded as conclusive. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the language of the statute, the two subsections of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) are joined by the conjunction "or." The plain meaning of "or" is disjunctive. <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1585 (1986) (stating that "or" is "a function word to indicate...an alternative between different or unlike things, states, or actions"). Thus, read literally, the statute says that Ms. Van Wersch is an "employee" if she meets the requirements of either subsection (i) or (ii) of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). Ms. Van Wersch takes this literal approach, arguing that because she fits within the wording of subsection (ii) (i.e., she has "completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less"), she is an "employee" with a right of appeal to the Board. For its part, the government argues that, the plain language of the statute notwithstanding, Congress did not want to extend appeal rights to nonpreference eligibles, like Ms. Van Wersch, who are serving probationary or trial periods in the excepted service pending conversion to the competitive service. Consequently, it intended to exclude such individuals from the definition of "employee" in the statute. In making this argument, the government points to the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case thus comes down to this: On the one hand, we have statutory language that could not be clearer. An individual is an "employee," as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511 (a)(1)(C), if he or she meets the requirements of either subsection (i) or (ii) of the statute. On the other hand, we are confronted with legislative history which supports the government's argument that Congress intended to exclude from the definition of "employee" in &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) an individual who did not meet the requirements of subsection (i) of the statute, even if he or she did meet the requirements of subsection (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Faced with this choice, we agree with Ms. Van Wersch's reading of the statute. To adopt the reading of the statute that the government urges would require us to ignore the meaning of the word "or" that the dictionary, common sense, and the experience of life all bring to us. There simply is no way around the fact that, in the English language, the word "or" unambiguously signifies alternatives. Moreover, we do not see how it could be argued that reading subsections (i) and (ii) in the alternative produces, on its face, an unreasonable or absurd result. <span class="Italic">See Timex V.I., Inc. v. United States</span>, 157 F.3d 879, 886 (1998) (applying the "canon that a statutory construction that causes absurd results is to be avoided if at all possible"). We see nothing unreasonable or absurd about denying appeal rights to an individual who is serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service if he or she has not yet completed two years of current continuous service, but at the same time drawing a distinction and granting appeal rights to an individual who has completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less, even if that individual still is serving a probationary or trial period. In other words, it does not strike us as patently unreasonable or absurd to grant appeal rights to a person who has served in the government for more than two years even if that person has not yet been converted to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that, as the language of the statute provides, an individual is an "employee" if he or she meets the requirements of either 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii). Any decisions of the Board to the contrary, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Taylor v. Department of the Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 99 (1994), <span class="Italic">Kane v. Department of the Army</span>, 60 MSPR 605 (1994), are hereby overruled.[7] Since it is undisputed that Ms. Van Wersch meets the requirements of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), she is an "employee" as defined in the statute, and therefore is entitled to appeal her removal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;By the same token, to the extent that OPM's regulations are contrary to the proposition that an individual is an "employee" if he or she meets the requirements of either 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii), they are invalid. <span class="Italic">See FEC v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm.</span>, 454 U.S. 27, 32 (1981) ("[T]he courts are the final authorities on issues of statutory construction.

In that case, we held that the Board lacked jurisdiction over appellant Forest's appeal because he failed to satisfy the requirements of either 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii). En route to that holding, we stated that "[s]ection 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) provides an <span class="Italic">alternative</span> definition of an excepted service 'employee' who is entitled to appeal an adverse action of the board." <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, 47 F.3d at 412 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have carefully considered the legislative history of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) and the government's argument based upon that history. Indeed, as noted above, we recognize the force of the government's argument as far as what the legislative history tells us about Congressional intent. If the language of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) could fairly be read as ambiguous, the government would have a compelling case for its reading of the statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft v. Quigg</span>, 917 F.2d 522, 525, 16 USPQ2d 1549, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (stating that "[w]hen faced with [statutory] ambiguity it is incumbent upon this court to examine the legislative history to discern Congress' intent"). However, the language of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) cannot be so read. On the contrary, as indicated above, it is crystal clear. Under these circumstances, we are not prepared to allow the extant legislative history, which we have described above, to trump the irrefutably plain language that emerged when Congress actually took pen to paper. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Amendola v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 989 F.2d 1180, 1182 (Fed. Cir. 1993), "[w]hen a statute expresses its purpose in short, clear terms, the duty of the court is to apply the statute as written." We note that if Congress determines that individuals in Ms. Van Wersch's position should not have the right to appeal adverse actions to the Board, it can amend &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) so as to compel a result different from the one we reach today. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Department of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("The remedy for any dissatisfaction with the results in particular cases lies with Congress' and not this court. 'Congress may amend the statute; we may not.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.</span>, 458 U.S. 564, 576 (1982)). However, until Congress takes such action, we must apply the statute as written.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board dismissing Ms. Van Wersch's appeal for lack of jurisdiction is reversed. The case is remanded to the Board for adjudication of the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal policy calls for the employment through reassignment of disabled employees who cannot continue in their positions because of illness or injury. If the employee is not qualified for any other position, the late FPM Ch. 306-9-2 required the matter to be referred to the agency personnel office for consideration of retraining, as long as basic requirements for other positions were met. If appropriate positions did not exist in the employing area of the agency, efforts at reassignment of a disabled employee were to extend to coordination with the personnel offices of other federal establishments in the same geographical area. The Board, however, lacked appellate jurisdiction over a claim of failure to provide proper reassignment consideration in lieu of disability retirement under the former FPM Chapter 306. The employee could pursue the matter through an applicable grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 4, 7, 6 MSPB 619 (1981).
