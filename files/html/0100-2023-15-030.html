<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulation states, 5 CFR 353.106 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Personnel actions during employee's absence</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee absent because of compensable injury may be carried on leave without pay or separated unless the employee elects to use sick or annual leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency that separates an employee who may be approved for OWCP, rather than placing the individual on LWOP, runs the risk that OWCP will eventually approve the claim. The agency may not remove an employee for failing to appear at work during a period covered by wage compensation, <span class="Italic">Baltz v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3129):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the OWCP grants wage compensation benefits to an employee, it is improper for the employing agency to remove the employee for failing to work during the period for which wage compensation is paid. <span class="Italic">See Parkinson v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 552, 554 (1992); <span class="Italic">Stith v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 328, 331 (1984). It is not improper, however, for the agency to remove an employee for being absent during a period in which the employee is not covered by OWCP wage benefits, including the period after OWCP wage benefits have ended. <span class="Italic">See Wright v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 122, 128, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 42 F.3d 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (table). In this case, Mr. Baltz was not receiving wage compensation from OWCP during the period for which he was charged with being absent without leave; the agency was therefore not barred from punishing him for being absent during that period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is improper for the agency to charge the appellant AWOL on dates that he receives or is entitled to benefits for a compensable injury, <span class="Italic">Crawford v. VA</span>, 22 MSPR 380, 382 (1984). <span class="Italic">Stith v. DHUD</span>, 21 MSPR 328, 331-32 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this decision regarding workmen's compensation warranted retroactive application to the appellant's leave status by the agency, and negation of the agency's charge of AWOL. <span class="Italic">McGilberry v. Defense Mapping Agency,</span> 18 MSPR 560 at 563 (1984). <span class="Italic">See Zeiss v. Veterans Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 516 (1981) (an employee in an AWOL based adverse action <span id="Page_2482"></span>may rely on medical evidence of illness not previously submitted to the agency as a defense to the action); <span class="Italic">Nash v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 8 MSPB 8 (1981) (submission of medical evidence to the agency documenting incapacitation for duty due to illness prior to the agency's decision to remove on AWOL charges warrants finding of improper denial of sick leave). <span class="Italic">Cf. Elias v. Veterans Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 1 (1981) (decision of OWCP on employee appeal applied retroactively, causing otherwise untimely application for restoration for duty to be timely). Thus the Board concludes that the agency charge of AWOL is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, since the Department of Labor's determination of the interval of the appellant's work-related disability entitled to compensation included July 19, the date on which the agency charged the appellant with failing to follow an order to report for work, that charge too cannot be sustained. In light of OWCP's finding, the appellant has provided an appropriate excuse, namely, work-related disability, for his failure to report to work<span class="Italic">. See Zeiss,</span> <span class="Italic">supra; Nash, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bruton v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 271, 274 &#x00B6; 11, 2008 MSPB 150 (2008) ("An adverse action based on a charge of AWOL cannot be sustained if OWCP determines that the employee was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire time period charged as AWOL."); An adverse action based on AWOL cannot be sustained when OWCP determines the employee to be entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire period charged as AWOL. <span class="Italic">Melendez v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the record does not show that the appellant had a continuing compensable injury at the time of the charged AWOL, it is immaterial that he had an OWCP appeal pending. <span class="Italic">Foreman v.

If the prior removal is reversed because OWCP makes an affirmative benefit determination, even though the Board and a reviewing court have earlier litigated the merits of the removal, the agency may not avoid reinstatement of the employee by lodging charges that it could have, but did not, assert in the first removal action<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Green v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 289, 292-93 (1991). [Refer to Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-206.html#sec14-206">AWOL Covered by Period of Compensation</a>," concerning restoration rights.] Although a charge of AWOL cannot be sustained if the appellant shows that his absence was substantially related to a compensable injury, the fact that OWCP awarded him compensation for absence resulting from his work-related injury will not excuse other absence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 552, 556 (1992); <span class="Italic">Richards v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 50, 54-55 (1984) (employee was properly removed and properly denied restoration rights because most of his unexcused absence was not substantially related to a compensable injury); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Baltz v.

Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3129) (distinguishing an impermissible charge of absence while the employee was receiving OWCP wage compensation from a period where the employee obtains only reimbursement for medical expenses). <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 122, 128-29 (1994), explained how AWOL may result in removal of an employee whose absence results only in part from a period of OWCP coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who has been removed for cause, other than a compensable injury, is not entitled to restoration and cannot appeal to the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Minor v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 819 F.2d at 282 (citing <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). The question then is whether the appellant was separated as a result of her compensable injury or for reasons substantially related to her compensable injury<span class="Italic">. See Minor v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. and n.3; <span class="Italic">Brown-Cummings v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 39 MSPR 627, 630 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the charge of AWOL for February 12, 1991, through July 3, 1991, could not be sustained because the appellant was awarded compensation for her work-related injury for the period ending on June 2, 1991. She found that the remaining period should not have been charged to AWOL because the agency should have permitted the appellant to continue to perform the limited duties she had been performing at various agency locations since December 22, 1987. Moreover, she found that the appellant should not have been charged with failure to respond to the agency directives to return to work or submit substantiating medical evidence in February and March 1991, because such directives would never have been issued but for the improper AWOL charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The Board has held that a removal action based on AWOL cannot be sustained where OWCP determines that the employee was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire period charged to AWOL. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. US Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 552, 554 (1992). In the instant case, the compensation benefits terminated on June 2, 1991, and, thus, were not awarded for the entire period of the appellant's absence. Had the appellant accepted the agency's reasonable offer of a position in the CFS Unit, she would not have been on AWOL for the period from June 3, 1991, through July 3, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant did not respond to the agency's February 28 and March 27, 1991 letters instructing her to report for duty or to submit medical evidence substantiating her continuing absence. At the hearing, the appellant acknowledged that she did not respond. Even if the appellant believed that there was no need to submit medical evidence, she should have obeyed the agency's directions and grieved the matter later. <span class="Italic">See Gragg v. U.S. Air Force,</span> 11 MSPB 546, 13 MSPR 296, 299 (1982), <span class="Italic">dismissed,</span> 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The appellant has made no showing that her failure to submit the requested medical documentation was related to her compensable injury. The only relationship we can discern is that, absent the injury, there would have been no need for medical documentation. <span class="Italic">See Brown-Cummings v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 39 MSPR at 630-31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that, because the appellant was removed on bases not resulting from, or substantially related to, her compensable injury, she has no entitlement to restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The situation is different if the employee is out of work and not receiving OWCP wage compensation during the pendency of an OWCP claim. <span class="Italic">See Baltz,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under regulations that became effective in 1988, reviewed in <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 43 MSPR 558, 563 (1990) (recognizing a change in the regulations at 5 CFR Part 353, effective February 16, 1988), agencies are not required to carry an employee suffering from a compensable injury in an LWOP status during at least the first year that the employee receives injury compensation. The fully recovered employee has restoration rights for the first year from the date eligibility for compensation beings. 5 CFR 353.301 (2022). Although the employee retains restoration rights, under the implementing former FPM guidance, FPM Ch. 353, 2-3c (2/24/88), the agency may separate an injured employee "according to its needs and the circumstances in each case." Previously, when an employee received workers' compensation, 5 CFR 353.105 (1985) mandated that he be granted LWOP for at least the first year he received injury compensation; removal for AWOL was improper if the employee was entitled to LWOP. <span class="Italic">Hardin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 18 MSPR 42, 45 (1983) (sustaining suspension, rather than removal, based on a sustained charge that the employee failed to comply with an agency order to provide documentation of the reasons for his absence). The preexisting situation was described in <span class="Italic">Stith v. DHUD</span>, 21 MSPR 328, 331 n.3 (1984) ("The Board notes that an employee who is receiving workers compensation benefits need not be granted LWOP indefinitely. An agency may remove an employee who is unable to perform the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spigner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 10 MSPB 59 (1982) (the efficiency of the service is promoted by the removal of an employee who has long remained physically unable to meet the requirements of his position). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hardin v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 42 (1983) (agencies should carry injured employees in LWOP status for at least the first year in which the employee receives injury compensation under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained the agency discretion in the separation of an employee who is out of work and on LWOP because of an OWCP compensable injury, <span class="Italic">White v. USPS,</span> 168 Fed. Appx. 409, 411-13 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Mr. White cites three MSPB cases as authority for the proposition that an employee may not be terminated from his employment for an OWCP compensable, injury. These cases, however, require only that when an employee <span class="Italic">is</span> separated for reasons substantially related to his compensable injury, he is entitled to priority restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Roche v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 828 F.2d 1555, 1557 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">McCoy v. Dep't of Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 636, 638 (1984); <span class="Italic">Ruppert v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 593, 595-96 n.2 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. White argues that OWCP regulations do not permit termination due to an OWCP compensable injury, but points to no particular regulation as support. Indeed, OWCP regulations are not inconsistent with separating an employee receiving worker's compensation due to the injury for which compensation is based. Under these regulations, if an employee has been separated, he may apply for reinstatement to the employer once he experiences a partial or full recovery....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2483"></span>It appears Mr. White's real concern may be that he will be precluded from reinstatement to the USPS once he recovers because he will be off the rolls. However, an employee receiving benefits from OWCP retains a priority right of reinstatement when he has fully or partially recovered from the compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301 (2005). If he seeks reinstatement and is denied, Mr. White "could appeal the denial of restoration rights if he could show that his removal was the result of a compensable injury or was substantially related to a compensable injury." <span class="Italic">Roche</span>, 828 F.2d at 1557.</p>
