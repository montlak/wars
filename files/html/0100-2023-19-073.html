<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-69"><span class="space">c.</span> Other Mental Disability; Proof of Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Perception by an agency manager that the appellant is emotionally unstable does not establish a disability if management did not view the appellant as being generally foreclosed from her line of work. <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 462, 470 (1993). Assuming the existence of a mental impairment, the appellant must still be able to perform essential functions of a position with or without accommodation, as the Board noted when it reviewed an arbitration award in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 55 MSPR 451, 457 (1992), involving the performance-based removal of a GS-5 Geographic Technician who asserted the defense of disability discrimination based on a learning disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the arbitrator found that the appellant's learning disability was a "handicapping condition" but found, in effect, that he was not a "qualified handicapped person" because there was no showing that he could perform the "essential functions" of his position or any other job at issue "with or without accommodation." Moreover, the arbitrator found that the agency had offered the appellant a lower-graded, GS-4 position, which he rejected<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 19. Accordingly, the arbitrator properly found that the appellant had not shown handicap discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Wilson v. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service</span>, [MSPB Docket No. CB7121920016Vl, slip op. at 5-6 (Aug. 10, 1992).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was properly removed for mental instability after OPM declined to approve disability retirement. She behaved in an erratic manner around patients at the VA installation where she was a nurse, and she had declined a reassignment and downgrading to a housekeeping assistant job. The agency was concerned that negligence resulting from her erratic behavior might lead to liability were there a patient injury. The Board determined that if she demonstrated a mental disability, the agency offered reasonable accommodation. The agency was under no duty to petition OPM for reconsideration of its negative disability retirement decision. <span class="Italic">Dempsey v. VA</span>, 8 MSPR 222, 228, 7 MSPB 693 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 13 MSPR 389, 391 (1982) (sustaining removal for unacceptable performance; as to claimed mental problems, the appellant maintained during his employment that an accident caused no mental or physical condition that prevented him from performing his work and, further, the appellant declined an opportunity for reassignment); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bagian v. OPM</span>, 9 MSPR 541, 544-45 (1982) (Board lacked jurisdiction over a claim of disability discrimination raised on appeal from <span id="Page_3459"></span>an annuity denial; there was no evidence showing that the basis for denial was discriminatory). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-19-079.html#sec12-75">Dangerousness; Risk Assessment; Direct Threat</a>," within "<a href="0100-2023-19-078.html#sec12-74">Qualified Disabled Employee</a>"; refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-318.html#sec8-296">Medical Inability to Perform</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was demoted from computer operations supervisor to housekeeping aid because he lost a security clearance when he was convicted of an off-duty sexual child abuse charge. The employee claimed that he was discriminated against because of his condition, diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, leading to treatment as a condition of his probation following the conviction. The court found no merit in the discrimination charge: the Rehabilitation Act extends protections to those individuals otherwise qualified for positions they seek or hold and who, except for the disability, are completely qualified. The loss of the security clearance meant that the employee was no longer qualified for the position; there was no actionable discrimination. <span class="Italic">Swann v. Walters</span>, 620 F. Supp. 741 (D.D.C. 1984). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-079.html#sec8-79">Security Clearance Revocation; Sensitive Position</a>."] The discharge of a postmaster for a charge of off-duty lewd conduct and lying to police was sustained over a defense of disability discrimination. A prior reference of the appellant to psychiatric counseling was reasonable accommodation. The prognosis was guarded, indicating that the appellant was not a qualified disabled employee. <span class="Italic">DeDonato v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 286, 290-93 (1984), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded on other grounds</span>, 785 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency need not accommodate emotional problems if doing so would eliminate or substantially alter essential duties of the job. <span class="Italic">Peru v.

DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 138, 147 (1993) (removal sustained of a deputy marshal disqualified from carrying a weapon because of an alleged delusional paranoid disorder) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Haas v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 36 (2022), to the extent that the Board applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 to a charge of medical inability when the appellant was removed based on his current medical condition or impairment); <span class="Italic">Pickut v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 433, 435 (1984) (similar to <span class="Italic">Lassiter</span>; there was no duty to accommodate an employee who could not carry a firearm, as required by his position, but the agency tried to reassign the employee without success and gave the employee eight months of restricted duty to seek psychotherapy or to rehabilitate himself). An individual is not a qualified disabled person if his absences would continue indefinitely as a result of his mental condition and his presence in the workplace would be hazardous to him as well as to others. <span class="Italic">Chatelain v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 46, 47 (1985). [Refer to Chapter 6 "<a href="0100-2023-13-069.html#sec6-69">Agency-Initiated Retirement</a>" concerning persons whose misbehavior or misconduct appears to be the product of mental disability; refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-069.html#sec7-68">Psychological Problem; Illness or Treatment; Stress</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the existence of the defense, one must prove an impairment or illness to establish a mental disability. Widely different opinions as to an appellant's condition do not prove a mental disability. <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 72, 75-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (1986). Inconclusive opinions will not establish the disability. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 173, 175 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 424, 426 (1986) (medical report was discounted because of a short evaluation period and the absence of psychological testing). "[P]oor judgment, irresponsible behavior, and poor impulse control" do not amount to a disability without further medical analysis and explanation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daley v. Koch</span>, 892 F.2d 212, 215 (3d Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects that medical proof will be offered explaining the cause and history of the disease, e.g., anxiety disorder or PTSD, and how the disease directly caused the misconduct involved in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Ensinger v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 430, 434 (1988) (it was likely that an anxiety disorder resulted from the stress of impending disciplinary action rather than from PTSD (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Villanueva v.

DHUD</span>, 12 MSPR 607, 610 (1982) (although there was a history of past depression, appellant was symptom-free during his appraisal period). If depression results in poor concentration, precluding an employee from required work with heavy machinery, it cannot be said that the agency can accommodate the condition based on a psychiatrist's testimony that the appellant's condition could improve with treatment upon his return to work, when the doctor did not indicate how long the treatment would last or how successful it would be. <span class="Italic">De La Cruz v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 610, 613 (1991). Treatable mental illness was considered a disability in <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 291 (1985) (Table). The Board determined that although medication controlled the appellant's chronic paranoid schizophrenia, the condition was a medical impairment that limits one or more major life activities. The appellant was considered a qualified disabled person because, with appropriate medication, he was able to perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Direct evidence may establish discrimination based on mental disability, <span class="Italic">Brott v. GSA</span>, 116 MSPR 410, 415-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-20, 2011 MSPB 52 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may meet his burden of persuasion in a disability discrimination case through direct or circumstantial evidence.<span class="Italic"> See Sarratt v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6; 12 (2001). Direct evidence of discrimination may be any statement made by an employer that (1) reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude, and (2) bears directly on the contested employment decision. <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13 (2000). Direct evidence "is composed of 'only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate' on the basis of some impermissible factor. If an alleged discriminatory statement at best merely suggests a discriminatory motive, then it is only circumstantial evidence." <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 7 n.2 (2010) (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge incorrectly found that the appellant presented direct evidence of discrimination because the remarks on which she relied did not bear directly on the appellant's removal. As explained below, we find that this error did not harm the parties' substantive rights, <span class="Italic">see Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984), because the appellant's circumstantial evidence of disability discrimination established by preponderant evidence that the agency removed him because of his disability, mental retardation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's circumstantial evidence of disability discrimination is very strong. Before the removal action, the appellant's supervisor called him a "retard" directly and he repeated it in the presence of others, including the union representative in the appellant's area, to whom he stated that he had told the appellant that he was a "fucking retard." There is no indication that this supervisor's attitude toward the appellant changed from the time that he made the disparaging remark about the appellant's mental limitations until the time that his records became the basis of the adverse action against the appellant. Although the supervisor testified that he did not call the appellant a "retard," the administrative judge found his very limited testimony not credible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, there is no evidence that the supervisor counseled other employees to cease calling the appellant a "retard." The practice of coworkers harassing the appellant by calling him a "retard" continued up to the time of the incidents on which basis the agency charged the appellant with misconduct. The appellant testified that he used the abusive language that made up one element of the sustained charge in response to a coworker calling him a "retard."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's supervisor was not the proposing or deciding official in the removal action, most of the evidence in support of charges (1) and (2), and all of the evidence in support of charge (3) came from this supervisor's Record of Infraction. Thus, not only is the agency's action against the appellant weak because it failed to prove three of the four charges against the appellant, but, as detailed above, the appellant established that this supervisor's discriminatory attitude permeated the entire action. <span class="Italic">See Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture</span>, 235 F.3d 219, 226-27 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding in an ADEA case that if an employee demonstrates that others had influence or leverage over the official decision maker, it is proper to impute their discriminatory attitudes, as evidenced in that case by discriminatory remarks, to the formal decision maker).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has established by preponderant evidence that his disability "had a determinative influence" on the agency's decision to remove him. <span class="Italic">See Gross</span>, 129 S. Ct. at 2350. Reversal of the removal action is therefore appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a distinction between mental disability asserted as an affirmative defense and an emotional disorder offered as a mitigating factor to a penalty that is arguably unduly harsh. Evidence of emotional problems, presented to support the argument that a penalty was too severe, is not the same as a disability discrimination defense supported with the proof that defense requires. <span class="Italic">McKowen v. MSPB</span>, 703 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1983). [Refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-069.html#sec7-68">Psychological Problem; Illness or Treatment; Stress</a>," concerning mental impairment as a mitigating factor; refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-138.html#sec6-137">Personal Fault</a>."]</p>
