<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Velez v. DHS</span>, 101 MSPR 650, 656 &#x00B6; 11, 2006 MSPB 116 (2006), defined negligence with reference to an adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Culpable negligence in the performance of official duties is a failure to exercise the degree of care required under the particular circumstances, which a person of ordinary prudence in the same situation and with equal experience would not omit. <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 26 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 612, 612-14 (1994) (negligence established on showing of duty, the employee's knowledge, and breach of duty of health care worker's responsibility for surgical instrument sterilization), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 69 F.3d 554 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The agency has the burden of proving a charge by preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mendez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 596, 606-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26 (2001), cited in <span class="Italic">Valez,</span> provides insight into the Board's view of negligence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Culpable negligence in the performance of official duties is a failure to exercise the degree of care required under the particular circumstances, which a person of ordinary prudence in the same situation and with equal experience would not omit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 MSPR 612, 614-16 (1994) (negligence established on showing of duty, the employee's knowledge, and breach of duty of health care worker's responsibility for surgical instrument sterilization), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 69 F.3d 554 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> Black's Law Dictionary at 1184-85 (Rev. 4th ed. 1968). The question of whether the appellants breached their duty of care turns on whether the Seized Property Handbook, under all the circumstances, established the applicable standard of care required of a person in the same situation and with the same experience as the appellants, or whether instead the applicable standard of care was established by other factors, including training, knowledge, customary agency practice, and adequacy of agency procedures. Whether the standard was breached is an objective inquiry, not based on the appellants' personal belief as to the adequacy of their performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Sinclair v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-16-0376-I-1 (NP 7/22/2022) (considering appellant's personal circumstances in using a GOV and applying an agency regulation that included negligent use of a GOV, but finding no negligence, a minor personal use of the vehicle: "his deviation from the base in the GOV was short in distance and duration, and expedited Government business"; "appellant's actions are not outside the degree of care expected of a person of ordinary prudence in the same situation with equal experience").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 110 MSPR 176, 180 &#x00B6; 9, 2008 MSPB 234 (2008), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that this analysis erroneously finds an Operational Error to be synonymous with the definition of the offense of "negligent or careless work performance that results in injury or danger of injury to others." The agency's charge of "negligent or careless work performance that results in injury or danger of injury to others," however, only required it to prove that the appellant engaged in negligent or careless work and that this negligent or careless work resulted in injury or danger to others. To prove negligence, the agency must show a failure to exercise the degree of care required under the particular circumstances, which a person of ordinary prudence in the same situation and with equal experience would not omit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mendez v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 26 (2001); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 612, 614-16 (1994) (negligence established on showing of duty, the employee's knowledge, and breach of duty of health care worker's responsibility for surgical instrument sterilization), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 69 F.3d 554 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). While the existence of an Operational Error may be probative regarding whether certain conduct constitutes negligence, the administrative judge did not identify any authority for the conclusion that the absence of an Operational Error precludes a finding of negligence, and we discern none.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care, resulting in the commission of a preventable error or mistake. It is a component of substandard performance, classified as misconduct.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, 923 F.3d 1004, 1010-15 (Fed. Cir. 2019), summarizing case law concerning negligence, discussed in the sections that follow, sustained removal of a VA manager who did not oversee a patient scheduling system with sufficient care:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that VA personnel failed to use NEAR or EWL, ultimately leading to thousands of veterans going unseen for medical care. The question here is whether Mr. Robinson was negligent in that he knew or should have known that his subordinates consistently failed to use scheduling practices required by VA policy. In short, the answer is yes. Mr. Robinson was a member of upper-level management responsible for ensuring that HAS personnel complied with the policies set forth in the Scheduling Directive. Instead, he took a hands-off approach to managing the scheduling problems at Phoenix VA despite knowing the severity of scheduling problems permeating the system. Accordingly, the Board did not err in sustaining the negligence charges against Mr. Robinson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifications 1, 2, and 4 all similarly allege that Mr. Robinson failed to properly supervise HAS personnel to ensure that NEAR and EWL were used to schedule veterans for medical appointments. Mr. Robinson contends that because he did not actually know that his subordinates were not using NEAR or EWL, he cannot be held liable for the actions of his subordinates. To the contrary, substantial evidence supports a finding that Mr. Robinson knew, or should have known, of his subordinates' failure to use NEAR and EWL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual is negligent in the performance of his duties if he fails to exercise the degree of care that "a person of ordinary prudence" with the same experience would exercise in the same situation. <span class="Italic">Velez v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 2006 M.S.P.B. 116, &#x00B6; 11 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 26 (2001)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 219 F. App'x 990 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A supervisor cannot be held responsible for the conduct of his subordinate unless he directed, knew, or should have known of the subordinate's misconduct and acquiesced to the improper behavior. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 7 M.S.P.B. 713, 714-15 (1981).[2] Factors to consider under the "knowledge and acquiescence standard" are (1) the knowledge the supervisor had, or should have had, of the subordinate's misconduct; (2) the existence of policies or practices relevant to the misconduct; and (3) the extent to which the supervisor directed or acquiesced to the subordinate's misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board may also consider the experience of the supervisor, including his length of service, as well as the number of employees under the supervisor's purview. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Not all of the factors iterated above are relevant in every case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But, in each instance, the relevant factors are weighed to discern whether the supervisor may be held responsible for the actions of his subordinates. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although <span class="Italic">Miller</span> is a non-binding Board decision, neither party has suggested that a different standard should be applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, Mr. Robinson misunderstands the charges against him. Specifications 1, 2, and 4 do not charge Robinson for "the failings of subordinates," as he contends. Rather, Mr. Robinson is charged with the failure to perform <span class="Italic">his</span> duties as Associate Director. The charge against Mr. Robinson--negligent performance of duties--implicates the behavior of his subordinates because his failure to supervise HAS personnel, among others, is at the root of each of specifications 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, we apply the <span class="Italic">Miller</span> standard to assess whether Mr. Robinson negligently performed his duties by "allowing a situation to exist in which his subordinates acted improperly." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 7 M.S.P.B. at 713.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA clearly had a policy dictating the scheduling of outpatient appointments--in this case, the Scheduling Directive. The Scheduling Directive also aimed to "ensur[e] the competency of staff directly or indirectly involved in any, or all, components of the scheduling process," and explicitly cautioned "[f]acility leadership [to] be vigilant in the identification and avoidance of inappropriate scheduling activities." As part of the "facility leadership," Mr. Robinson had a duty to ensure that his subordinates complied with the Scheduling Directive and used NEAR and EWL to schedule outpatient appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, Mr. Robinson was aware of the Scheduling Directive when it issued in 2010. He testified that the VA issued the Scheduling Directive when he was Associate Director at the Amarillo VA Medical Center.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence shows Mr. Robinson had actual knowledge of the Phoenix VA's scheduling problems during his tenure as Associate Director of Phoenix VA....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Robinson contends the evidence does not show he had knowledge of the misconduct because he asserts the <span class="Italic">Miller</span> standard requires a "robust" showing of actual knowledge. This is an incorrect reading of the rule, which <span class="Italic">considers</span>, among other factors, "the knowledge a supervisor has, <span class="Italic">or should have</span>, of the conduct of subordinates." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 7 M.S.P.B. at 714-15 (emphasis added). Therefore, when considering whether Mr. Robinson negligently performed his duties, we may consider whether a person of ordinary prudence in a similar situation should have known, or had reason to know, of his subordinates' misconduct. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Miller</span> notes that the level of knowledge required to hold a supervisor responsible for the misconduct of his employees is considered on a sliding scale depending on the level of direct control the supervisor has over the subordinates committing misconduct. 7 M.S.P.B. at 715. In other words, "the greater the duty" to control the subordinates who committed the misconduct, "the less specific knowledge of the misconduct the supervisor will be required to have." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But "[w]here it has been shown that the supervisor has direct control over the employees committing the violation, the supervisor's general knowledge of relevant factors imposes an affirmative duty to investigate further." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether Mr. Robinson had actual knowledge that employees directly responsible for scheduling were not using NEAR or EWL, Mr. Robinson had an affirmative duty to investigate in view of the emails discussed above, the VISN audit report, and the OIG interim report noting that 1,700 veterans languished on NEAR for more than thirty days. Indeed, Mr. Robinson directly supervised Bradley Curry, the Chief of HAS, whose department is responsible for scheduling veterans for outpatient appointments. Therefore, Mr. Robinson had a duty to ensure that Mr. Curry and HAS were not only using NEAR and EWL to schedule appointments, but that no unofficial methods were being used instead, i.e., a queue of screenshots to be eventually inputted into EWL. <span class="Italic">See Newton v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 85 F.3d 595, 597 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("[A]ppellant, as an experienced leader who supervised between 15 and 75 employees, was properly held to a high standard of conduct because he occupied a position of trust and authority.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It also appears that Mr. Robinson acquiesced to the scheduling improprieties permeating HAS and failed to further investigate this misconduct. A prudent supervisor with about twenty-seven years experience with the VA--at least seven of which were as an associate director--would have asked the Chief of HAS to investigate the incidents discussed in the emails and the general findings of the VISN audit and OIG interim reports. While there is some evidence in the record that Mr. Curry explored these issues, it does not appear that Mr. Robinson followed up or directed Mr. Curry and HAS to implement the policy requiring use of NEAR and EWL. The record demonstrates that as of January 3, 2014, "several open action items [were] still open and delinquent" and EWL had not been implemented in all "appropriate" outpatient centers. "Completion of these actions are required for compliance with VHA Scheduling Directive 2010-027." OIG also discovered that "Phoenix leadership did not disseminate previous communication regarding scheduling best practices to front line staff and supervisors." Mr. Robinson had a duty to follow up with Mr. Curry and HAS to ensure compliance with VA policy, but the record does not show that he did and demonstrates that he did not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the Board's decision to sustain specifications 1, 2, and 4 of Charge 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Robinson argues there is no evidence showing he ever reviewed the November 13, 2013 flowcharts. He also contends that because the VA did not introduce complete copies of these flowcharts, he is unable to dispute the claim that the flowcharts contained inaccurate information. We address each argument in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether Mr. Robinson actually reviewed the November 13, 2013 flowcharts is not material. The issue is whether the November 13 flowcharts contained inaccurate information. After examining testimony, emails, and other evidence, the Board answered that question in the affirmative. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain specifications 1 and 2, Mr. Robinson need not have actually reviewed the flowcharts. <span class="Italic">See Fairall v. Veterans Admin</span>., 844 F.2d 775, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (finding that negligent performance can include issues of "misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance"). He need only have breached a duty to ensure that the information within these flowcharts was accurate. One of Mr. Robinson's responsibilities as Associate Director, i.e., a "facility director," was to audit "timeliness and appropriateness of scheduling actions as well as the accuracy of desired dates." VISN 18 created a "collaborative action plan" to enable facilities to "to bring key aspects of the Scheduling Directive into compliance." One component <span id="Page_2849"></span>of the action plan was for scheduling supervisors to review scheduling reports daily, including the AEG683 report, and summarize these results to leadership weekly. Another action item included creating a flowchart to show "the facility process from appointment creation to outcomes metrics." Mr. Robinson and other Phoenix VA directors were charged with providing monthly, then weekly, updates on Phoenix VA's progress. Mr. Robinson recognized it was "important that we accurately reflect" the scheduling processes at Phoenix VA and stated he "would have expected to review" the flowcharts. Ms. Bowers, VISN 18's Director, asked Mr. Robinson to be involved in the creation of the flowcharts. Thus, the flowcharts fell within the purview of Mr. Robinson's job responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that Mr. Robinson neglected his duty to ensure that the flowchart information submitted to VISN 18 was accurate. A reasonable, prudent Associate Director would have ensured that the flowcharts contained accurate information before transmitting them to VISN 18. Specifications 1 and 2 alleged that the November 13, 2013 flowcharts reflected that the (1) AEG683 reports were run daily and that (2) Phoenix VA schedulers were using NEAR and EWL. But this information was not accurate. A December 2013 email from Mr. Curry shows that "[t]he AEG 683 Report has not been reproduced routinely for approximately 4 months." In fact, the report had not been run "consistently" since July 2013. As discussed above, Phoenix VA schedulers were not using NEAR and EWL to make patient appointments. Section A, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the Board's decision to sustain specifications 1 and 2.</p>
