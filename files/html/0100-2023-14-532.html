<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-533"><span class="space">2.</span> Availability and Use of Government Vehicles</h4>
<p class="noindent">Decisions as to the appropriate mode of transportation are discretionary on the part of agency management. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 9 FLRA 253, 257 (1982) (concerning agency-established practice permitting employees to choose between private and government vehicles on extended details). Government regulations require that determination to be made on a case-by-case basis rather than through uniform rules. <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 727 F.2d 481, 490 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that the agency request sufficient cars from GSA for use of employees required to travel infringed on the means of accomplishing work and excessively interfered with the right to determine those means. It negated the right of the agency to determine how its mission would be accomplished. The same was true as to a proposal calling on the agency to allocate government cars on the basis of employee hardship. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 26 and IRS, Atlanta Dist.</span>, 22 FLRA 314, 318-322 (1986) (Proposals 2 and 3). Another proposal was beyond the scope of bargaining that precluded the agency from requiring employees to use private vehicles for government work. The choice of a particular mode of transportation to accomplish the agency mission was a means for the accomplishment of agency work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2052 and Dept. of Interior, BLM, Boise Dist. Office</span>, 30 FLRA 797, 831 (1987) (Proposal 20). The result was different for overseas teachers: they could negotiate on a proposal requiring the availability of military transportation to attend to personal emergencies. The availability of adequate transportation was an inducement for employees to accept jobs overseas, making the transportation an employment condition. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 27 FLRA 492, 517 (1987) (Proposal 17). Determined to be a negotiable arrangement in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals and Dept. of Labor</span>, 58 FLRA 616 (2003), was a proposal that delayed for an assessment period of a year a decision on whether to reduce the number of GSA vehicles available for employees at a regional office. The benefit to employees was a reduction in the number of occasions employees would be required to make alternative arrangements for rental cars. That benefit outweighed the intrusion on the agency's ability to determine the means of performing its work.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R12-33 and Dept. of Navy, Pac. Missile Test Ctr., Point Mugu</span>, 40 FLRA 479, 490 (1991), rejected as nonnegotiable a proposal that allowed police officers in a duty status for an entire eight-hour shift to use GOVs to obtain their meals if the use was incidental to their patrol duties:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, in agreement with the Agency, that the circumstances of this case do not establish that the use of Government vehicles would be for official purposes within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the existing 8 and 1/2 hour tour of duty, employees are in a nonpaid status during a 30-minute meal period. The Union states that during the meal period, "[g]enerally, security personnel eat in the trailer, behind the security office, provided by the Employer."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of the proposal would authorize the use of Government vehicles whenever the use is incidental to patrol duties.&#x2003;The Union, however, has not defined what is meant by "incidental to patrol duties" or who would make such determinations. In our view, the proposal would allow employees to use Government vehicles on a daily basis when, in the employees' view, such use is incidental to their duties. The proposal is not limited to situations where employees are using their vehicles while engaged in the performance of duties when the meal period arises. In such a situation, it might be both advantageous to the Agency and sensible to the employee to allow that employee to remain in the vehicle for the purpose of eating or to obtain lunch at what may be a nearby food service facility. We find little support for the Union's assertion that employees work during their meal periods and, therefore, the use of vehicles would be for official purposes. It is not apparent to us that employees would be able to respond to emergencies, for example, if they were out of their vehicles obtaining lunch, or that employees would be able to complete paper work while travelling to obtain lunch.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that as the fourth and fifth sentences of the proposal would require the Agency to allow employees to use Government vehicles for other than official purposes, this portion of the proposal is inconsistent with 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344....</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable as an arrangement was Provision 1 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1513 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island</span>, 41 FLRA 589, 591, 595-97 (1991), that "[d]uring overtime assignments when employees were not aware of the length of the job assignments so that they could provide their own food, the Employer, when requested, will provide transportation or dispatch an individual to obtain food for the employees, at the employees' expense":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that this portion of the provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's assignment of overtime. We also conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that this portion of the provision does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the provision does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's right, we note that the provision applies only when employees are unaware of the duration of an overtime assignment and, therefore, are unable to take measures to provide their own meals. In this regard, it is uncontroverted that employees may be called on to work long hours and in areas that do not have food service readily available. Under such circumstances, dispatching an individual to procure food items, at the employees' expense, so that employees do not miss meals, clearly relates to the health and well-being of the employees. Employees who are required to stay on the job for unknown periods of time without adequate nourishment may suffer ill effects and reduced productivity. The ability of employees to perform their assigned tasks under such circumstances could be seriously impaired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the effect on the Agency's right to assign work, on balance, would be less significant. While the Agency would be required to dispatch an individual for the purpose of obtaining food, the Agency would maintain the discretion to determine which individual to dispatch. Also, we find that when faced with requests to dispatch an individual, the Agency would be able to determine when, during the overtime assignment, to dispatch the individual. Nothing in the provision requires the individual to be dispatched immediately, on the employee's request, rather than when the Agency deems the dispatched individual to be available to perform the task. In addition, disruption could be minimized by having the Agency solicit food orders when a request is first made or otherwise determining when the dispatched individual will actually obtain the food items. Moreover, the fact that the practice of dispatching an individual for this purpose has been in existence, as the Union states, suggests, in the absence of any arguments by the Agency to the contrary, that the requirements of Provision 1 would not significantly affect management's ability to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an alternative to dispatching an individual to obtain food, Provision 1 <span id="page_1018"></span>also states that the Agency will provide transportation, when requested, to enable employees to obtain food during overtime assignments. Contrary to the Agency's assertion, we find that this portion of the provision is consistent with 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344 governs the use of passenger carriers owned by the Government and prescribes the circumstances under which funds may be expended for the operation, maintenance and repair of passenger vehicles that are used for "official purposes." As noted, the Agency contends that the use of Government vehicles for obtaining food for employees assigned to overtime in the circumstances of this case is not for an official purpose and, therefore, the provision is inconsistent with 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, we addressed a proposal involving the use by employees of Government vehicles to obtain food and in which to eat meals. In <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R12-33 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, California</span>, 40 FLRA 479 (1991) (Pacific Missile Test Center), we found that such use did not constitute an official purpose in the circumstances presented. However, we also indicated that there are situations in which the use of a Government vehicle can be authorized under 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344. We noted, by way of example, that the use of Government vehicles may be authorized when employees are unexpectedly detained at the work site or work in remote locations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, based on the language of the provision and the Union's stated intent, we find that the use of Government vehicles is consistent with "official purposes" within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344. This portion of the provision would allow the use of Government vehicles for the purpose of obtaining food only when employees are unaware of the duration of an overtime assignment and could not otherwise provide their own meals. Because the employees would be detained at the Agency's facility, performing duties that are assigned to them on an overtime basis, and in areas that are remote from food service facilities, we conclude that the use of Government vehicles would be for "official purposes" within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that Provision 1 does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute and does not conflict with 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344. Accordingly, we conclude that Provision 1 is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable were proposals that the agency maintain several electric motor scooters to facilitate transportation by employees of agency publications within an enclosed building. One proposal required availability of the scooters to all employees; the other required availability of the scooters to disabled employees. The agency did not demonstrate that they interfered with the agency's choice of performing the same work through use of tricycles, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 and Dept. of Army, Army Publications Distrib. Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 47 FLRA 931, 934-36 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 requires the Agency to properly maintain a minimum of three electric scooters for use by maintenance employees.&#x2003;Proposal 2 requires the Agency to continue to make electric scooters available to maintenance employees who, by appropriate statements or medical documentation, demonstrate that they suffer from physical hardship or a handicapping condition. We find that the proposals are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right, under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, to determine the methods and means of performing work. In order to sustain such a claim, an agency must show that: (1) a direct and integral relationship exists between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first part of the test, it is clear from the record that the electric scooters referenced in the proposals would be used by maintenance employees to travel throughout the building in the performance of their duties. Specifically, the Agency states, and the Union does not dispute, that the manually operated tricycles will be used, as were the electric scooters, "to travel to sites in the building to conduct inspections or spot repairs of the equipment and to carry their tools and minor items of repair to the sites of mechanical/electrical breakdown."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we find that the Agency has demonstrated a direct and integral relationship between the mode of transportation used by maintenance employees and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission. Specifically, we find that the mission of the Agency facility involved in this case is to store and distribute various Agency publications. The Agency uses mechanical and electrical systems to accomplish its storage and distribution functions and employs maintenance personnel to service those systems. As noted above, those maintenance personnel formerly used electric scooters to travel to building sites to conduct inspections or spot repairs of the equipment and to carry their tools and minor repair items to sites of mechanical or electrical breakdowns. Further, it is clear that the Agency has decided to replace the electric scooters with manually operated tricycles that will be used by maintenance personnel in the performance of their duties. Consequently, we find that the Agency has demonstrated that a direct and integral relationship exists between the mode of transportation used by maintenance employees and the accomplishment of the mission of the Agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as to the second part of the two-part test, the Agency has not identified the mission-related purposes it sought to achieve in replacing the electric scooters with manually operated tricycles for transporting maintenance workers in the performance of their duties. Moreover, it is not apparent from the record how requiring the Agency to maintain a minimum of three electric scooters for use by maintenance employees in the performance of their duties would directly interfere with the purposes for which the Agency decided to replace the electric scooters with manually operated tricycles....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that, by requiring the Agency to maintain a minimum of three electric scooters, the proposals directly interfere with management's right to determine the means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. We find, therefore, that the proposals do not directly interfere with management's determination of the means of performing the Agency's work. In making this finding, we do not decide whether, in a case with a different record, a proposal requiring an agency to use a particular mode of transportation would directly interfere with the mission-related purposes for which the agency adopted some other mode of transportation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that Proposal 1 violates management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute by requiring that employees be assigned to maintain the scooters. However, Proposal 1 only requires that the Agency maintain a minimum of three electric scooters. The proposal does not address the assignment of work. The proposal does not, for example, require the Agency to assign any particular work to employees. We have previously held that to conclude that a proposal or provision interferes with management's right to assign work simply because it requires an agency to take some action would completely nullify the obligation to bargain because no obligation of any kind could be placed on management through negotiations....</p>
