<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-37"><span class="space">a.</span> "Reasonably Believes"; False Statement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amended 5 USC 2302(b) to more clearly define what is meant by the phrase "any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences" a protected disclosure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of paragraph (8)...(ii) a determination as to whether an employee or applicant reasonably believes that such employee or applicant has disclosed information that evidences any violation of law, rule, regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety shall be made by determining whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee or applicant could reasonably conclude that the actions of the Government evidence such violations, mismanagement, waste, abuse, or danger.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The WPEA also added to 5 USC 2302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; of the employee's or applicant's motive for making the disclosure[.]</p>

[Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-20-121.html#sec13-117">Retroactivity</a>," for <span class="Italic">Day</span>.]</p>

<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A) extends protection to individuals who reasonably believe that their disclosures encompass the statutorily described conditions. The personal motives of the whistleblower are immaterial.

VA</span>, 80 MSPR 248, 251 &#x00B6; 9 (1998) (as to a disclosure motivated by a poor relationship with the object of the disclosure: "Appellant's motive for making a disclosure...is irrelevant in determining whether the disclosure was protected."); <span class="Italic">Bump v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 69 MSPR 354, 358 (1996) ("The WPA makes no provision for considering whether the employee's personal motivation rendered his belief not genuine."), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Pashun v.

MSPB,</span> 880 F.3d 913 (7th Cir. 2018)], the relevant language of the Act does not require a disclosure to assert a violation of law as definitively as the Board had required of Delgado. The Act protects a disclosure that the employee "reasonably believes evidences" a violation of the law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Our decision squarely rejected the Board's rationale for finding that Delgado's disclosure was not protected. Under paragraph (b)(8), a whistleblower need not assert that he has definitive proof of a violation of law, such that he is confident that all innocent explanations can be refuted. 880 F.3d at 922.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the federal Act, whistleblowers are protected even if their disclosures fall short of a complete investigative report that leaves no room for disagreement or rebuttal. They are protected even if a more complete investigation or hearing ultimately shows that their suspicions were not correct. The Act leaves federal managers and supervisors with the power and responsibility to choose whether to investigate and ultimately to decide whether reported suspicions were correct. What the Act prohibits is retaliation--punishment--for employees who speak up about their reasonable suspicions of wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After all, managers in federal agencies are supposed to react to and investigate relevant information about their agencies even if--especially if--important facts are not yet known. The Office of Special Counsel itself is supposed to be in the business of conducting investigations. It should not merely wait for intrepid employees to conduct their own investigations, to prepare complete and definitive investigative reports, delivered to the Office tied up in ribbons....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the substance of Dr. Hessami's allegations could not amount to misconduct, the Board assumed, based on the testimony of agency witnesses as cited in the opinion, that Dr. Nichols's prescribing choices were clinically justified, and that this should have been known to Dr. Hessami. That assumption was impermissible at the stage of the proceedings, where the question is the sufficiency of Dr. Hessami's allegations to invoke the Board's jurisdiction. Regardless of whether the agency may ultimately prove on the merits that Dr. Nichols's prescribing decisions were discernibly reasonable, Dr. Hessami has adequately alleged a reasonable belief that they were not. The issue should therefore be resolved at a hearing.</p>

Nonetheless, the administrative judge's error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights because the appellant has not nonfrivolously alleged that he reasonably believed that in disclosing to the IG that Ms. Jefferson threatened to terminate him, he was disclosing a violation of law, rule, or regulation or one of the other conditions set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Usharauli</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">Karapinka v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reasonableness of disclosures claimed to be protected may devolve to analysis of the plausibility of the assertions, and that examination will consider the content and context of the disclosures, as in <span class="Italic">Aubart v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220118123">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), involving an employee's complaints as to the accuracy or truthfulness of information pertaining to a duty station change:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Aubart argues on appeal that the Board's decision "failed to properly apply the non-frivolous standard at the jurisdictional stage." We disagree. A nonfrivolous allegation "is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue" under the WPA requirements; it must be plausible on its face and more than conclusory. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s); <span class="Italic">see Hessami</span>, 979 F.3d at 1367-69; <span class="Italic">Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371-72. As a result, the key question here is whether Mr. Aubart <span class="Italic">plausibly</span> alleged (after the Hawaii district court ruling) that a disinterested observer, privy to all essential facts known and readily ascertainable to Mr. Aubart, would reasonably conclude that Ms. Orejana, Lt. Col. Siegrist, and Deputy Director Chilson "knowingly and willfully" made "materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement[s] or representation[s]" in matters "within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of Government of the United States." 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1001(a); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., United States v. Litvak</span>, 808 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir. 2015). We agree with the Board that Mr. Aubart did not (and could not) plausibly allege that any disinterested observer, even a layperson, would reasonably believe that the named individuals violated &#x00A7; 1001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, no such reasonable belief is possible regarding Ms. Orejana and Lt. Col. Siegrist's statements in their CBCA submissions that the Siegrist Memorandum notified RCC-P employees that their "official duty station" had been changed--even though the Siegrist Memorandum did not itself use the term "official duty station" and did repeatedly use the word "temporary." The district court in Mr. Aubart's Hawaii litigation explained why the Siegrist Memorandum, properly read, treated Mr. Aubart's permanent duty station as changed, given the technical definitions set forth in the applicable law and regulations. <span class="Italic">Aubart</span>, 2019 WL 3892408, at *5-6. As a result, no disinterested observer, aware of the district court litigation as Mr. Aubart certainly was (when he made the asserted whistleblowing disclosures), could reasonably believe that Ms. Orejana and Lt. Col. Siegrist's statements making essentially the same legal arguments that the district court ratified had knowingly and willfully made materially false statements in violation of &#x00A7; 1001(a). See id. (using "official duty station" and "permanent duty station" interchangeably); Informal Reply Br. 3 (Mr. Aubart recognizing that "permanent duty station" is synonymous with "official station").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, no disinterested observer could reasonably believe that Deputy Directory Chilson violated &#x00A7; 1001 by stating in his July 2019 declaration in district court that Lt. Col. Siegrist informed the RCC-P employees that their "duty station was being moved...because the office at Fort Shafter was no longer available." For the same reasons described above, there is no possible plausible allegation that anyone could view the first half of Deputy Directory Chilson's statement (i.e., that the duty station was moved) as materially false. Further, there is no possible plausible allegation that anyone could view the second half of the statement (i.e., that Fort Shafter was no longer available) as materially false simply because Deputy Directory Chilson did not additionally spell out the precise way (not available for regular work, but available for storage, etc.) or reason (for renovation) that Fort Shafter was no longer available.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, "[t]he statute does not contain a requirement that a disclosure be made with such specificity as to enable the recipient of the disclosure to conduct an investigation without having to return to the employee for additional information." <span class="Italic">Keefer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The "whistleblower" protection set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) affords relief to those against whom reprisals have been taken for the disclosure of information the employee or applicant "reasonably believes evidences" the conditions set forth. Although the employee must establish his defense of reprisal, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(2)], he need not establish that the condition he reports <span class="Italic">demonstrates</span> mismanagement, danger, or any of the situations set forth in the statute; he must only show that the reported condition was one which he reasonably believed to constitute one of the situations specified.[1] Such a showing may be made, of course, by establishing that mismanagement or danger existed and that such condition was known to and reported by the employee. The presiding official in this case, however, was incorrect in assuming that proof on appellant's part short of an actual demonstration of mismanagement or a dangerous condition could not be sufficient to meet the appellant's statutory burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The original version of S. 2640, the Senate Bill which was to become the Civil Service Reform Act, protected the employee against reprisals taken by virtue of public disclosure of a violation of law, rule, or regulation so long as the disclosure itself was not violative of law, rule, or regulation. The Committee on Governmental Affairs specifically broadened the whistleblower protection by including, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> more categories of disclosures which were protected and by making the standard the employee's "reasonable belief" that the information disclosed represents one of the categories specified. With reference to public health or safety related disclosures, the Committee specifically expressed its intent that the protection extended only to disclosures of dangers which were both "substantial and specific." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 21. The "reasonable belief" standard is also applied to the private sector reporting of suspected violation of EEO laws and reprisals taken against the employee for such disclosures. <span class="Italic">Berg v. LaCrosse Cooler Co.,</span> 612 F.2d 1041 (7th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the employee who alleges reprisal for "whistleblowing" as a defense to an adverse action in an appeal to this Board need not establish with certainty the mismanagement or danger arising from agency actions, as this may well be extremely difficult for an employee to do, the employee must come forth with such proof, either in the form of testimony or documentary evidence, as will establish that the matter reported was one which a reasonable person in the employee's position would believe to evidence mismanagement, danger, or any of the situations specified in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>

Therefore, the appellant's failure to prove that the alleged misconduct described in her disclosures occurred is not a valid basis for finding that those disclosures are not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing first Mr. Pedeleose's disclosure to the IG relating to Ms. VanDerbeck, we hold that substantial evidence supports the Board's decision that this was not a protected disclosure. In order to establish a protected disclosure, the whistleblower must have a reasonable belief that a law, rule, or regulation has been violated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381 (requiring consideration of whether a "disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee" would reasonably conclude that a violation occurred); <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 283 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (requiring "that the whistleblower had a reasonable belief that, for example, a rule or regulation had been violated"). Mr. Pedeleose's belief that a violation occurred--namely, that Ms. VanDerbeck was targeted for termination because of her whistleblowing about safety issues--was not reasonable, however. Rather, it was his purely subjective perspective, which he was even told was misguided. <span class="Italic">See Lachance</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381 ("A purely subjective perspective of an employee is not sufficient even if shared by other employees.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, Mr. Pedeleose learned of Ms. VanDerbeck's potential termination from a former DCMA employee, DeAngeles Davis. Ms. Davis did not learn of this information directly, but instead learned of it from another employee, Ms. Shelton-Thomas. Ms. Shelton-Thomas, in turn, merely heard about a meeting attended by Colonel Plourde and other employees where Ms. VanDerbeck's termination was allegedly discussed. Thus, the record evidence demonstrates that this information was nothing more than highly attenuated gossip. More significantly, Ms. Davis not only told Mr. Pedeleose about this entire "chain" of gossip, but also that any discussion of terminating Ms. VanDerbeck was due to her inappropriate conduct affecting DCMA's relationship with LMM employees, not due to her whistleblowing. In sum, there is substantial evidence that Mr. Pedeleose knew this information was highly suspect and that he was explicitly told that Ms. VanDerbeck's potential termination was not because of whistleblowing. Mr. Pedeleose's belief to the contrary was therefore not reasonable and, thus, the Board was correct to find that he did not make a protected disclosure concerning Ms. VanDerbeck's potential termination.</p>

Regarding this disclosure, which the appellant raised in response to the jurisdictional order, we note that the reasonable belief test relates to the content of the disclosure, not the manner in which it is expressed. The question to be decided is whether a disinterested person in the appellant's position could have reasonably concluded that the actions of the agency, i.e., the search of an office and seizure of certain property, evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Lachance v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure when he disclosed the alleged violation of a DOD regulation in the January 12, 2002 newspaper article. Before OSC, the appellant claimed that DOD Directive 2000.12 required that the agency train the depot's SRT in an Army course and that training the depot's SRT at the DOE violated this directive. Below, the appellant also claimed that the depot's SRT training violated the following regulations and instruction that purportedly restricted the source of the depot's SRT training to the Army's course offered at the U.S. Army Military Police School (USAMPS), Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri: Army Regulation 190-58; DOD Instruction <span id="Page_3689"></span>2000.14; Army Material Command Regulation 525-13; and U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 525-13.

We find it most efficient in this case to proceed directly to the issue of whether the appellant made a protected whistleblowing disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant failed to prove by preponderant evidence that he made a protected whistleblowing disclosure. In order to show entitlement to protection as a whistleblower, an appellant must establish that he disclosed information which he reasonably believed evidenced a situation set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), e.g., a violation of law, rule, or regulation or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i),(ii). To establish that a belief was reasonable, an appellant need not prove that the matter disclosed actually established any of the situations set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); rather he must show that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable to the appellant could reasonably conclude that the disclosure evidenced wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101 &#x00B6; 23 (2004).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of DOD Directive 2000.12, Army Regulation 190-58, DOD Instruction 2000.14, Army Material Command Regulation 525-13, and TRADOC Regulation 525-13 is not sufficient to show that the agency's action in training the depot's SRT at the DOE, rather than USAMPS, could reasonably be interpreted as a violation of these authorities. None of these authorities requires that the depot use USAMPS or any other Army training course to train its SRT. The only regulation, directive, or instruction identified that restricts the source of SRT training is TRADOC Regulation 525-13. TRADOC Regulation 525-13. This regulation states, in chapter 9 at 9-1, that personnel assigned to the SRT will satisfactorily complete training at "Special Reaction Team Training Course (Phase I) (7H-F17/830-F-12)." However, the TRADOC Regulations apply only to TRADOC subcommands, installations, and activities. "Applicability" section. The agency submitted a copy of an official Army webpage listing the 16 Army TRADOC installations (<a href="http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tradoc/install.htm">www.tradoc.army.mil/tradoc/install.htm</a>). The depot is not included on this list. Thus, TRADOC Regulation 525-13 does not restrict the source of the depot's SRT training. Army Regulation 190-58, which is applicable to the depot's SRT, also does not restrict the source of SRT training. Army Regulation 190-58, chapters 4-1, 4-2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant has not shown that he relied on anything other than the language of the authorities above in reaching his apparent conclusion that the agency had violated these authorities. He has not alleged nor shown that he made any inquiries or sought advice from supervisors or anyone else through agency channels concerning whether USAMPS training was required for the depot's SRT or whether the depot had obtained approval for the DOE training. Instead, he reported to the newspaper reporter his unsubstantiated belief that the SRT's training violated a DOD regulation and was unauthorized based solely on his experience as a Security Guard, his SRT training at USAMPS in 2000 (USAMPS diploma), and his misguided interpretation of agency regulations, directive, and instruction. Moreover, there is no evidence that the propriety of the DOE training course was the subject of an investigation, or that the agency took any other action in this regard, after the appellant made his disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under all of these circumstances, we find that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could not have reasonably concluded that the depot violated an agency law, rule, or regulation when it selected a DOE training course to train its SRT. <span class="Italic">See Giove v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In January 2001, the appellant was interviewed as part of an investigation by the agency's Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The agency had contracted through the Department of the Navy with a software subcontractor to work on a Joint Application Development (JAD) project to design software for all of RMA's divisions to use, and, during the interview with the OIG, the appellant related her difficulties with the subcontractor. Five of the subcontractor's developers had been released by Denise Hoffman, who was the chief of RMA's actuarial division and the contract officer responsible for the JAD project, to help the appellant's fiscal operations division maintain and develop their information systems. The appellant contended that the subcontractor's employees had refused to communicate with the fiscal division's technicians, which made the appellant's job of managing and maintaining the systems impossible, and that the way that the subcontractor's employees had developed the system and then kept the details to themselves had increased the division's workload. The appellant alleged that she had reported these problems to Ms. Hoffman because her actuarial division, not the appellant's fiscal division, held the contract with the subcontractor, but there was never any improvement... The Navy had subsequently decided to stop using the subcontractor due to problems similar to those the appellant had reported, and the appellant tried to relay this information to Ms. Hoffman, but the actuarial division subsequently arranged to contract with the same subcontractor directly. The fiscal division maintained the original Navy contract because the appellant believed that the risk was too great to continue with the subcontractor. The appellant had similar problems with this subcontractor on another system, and, when she got permission to rewrite the fiscal division's systems, she did not let the subcontractor participate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her OIG interview, the appellant attributed part of the problem to the <span id="Page_3690"></span>structure of the contract; each division had selected their contracting officer's technical representative (COTR) from different roles, the actuarial division's COTR was Ms. Hoffman, who was a manager, and the COTR for the fiscal operations division was the appellant, who was a technician. The COTR was responsible for accepting the deliverables, i.e., the product that had been contracted for, and the COTR's acceptance authorized payment to the subcontractor. Due to the contract structure, the fiscal division had no direct control over the subcontractor, and the appellant contended that the subcontractor "behaved as if they had no responsibility" to her division. The appellant alleged that Ms. Hoffman had pressured her to sign invoices on the contract which the appellant felt were incorrect and perhaps fraudulent. The appellant refused to sign the invoices, however, because her division was not responsible for the contract and the subcontractor had not done any work for her because she had not allowed the subcontractor to participate in the rewrite of the fiscal division's systems. The appellant alleged that the subcontractor had too much control, delivered a questionable work product, and kept knowledge of the systems to itself in order to remain essential to the agency. Four months later, in April 2001, the appellant was detailed from her supervisory computer specialist position to a non-supervisory computer specialist position at the same grade level, and permanently reassigned to that position in June 2002; Ms. Hoffman initiated both the appellant's detail and her subsequent reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, regardless of any concessions by the agency, "[t]he question of whether a disclosure is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is a matter of mixed fact and law and stipulations relating to such matters are not binding." <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 17 n.4 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 628, 634 (1996)). A disclosure made by the appellant in her OIG interview would be protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(B) only if she reasonably believed that the information she disclosed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that her disclosures revealed misconduct prohibited under the WPA, is this: Could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence wrongdoing as defined by the WPA? <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 528 U.S. 1153 (2000). In making a disclosure involving a violation of law, rule, or regulation, it is not necessary that the disclosure specify a particular kind of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach; the inquiry into whether a disclosure is protected ends upon a determination that the appellant disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32, 36, &#x00B6; 11 (2000). However, the appellant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that she reasonably believed that the information she disclosed to the OIG evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also reflects that the appellant has not established that she reasonably believed her disclosure evidenced gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(B)(ii). Gross mismanagement is "a management action or inaction which creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission." <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 11 (2005). It is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An examination of the OIG's memo of conversation recounting the appellant's interview reflects that, in her view, the subcontractor was not delivering the product required by her division. As a result, she refused to sign for the deliverables and thereafter utilized a different contractor to accomplish the work of her division. It is apparent that the appellant was unhappy with the subcontractor hired by the agency and advised Hoffman of the problems she was encountering. However, she has offered no evidence to show how the subcontractor's performance adversely impacted the agency's ability to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gross waste of funds constitutes a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government, <span class="Italic">Van Ee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 693, 698 (1994), and the record is insufficient to establish that the appellant had a reasonable belief that this level of waste occurred. Although the appellant made clear to the OIG in her interview that she thought that the deliverables that Ms. Hoffman had insisted that the appellant accept were, in her opinion, not acceptable, there is no indication in the record of the scale of the expenditure involved or what, if any, funds were either involved in the project or would have been required to satisfy the appellant's concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor did the appellant establish that she reasonably believed that Ms. Hoffman abused her authority. An abuse of authority occurs when there is an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons. <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 236, 241, &#x00B6; 13 (2001). Mr. O'Connor stated that the appellant alleged that she had been pressured by Ms. Hoffman to sign invoices that she felt were incorrect and perhaps fraudulent. Had Ms. Hoffman, in her role as a supervisor, actually prevailed on the appellant to sign for the deliverables despite the appellant's conviction that those deliverables were not acceptable, a disinterested observer might reasonably conclude that Ms. Hoffman's order was an arbitrary and capricious exercise of her power that adversely affected the appellant's rights as the COTR. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wheeler</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 13. However, the record establishes that Ms. Hoffman did not prevail on the appellant to sign for the deliverables, because Ms. Hoffman signed for them herself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although Ms. Hoffman's signature itself might be considered an exercise of her power, the record does not establish that the appellant reasonably believed that this disclosure evidenced an abuse of Ms. Hoffman's authority. Finally, the appellant has not established that she reasonably believed that the information she disclosed to the OIG evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Therefore, because the appellant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she made disclosures that she reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), the appellant's request for corrective action is denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"An appellant's statements regarding his alleged protected disclosures can be so deficient on their face that the Board will find that they fail to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a reasonable belief, meaning that the Board will dismiss the IRA case for lack of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Huffman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[D]isclosure of illegal conduct requires identifying a specific law, rule or regulation that was violated, not merely asserting one's belief that a statute was erroneously interpreted. <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, 234 F.3d at 13-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Experience is a key factor to consider when determining the reasonableness of one's belief. <span class="Italic">See Haley v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 977 F.2d 553, 556-58 (Fed. Cir. 1992). An employee who knows that a regulation allows broad discretion, cannot reasonably believe that exercise of such discretion is a violation of the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 557.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Other employees' agreement with Mr. Coppens that the travel policy was unreasonable is irrelevant because the test for "reasonable belief" is not subjective. Mr. Coppens's experience as an auditor and his research on the issue of the travel policy are evidence that Mr. Coppens knew the off-duty travel policy was discretionary. Because he knew this, Mr. Coppens could not have reasonably believed it was a violation of the regulation. At most, he believed it was an erroneous interpretation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Credibility may be a factor in assessing the reasonableness of disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 397, 403 (1994) ("[O]ur review of the record fails to indicate any basis for the assertions of government wrongdoing, especially where the administrative judge properly found the appellant's testimony to be wholly incredible under <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987)."). But the AJ is not to make credibility determinations based on agency evidence to determine, as a matter of jurisdiction, that the appellant failed to make out a nonfrivolous allegation of reprisal sufficient to carry the case to a merits hearing, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> 101 MSPR 6, 10-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her disclosures were protected because she failed to show that she had a reasonable belief that her disclosures evidenced either an abuse of authority or a violation of law, rule, or regulation. In reaching this conclusion, the AJ weighed the appellant's version of events against a statement provided by one of the agency's witnesses and determined that the appellant, in essence, was not credible. The AJ found that the appellant's disclosures were based on a purely subjective belief and there was no evidence that any similarly situated employees viewed the incident with Mr. Roberts the way that the appellant did. The AJ noted <span id="Page_3691"></span>that there was no evidence that the IG believed that the appellant's allegations were substantial enough to do an investigation or that the incident with Mr. Roberts created a significant adverse impact on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. The AJ also found, "[i]n sum, I find the appellant's proof on this issue to be inherently unreliable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">in determining whether the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling her to a hearing, the AJ may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Woodworth v.

<p class="Body-Text">Whether an appellant's disclosures constitute protected whistleblowing is a matter of law. Notwithstanding the parties' stipulation that an appellant made protected disclosures, the Board must still resolve, for example, whether the appellant had a reasonable belief that a condition he reported established a substantial and specific threat to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 628, 634, 640 (1996) (agency actions to remedy the appellant's safety concerns bolstered the conclusion that those concerns were based on a reasonable belief)<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Charest v. FEMA</span>, 54 MSPR 436, 438 (1992) ("The administrative judge found that the agency stipulated that the appellant's reports of perceived security and leave violations constituted protected disclosures.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant cannot establish that the reported condition established a situation described at 5 USC 2302(b)(8), the appellant must establish that the matter reported was one that a reasonable person in his position would have believed constituted one of the situations specified at 5 USC 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 337, 342 (1995) (concerning the alleged violation of agency rules governing inmate disciplinary proceedings); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Schlosser v.

<p class="Body-Text">A prohibited personnel practice is made out if reprisal is taken against an individual who complains of what he reasonably believes is a violation of agency regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hupka v. DOD</span>, 74 MSPR 406, 410 (1997) (employee, who was not a lawyer, reasonably believed the agency violated the Privacy Act and made disclosures of those suspected violations to a congressional office); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR 614, 628 (1991) (employee reported the violation of agency smoking regulations). The disclosure is not stripped of protection because it is voiced by the appellant "as a private citizen," nor does context seem to matter, e.g., a disclosure could be protected even if it was made in a settlement discussion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Van Ee v. EPA</span>, 64 MSPR 693, 696 (1994). But "[m]ere opinion cannot constitute a protected disclosure that supports a whistleblower claim." <span class="Italic">Allgood v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3390) ("[O]pinions...do not amount to a protected disclosure because they do not reveal, expose, or make known any facts or information.... Section 2302(b)(8)(A) requires a disclosure of <span class="Italic">information</span> by an employee or applicant....").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cases based on rumor, speculation, and unfounded opinions aside, to establish a defense of reprisal it is not necessary for the employee to show that the condition he reported demonstrated mismanagement or danger; he need only show that the condition was one that he reasonably believed to constitute one of the conditions covered by the statute. If the condition is actually demonstrated, that is sufficient, but it is not necessary. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. FAA</span>, 4 MSPR 388, 392, 4 MSPB 446 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 237 (1995) ("The test for whether the appellant had a reasonable belief that his disclosure evidenced a violation of agency regulation is an objective one, and an actual regulatory violation does not need to be proved."). Under <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 370, 376 n.5 (1994), the truth of a protected disclosure is of marginal importance in the analysis of a reprisal claim. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Chianelli v. EPA</span>, 86 MSPR 651, 657-58 &#x00B6; 15 (2000) ("The OIG's audit of the pesticide program of South Dakota, another state in region 8, also undercuts the appellant's allegation that he made a protected disclosure when he asserted in his October 1, 1996 memorandum that the agency had misspent 35 million dollars in funding region 8 state programs and had virtually nothing to show for it.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Opinion evidence is relevant to the reasonable belief test, but it is of little value unless the basis for the opinion is stated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 658 n.10 (1997). Rumors alone will not likely form the basis of a reasonable belief in prohibited conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 92 MSPR 429, 433-34 &#x00B6; 10 (2002) ("[A]n appellant does not satisfy the reasonable belief requirement if he is merely reporting unsubstantiated rumors."). <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 655-56 (1997), noted of a case involving an allegation of preferential treatment between a male supervisor and female subordinate as to whom gossip imputed a romantic relationship:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is no indication whether the IG considered the possibility that the rumors might be malicious fabrications by the network of disgruntled DOC employees found by the ALJ. In our view, such an unfounded "perception" falls far short of a reasonable basis to believe that an improper purpose to confer a benefit on Bloch motivated the respondent's work relationship with her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as noted above, the allegations of preferential treatment in the anonymous letter did not mention work assignments or respondent's reliance on Bloch but rather cited his sending flowers with a performance award and presenting Bloch an award in private. We agree with the ALJ that such actions are too trivial for a reasonable person to believe that they evidence abuse of supervisory authority by the respondent within the meaning of section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Cf. Frederick v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 73 F.3d 349, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (purported whistleblower could not have had a reasonable belief that supervisor's trivial infraction was a violation of law within the meaning of section 2302(b)(8)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the record shows that the respondent sent Bloch flowers when presenting her an award for the successful completion of an unusually protracted, difficult, and important negotiation, which avoided a potentially large liability for the government. Thus, even if the allegation that flowers were sent would otherwise qualify as a protected disclosure, this factual context would likely have been known to employees of the DOC. Under the circumstances, it would be difficult to show that the letter writer had a reasonable belief that the respondent's actions evidenced improper preferential treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nafus v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 386, 398 (1993), added as to the factual basis for a disclosure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There may be cases where an appellant's failure to go through agency channels to <span class="Italic">secure additional information</span> would detract from or even be fatal to the claim that he reasonably believed some fact. These would be cases in which the appellant acted on information so obviously incomplete or sketchy that a reasonable person would not have relied on it alone.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reliance on the informed advice of others may demonstrate the reasonableness of disclosures, <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Dept. of Army</span>, 116 MSPR 525, 528 &#x00B6; 7, 2011 MSPB 71 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, the appellant had obtained an opinion from the legal department stating that allowing the event to proceed (with videotaping and photography) would violate agency ethical regulations and possibly compromise the trade secrets of agency contractors. The appellant also relied upon a memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of the Army emphasizing the importance of avoiding these same ethical issues and the penalties for failing to do so. Moreover, the appellant's second-level supervisor also concluded that the event should not take place given the potential legal issues. This evidence more than suffices to provide a layman (like the appellant) with a reasonable belief that the project manager's proposed course of conduct could violate agency regulations. <span class="Italic">See Stiles v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 17 (2011) (an employee need not prove an actual violation to establish that he had a reasonable belief that his disclosure met the statutory criteria); <span class="Italic">Lane v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 27 (2010) (the appellant's reliance on the Contracting Officer's recommendation regarding the proper handling of an invoice suggested that he had a reasonable basis for believing his supervisor's conduct was contrary to law); <span class="Italic">Schnell</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 20 (the reasonableness of the appellant's belief that the agency was violating the law was supported by a report concluding that the agency needed to improve its monitoring of contractor performance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A supervisor's informed guidance and the appellant's knowledge of written expert guidance may negate the reasonableness of an allegedly protected disclosure, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Basil v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-1221-21-0633-W-1 (NP 3/23/2023), involving an information specialist's disagreement about application of FOIA exemptions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication in the record that the appellant is a lawyer. There are also several references in the record to the appellant being a "new hire" <span id="Page_3692"></span>starting in approximately August 2020 and reflecting that she was in the process of learning how to respond to FOIA requests. These factors favor a finding that the reasonable person in her position could believe that the misapplication of FOIA exemptions violated the statute. <span class="Italic">See Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 9 (2013) (considering an appellant's lack of expertise and experience in legal matters in finding that she made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated various laws, rules, and regulations). However, the appellant indicated that, upon starting in her new position, she read the DOJ Guide for "roughly three weeks...with a fine highlighter." She then relied on the DOJ Guide both in her disclosures and in her pleadings as the basis for her belief that FOIA exemptions were being misapplied. Because the appellant both stated and demonstrated her familiarity with the DOJ Guide, we find that she failed to nonfrivolously allege that a reasonable person in her position could have believed the agency violated the law by exercising its discretion to elect which exemptions to cite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, the court concluded that a Federal employee could not reasonably believe that his supervisor's determination that a landowner was not eligible for Government assistance was a violation of the Conservation Reserve Program law. <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, 561 F. App'x at 930. The court reasoned that the law granted discretionary authority to the agency, and the appellant's supervisor was in charge of exercising that discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, as in the case of the law at issue in <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, agencies generally have discretion to apply FOIA exemptions, provided they do not withhold information they are required to release under FOIA. Further, as the appellant acknowledged, her supervisor had the authority to determine whether to exercise that discretion. Therefore, we find the appellant could not have reasonably believed that the agency's choice to rely on what she personally viewed as the incorrect FOIA exemption was a violation of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the appellant's claim that in making her disclosure she primarily sought clarification from her supervisor about how the FOIA exemptions are applied further supports our finding that she did not reasonably believe that her disclosure evidenced the misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Webb</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (finding that an appellant's emails to agency officials requesting clarification as to whether a proposed policy ran afoul of agency regulations did not constitute a disclosure of a violation of law, rule, or regulation). Thus, we find that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that her communications about the agency's misapplication of FOIA exemptions were protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Basil</span> added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has found an employee's disagreement over job-related issues is insufficient to amount to a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Francis v.

Dept. of Interior</span>, 69 MSPR 354, 359 (1996) (no protected disclosure when the employee knew, at the time of disclosure, that the individual against whom the complaint was made abandoned a proposal to use federal funds in a manner arguably violating agency rules); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 605 n.19 (1984) (reprisal occurs if the individual taking the reprisal believes the allegations to be false; the question is whether the individual making the allegations reasonably believed them to be true). The Board considers whether the appellant's disclosure was based on a reasonable interpretation of events when he made the disclosure or whether it was based on unreliable or scanty information. <span class="Italic">Perry v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 298, 303-04 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (appellant could reasonably believe that an agency official was guilty of an apparent a conflict of interest based on a contractor's apparent admission that work on the official's house was done at less than 50% of the normal charge); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Langer v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nafus v.
