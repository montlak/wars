<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-29"><span class="space">c.</span> Belated Submission of Request, Documentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An FMLA request ordinarily must be timely invoked, <span class="Italic">Fryer v. Dept. of Energy,</span> DC-0752-10-0364-I-1 (NP 9/16/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), an employee must timely invoke her entitlement to FMLA leave and may not retroactively invoke her entitlement to FMLA leave unless she is physically or mentally incapable of invoking her entitlement during the entire period in which she is absent from work for an FMLA-qualifying purpose. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206; <span class="Italic">Dias v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 7 (2006) (An appellant put on notice by agency must timely submit evidence to support FMLA request), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 223 F. App'x 986 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, even if we assumed <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant requested FMLA leave, she did not provide medical documentation to support it for the first two months after her period of AWOL began, and when she did provide medical documentation, this documentation failed to meet the criteria for FMLA medical documentation because it did not contain the "appropriate medical facts regarding the serious health condition." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA,</span> DC-0752-13-0199-I-2 (NP 2/20/2015), also explained the necessity for timely and specific FMLA information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that he was improperly denied FMLA protection for the period designated as AWOL. The administrative judge found that the appellant did not timely or adequately respond to the <span id="Page_2480"></span>agency's requests for documentation, and therefore the agency properly denied FMLA protection. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will examine FMLA eligibility or require the agency to disprove entitlement to FMLA leave when the appellant makes nonfrivolous allegations of FMLA leave eligibility or the agency's evidence or allegations otherwise show that FMLA-qualifying leave was involved. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 54, 74 (1997). In reviewing an absence where FMLA is involved, the Board will consider whether, in pertinent part, the appellant submitted timely and substantively sufficient written medical certification under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 76-78. On July 12, 2012, the agency advised the appellant of his rights and responsibilities under FMLA, including the requirement that he submit an FMLA certification by July 27, 2012. The appellant submitted an FMLA certification form on September 5, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the agency human resources specialist who reviewed the appellant's FMLA paperwork testified that the appellant did not adequately respond to the agency's request for medical information. He testified that the agency followed the Office of Personnel Management's FMLA regulations. The applicable FMLA regulations for medical certification require that the certification should include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The date the serious health condition commenced; (2) [t]he probable duration of the serious health condition...; (3) [t]he appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by a health care provider...; (5)&#8197;...a statement that the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his [&#8197;] position or requires medical treatment for a serious health condition, based on written information provided by the agency on the essential functions of the employee's position or, if not provided, discussion with the employee about the essential functions of his [&#8197;] position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(b)(1)-(3), (5). The human resource specialist also testified to the inconsistencies on the FMLA paperwork submitted by the appellant's physician and why he advised the appellant's supervisor that the FMLA paperwork was not sufficient. The medical certification indicated that the appellant was totally incapacitated only for the period of August 22, 2012, through September 5, 2012, and not the entire period in the charge. The certification indicated that the appellant needed follow-up treatment and might require a reduced or intermittent schedule in the future, but the physician was not able to determine at that time for how long such care would be needed, other than to reflect a requirement for weekly to biweekly appointments. The physician did not indicate whether the appellant's medical condition would have future incidents that might render him incapacitated or prevent him from performing normal daily activities. Finally, the medical form contained no indication that the appellant was unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his position. Given the lack of specificity, including the absence of treatment information, and the lack of a statement reflecting the appellant's incapacity to perform his job duties, we find the appellant did not submit sufficient information for the agency to approve his FMLA request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's human resource specialist also testified that the appellant did not timely submit the medical information for FMLA approval. HCD. We agree. An agency may require that a request for FMLA protection be supported by a medical certification from the employee's health care provider, and the employee must provide such certification within 15 calendar days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(a), (h). If not practicable to provide the certification within 15 days despite "diligent, good faith efforts," the employee may have a reasonable amount of additional time, not to exceed 30 days from the agency's request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(h). Here the agency notified the appellant on July 12, 2012, of the need to submit FMLA certification to support his leave request by July 27, 2012. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(a) (permitting an agency to require a medical certification in support of a request for FMLA in certain circumstances). The appellant did not submit this documentation until September 5, 2012. The appellant's submission was filed beyond the 15 days allowed under the regulations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(h). He also failed to demonstrate that he made diligent, good faith efforts to obtain the documentation and that it was not practicable to obtain the documentation within 15 calendar days. Because he did not provide all the required information needed for approval within the required time frame, we find that the agency properly denied his request for leave under the FMLA.</p>

There is, however, an exception for incapacity, but it only applies where the incapacity exists during the entire period for which the employee is absent from work for an FMLA-qualifying purpose. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 631.1203(b).")

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Kone v. Dept. of Navy,</span> PH-0752-13-0217-I-3 (NP 2/27/2015), the agency's requirements for FMLA can be no more restrictive than the FMLA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an employee's need for FMLA leave is unforeseeable, and leave cannot be requested in advance, the pertinent regulation requires the employee to "provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(d). Although an agency may apply its own procedures to leave requests under the FMLA it may not apply a more restrictive policy than that provided under the FMLA and may not deny the employee leave for failure to follow agency procedures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383; <span class="Italic">Burge v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dias v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DIAS_KAMAL_NY_0752_04_0279_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247237.pdf">102 MSPR 53</a>, 55-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-15, 2006 MSPB 124 (2006), determined that an employee will not ordinarily be able to first submit at the adverse action appeal hearing medical information supporting an FMLA leave request that should have been submitted when that request was submitted by the employee and considered by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA allows an employee to take up to 12 weeks of leave per year (paid or unpaid) for various purposes, including because of an employee's own serious health condition or in order to care for a parent who has a serious health condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1). An agency "may require" that a request for such leave be supported by documentation from a health care provider. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(a). The employee must submit this documentation to the agency "in a timely manner." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Long before the passage of the FMLA, the Board held that an employee may defend against a leave-related adverse action by presenting, on appeal, evidence of incapacitation for duty that was never submitted to the agency prior to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kmiecz v. Department of the Army</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 673, 677 (1986). However, as recognized in <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 83, 87 (1997), and as noted above, an agency is entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(a) to require an employee who requests FMLA leave to submit documentation in support of the request "in a timely manner." Thus, in a case such as this, the FMLA may supersede the Board's doctrine that permits evidence of incapacitation to be submitted for the first time on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation of the FMLA is reasonable, given that the FMLA contains its own mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the adequacy of an employee's medical documentation. Specifically, if an agency doubts the validity of an employee's documentation, it may require the employee who is requesting leave to obtain the opinion of a second health care provider who is designated by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(c)(1). If that second opinion differs from the opinion of the original health care provider, an agency may require that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider who is designated jointly by the agency and the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(d)(1). The opinion of the third health care provider "shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the employing agency and the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(d)(2). The Board is not part of this dispute-resolution mechanism devised by Congress, which is intended to achieve a "final" and "binding" determination on the employee's need for FMLA leave. Simply put, the Board cannot allow an employee to bypass this scheme by ignoring the agency's request for medical evidence under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383 and then attempting to present evidence to support the leave request for the first time in a Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, if an employee is not on notice that she is required to submit evidence to the agency to support an FMLA leave request, it may be appropriate for the Board to consider evidence submitted for the first time on appeal. Here, however, as discussed below, the agency properly notified the appellant that she was required to submit evidence in support of her FMLA leave request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant, who had no accrued sick or annual leave, did not return to duty after her most recent 14-day suspension for AWOL, she requested, via William Davis, her union representative, a "Leave of Absence" and LWOP under the FMLA "due to medical and special familial circumstances," covering the period from November 21, 2003, through January 2, 2004. In response, the agency notified the appellant's union representative that the appellant's request for LWOP could not be granted unless it was supported by "adequate documentation...in accordance with the [FMLA] regulations." The agency informed the appellant's union representative, "If [the appellant needs] assistance regarding documentation requirements[,] please consult with [the] Human Resource Management Service." Davis contended that the appellant had the right under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA) not to submit documentation until she returned to work. The agency subsequently sent a letter directly to the appellant informing her that she was considered AWOL and that her request for LWOP would not be granted unless she submitted appropriate documentation. The appellant did not submit documentation in response to any of the agency's entreaties and it ultimately removed her for AWOL (November 18, 2003-January 1, 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the appellant submitted medical evidence to the AJ that she never submitted to the agency, and which the AJ considered. While <span id="Page_2481"></span>the AJ apparently concluded that the documentation supporting the appellant's LWOP request to care for her ailing parents was "vague and unspecific," the AJ determined that the evidence demonstrated that the appellant was entitled to LWOP under the FMLA because of her own health condition and because the time required for the on-going care of her parents was "substantial." The AJ further determined that the agency did not provide proper guidance to the appellant regarding her rights and responsibilities under the FMLA and, as a result, the appellant's failure to submit documentation to the agency in support of her LWOP request must be excused.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ incorrectly determined that the agency failed to provide the appellant with adequate notice under the FMLA. The appellant repeatedly failed to respond to requests from the agency that she provide documentation to support her LWOP request. In addition, the appellant clearly had some familiarity with the FMLA, given that she expressly cited it in her LWOP request. If the appellant had made some effort to support her request for LWOP with documentation and the agency had found her documentation to be inadequate but did not provide guidance regarding what precisely it would deem adequate documentation, such a lack of guidance could provide a basis for considering the appellant's evidence that was submitted for the first time on appeal. As described above, however, the appellant made no effort whatsoever to supply the agency with the requested documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant chose to make her LWOP request through her union representative; hence, she cannot now contend that the agency erroneously responded to the union official with its documentation request rather than contacting the appellant directly. Again, the appellant did not make <span class="Italic">any</span> attempt to comply with the agency's directive that was sent to her union official or make <span class="Italic">any</span> attempt to submit documentation in response to the agency's subsequent letter that it sent directly to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must be emphasized that there is no evidence in the record that the agency ever acted in such a manner as to mislead the appellant to believe that her request for LWOP had been granted. Despite the AJ's conclusions to the contrary, the burden was on the appellant either to report for work as scheduled or to find out what she needed to do in order to have her LWOP request granted. This is particularly true given that, as previously discussed, the appellant has a long history of leave-related discipline and had barely finished serving a 14-day suspension for an earlier AWOL charge when she was warned that she would be charged AWOL again if she did not report to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, it must be noted that, except in extreme circumstances not present here, an employee must comply with a lawful order and grieve the propriety of that order later. Simply put, the appellant was not entitled to disobey the order because she disagreed with it. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Moreover, the AJ did not determine that the appellant's refusal to submit medical evidence to the agency was justified under the CBA and the appellant has not filed a cross-petition for review to so argue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the FMLA contains its own mechanism for resolving a dispute regarding the sufficiency of medical evidence submitted in support of a leave request. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383. As a result, under the circumstances of this case, the Board cannot approve the appellant's refusal to support her FMLA leave request with medical evidence until after the agency denied the request and charged her with AWOL. Accordingly, the appellant's evidence of her own health condition and that of her parents, submitted for the first time on appeal, should not be considered. In the absence of this information, the agency's AWOL charge must be SUSTAINED.</p>
