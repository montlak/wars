<p class="Body-Text">Should the appellant lose disability retirement benefits because of recovery of earning capacity, the appellant may, if eligible, qualify for a discontinued service annuity, <span class="Italic">Loube v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 531, 532-33 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's disability retirement annuity became effective on February 1, 1976, upon the determination that he was totally disabled for the position he held with the federal government. However, on August 20, 1979, OPM informed appellant that, because during the years 1977 and 1978 his reported earnings were eighty percent or more of the current salary for the position from which he retired, he was considered restored to earning capacity.[1] Appellant's annuity was then converted to a discontinued service annuity, beginning on January 1, 1980, and his years under disability annuity were counted, for calculation of his discontinued service annuity, as years of service.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, appellant contended that OPM's computation of his discontinued service annuity was incorrect. The presiding official considered this argument, but affirmed the OPM decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disability annuitant is deemed restored to earning capacity upon meeting the test of earning eighty percent of the current salary for the position from which he retired for two successive years.[3] However, the termination of a disability retirement does not render an annuitant ineligible for any other retirement annuity for which he may qualify.[4] For the purposes of computing the new annuity, the annuitant is considered involuntarily separated from the service as of the date his annuity was discontinued, the years under disability annuity thus being counted as years of service.[5] His new annuity is therefore calculated as if his retirement began on the date following the termination of his disability annuity. Cost-of-living allowances for annuitants are calculated from the date at which the annuity commenced.[6]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e), FPM Supp. 831-1, S10-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8340(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Waite v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 212, 213-16 (1985), termination of disability retirement benefits (because of recovery) may lead to a discontinued service annuity entitlement if the requisite conditions are met (also examining the effective of military service on the years of civil service credit required for discontinued service annuity):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed in the civil service until June 12, 1978, when he began receiving a disability retirement annuity. On June 11, 1978, he was recalled to active duty in the U.S. Army. Although he was serving in the Army, he continued to receive his annuity until December 31, 1981, when that annuity was terminated on the ground that his receipt of earnings showed that he had recovered. OPM later determined that the annuity should have been terminated on November 23, 1980, and the termination therefore was made effective retroactive to that date. On March 14, 1984, the appellant applied for a discontinued service annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8336(d) of title 5, U.S.C., provides in part that a person who is separated from the service involuntarily may receive a discontinued service annuity if he has completed 25 years of creditable service at the time of his separation, or if he is 50 years old and has completed 20 years of service at that time. Furthermore, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e), an annuitant whose disability annuity is terminated because of his recovery from his <span id="Page_4198"></span>disability is considered (subject to an exception described below) to have been involuntarily separated as of the date of termination. The appellant was less than 50 years old on November 23, 1980, the date his annuity was terminated. He therefore is entitled to a discontinued service annuity only if he had 25 years of creditable service on that date. Because he had only 23 years and 9 months of creditable service at the time of his retirement, he is not entitled to the discontinued service annuity unless either his post-retirement military service or his time as an annuitant is credited for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the presiding official cited <span class="Italic">Loube v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 531 (1981), in which the Board stated that the time during which the appellant in that case was receiving a disability retirement annuity was credited for purposes of determining whether that appellant was entitled to a discontinued service annuity, and in which it indicated that this credit was proper. She stated further that, under Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 831-1, subchapter 3-5, the appellant was entitled to credit for honorable military service performed prior to his separation. Accordingly, she concluded that the appellant qualified for a discontinued service annuity based either on the time he was receiving a disability retirement annuity or on his post-retirement military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM notes that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e) provides that an annuitant whose disability retirement annuity is terminated as a result of his recovery from his disability "is deemed, <span class="Italic">except for service credit,</span> to have been involuntarily separated from the service...as of the date of termination of the disability annuity..." (emphasis added). It contends that the phrase "except for service credit," as applied here, means that the appellant is not entitled to any credit earned after the appellant's disability retirement. It contends further that the Board's statement in <span class="Italic">Loube</span> regarding the manner in which OPM had computed the creditable service of the appellant in that case was incorrect, and that it did not pursue the matter further in connection with that case because its own "action was affirmed and the incorrect statements were mere dicta."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The predecessor to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e) evidently was added to civil service retirement law by Public Law 84-854 (the Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956), whose legislative history includes the following explanation of the section:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under existing law if a disability annuitant recovers and is unable to obtain reemployment or for any other reason does not return to service under the act, he is considered as having been separated from service as of the date of his retirement for disability and entitled only to a deferred annuity at age 62. The bill modifies this provision so that a disability annuitant who recovers or is restored to earning capacity before he attains age 60 will be considered (except for service credit) as having been involuntarily separated from the service upon termination of the disability annuity. This change would permit the granting of immediate annuity if the employee is otherwise entitled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 2642, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1956 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 3725, 3732.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The meaning of the phrase "except for service credit" is not entirely clear on its face, and neither party to this case has cited any cases in which that phrase has been given an interpretation which would clarify its applicability to this case. The legislative history quoted above indicates, however, that the purpose of the provision in which the phrase appears was to reduce the adverse effect of the recovered annuitant's former disability on his entitlement to a different kind of annuity. Because a person receiving a disability retirement annuity generally would not be expected to be performing any creditable service prior to his recovery, it seems logical that Congress would wish to clarify this provision by ensuring that the annuitant would not receive credit for service during that period which he did not actually perform. We can see no reason, however, for concluding that Congress intended to deny recovered annuitants credit for service which was actually performed and which was covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332 (the section defining "creditable service"). We therefore conclude that the phrase "except for service credit" has the effect of excluding credit for the time during which a recovered annuitant was receiving a disability retirement annuity unless the annuitant was performing actual service creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332 during that time. We conclude further that actual creditable service performed by the recovered annuitant while he was receiving a disability retirement annuity is not excluded under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above conclusions, we find that the appellant's military service between the date of his disability retirement and the date on which his disability retirement annuity was terminated is creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332. In addition, because this service, along with his prior creditable service, totaled over 25 years, we find that the appellant became entitled to a discontinued service annuity on November 23, 1980, the date on which his disability retirement annuity was terminated.</p>
