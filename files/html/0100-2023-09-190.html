<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-187"><span class="space">b.</span> Joinder; Compulsory Joinder</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Joinder of two cases is appropriate if an individual appellant has two or more appeals pending, e.g., a 30-day suspension and a subsequent removal, or a WIGI denial and a Chapter 43 performance-based removal that may soon follow, 5 CFR 1201.36 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Explanation</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Joinder occurs when one person has filed two or more appeals and they are united for consideration. For example, a judge might join an appeal challenging a 30-day suspension with a pending appeal challenging a subsequent removal if the same appellant filed both appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Action by judge</span>. A judge may consolidate or join cases on his or her own motion or on the motion of a party if doing so would:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Expedite processing of the cases; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Not adversely affect the interests of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Any objection to a motion for consolidation or joinder must be filed within 10 days of the date of service of the motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Joinder may be inappropriate if appeals are at different levels. The Board denied a motion to join an appeal from the denial of a step increase with the appeal of a subsequent removal when the removal was already adjudicated and was the subject of a PFR. <span class="Italic">Gantt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 336, 337, 4 MSPB 401 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Schoening v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 34 MSPR 556, 560-61 (1987) (joinder proper as to adverse actions but not as to a collateral retirement claim before OPM: no showing that any foreclosure of discovery was harmful). The Board occasionally joins appeals at the PFR level. <span class="Italic">Worthington v. USDA</span>, 43 MSPR 620, 621 (1990). Joinder does not waive individual PFR filing deadlines. <span class="Italic">Blair v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 113, 118 &#x00B6; 14 (2001). The Board may unhinge PFRs from appeals joined by a AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rutz v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 68, 69 n.* (1984). The AJ's decision on joinder will not be disturbed without a showing of prejudice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boechler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 109 MSPR 619, 630 &#x00B6; 21, 2008 MSPB 188 (2008) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Hau v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HAU_ANDREAS_SF_4324_16_0268_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1338186.pdf">123 MSPR 620</a>, 625-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 2016 MSPB 33 (2016)). The Board may receive appeals that could be separately filed, but are filed as one. The AJ may split the appeals and treat them separately, e.g., if the cases involve two separate agencies taking different actions against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nolan v. DOJ</span>, 52 MSPR 476, 479 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers whether provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing joinder compel the Board to join parties who are necessary parties to an action, a situation that is occasionally encountered in retirement appeals involving competing claims through notice of the right to intervene. [Discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-195.html#sec2-192">Intervention</a>."] As to compulsory joinder, under <span class="Italic">Azdell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board does not have its own rule on joinder of persons but is guided by Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Webb v. Office of Personnel</span> Management, 37 M.S.P.R. 541, 543 n.3 (1988); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 274, 285 n.8 (1988); <span class="Italic">Dowd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 521, 522 (1983). Rule 19(a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Persons to be Joined if Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff. If the joined party objects to venue and joinder of that party would render venue of the action improper, that party shall be dismissed from the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first joinder standard, which is prescribed in Rule 19(a)(1), is designed to protect those who already are parties by requiring the presence of all persons who have an interest in the litigation so that any relief that may be awarded will effectively and completely adjudicate the dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 7 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &#x0026; Mary Kay Kane (Wright, Miller &#x0026; Kane), <span class="Italic">Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Practice and Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 1604 at 41 (3d. ed. 2001). For example, in <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> the Board ordered the employing agency to be joined as a necessary party after finding that in its absence complete relief could not be accorded should the appellant prevail. 16 M.S.P.R. at 522. Here, however, joinder of the intervenors is not necessary to effectuate the appellants' requested relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second test set out in Rule 19(a) relates to situations in which the action cannot be effectively adjudicated because the absentee claims an interest in the subject matter of the action and disposing of the case in the person's absence may prejudice either those already before the court or the absentee. 7 Wright, Miller &#x0026; Kane &#x00A7; 1604 at 51. The Supreme Court has explained that this provision of Rule 19 "obviously does not mean either (a) that a court may never issue a judgment that, in practice, affects a nonparty or (b) that (to the contrary) a court may always proceed without considering the potential effect on nonparties simply because they are not 'bound' in the technical sense." <span class="Italic">Provident Tradesmens Bank &#x0026; Trust Co. v. Patterson</span>, 390 U.S. 102, 110, 88 S. Ct. 733, 19 L. Ed.2d 936 (1968). Instead, a tribunal must consider the extent to which the judgment may as a practical matter impair or impede a nonparty's ability to protect his interest in the subject matter. <span class="Italic">Id. See also United States v. San Juan Bay Marina</span>, 239 F.3d 400, 406 (1st Cir. 2001) (a party is necessary under Rule 19(a) only if they claim a "legally protected interest" relating to the subject matter of the action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Northern Alaska Environmental Center v. Hodel</span>, 803 F.2d 466 (9th Cir. 1986), several environmental organizations sued to restrain the National Park Service (NPS) from approving mining plans and access to permits in Alaska's national parks until complying fully with the National Environmental Protection Act. 803 F.2d at 467. The NPS moved to join all miners having approved or pending operations plans, but the district court denied the motion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling on the joinder motion, finding that the absent miners, although affected by the litigation, did not possess the requisite legally protected interest in the subject matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 468. The court defined the subject matter of the dispute as concerning NPS procedures regarding mining approval. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 469. The court acknowledged that all miners were "interested" in how stringent the requirements would be. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nevertheless, the court found that the miners had no legal entitlement <span id="Page_1170"></span>to any given set of procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the court concluded that denial of the joinder motion was not an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in the instant case preference eligible applicants have some interest in the outcome of this litigation because the relief ordered by the Board may affect the manner in which these applicants can compete for future ALJ vacancies. That does not mean, however, that they possess a legally protected interest in the subject matter of this appeal. Preference eligible applicants hold no legal entitlement in OPM's scoring formula. Thus, they have not been deprived of any legal rights, including their right to have OPM comply with veterans' preference statutes and regulations. While it may have been feasible to join all of the preference eligible applicants who were on the ALJ register as of February 7, 1997, or to permit them to form a separate class," the CALJ did not abuse his discretion by not doing so. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (adjudicative error which is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal). Finally, the Board has fully weighed and considered the arguments of the intervenors both on petition for review and again on reconsideration. With the exception of the intervenors' due process arguments which we have addressed above, we note that most of the arguments that the intervenors have raised concerning the validity of the 1996 scoring formula and the Board's jurisdiction to consider the implementation of this formula have been similar or virtually identical to the arguments advanced by OPM and rejected by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Joinder of appeals will not be a basis for setting aside an AJ's decision unless the appellant shows how joinder adversely affected his interests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pulido v. DLA</span>, 61 MSPR 145, 147 n.1 (1994) (AJ may consolidate or join appeals on her own motion if doing so expedites adjudication and does not adversely affect the parties' interests). But cases should not be joined if there is the possibility of prejudice to the appellant. In <span class="Italic">Draper v. Dept. of Army</span>, 51 MSPR 518, 520-21 (1991), the appellant appealed the denial of a within-grade increase. The appellant, who was also demoted, filed an EEO complaint concerning the demotion. The agency sought to join the demotion and the WIGI appeal by claiming that the two actions involved testimony from the same witnesses and similar issues. Over the appellant's objections, the AJ dismissed the WIGI appeal without prejudice to refiling at the time the appellant received a final agency EEO decision on her demotion. The Board disagreed with the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. VA</span>, 51 MSPR 218, 221 (1991), the Board held that, as a matter of policy, an administrative judge should not grant an agency's request for a dismissal without prejudice. Rather, where the circumstances of a case warrant, the administrative judge should grant a continuance and require the agency to set a date certain by which it agrees to proceed with the appeal. The Board explained that when the delay is for the benefit of the agency, the appellant should not face the additional burden of refiling or otherwise reinstating his or her appeal. We, therefore, find that the administrative judge erred in granting the agency's motion, and that, under the circumstances presented in this case, a continuance is not warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with the administrative judge's determination that, should the appellant elect to appeal both matters to the Board, judicial economy would be better served by joining the demotion action with the appeal of the denial of the within-grade increase. The administrative judge's reasoning would, in effect, force the appellant to relinquish her EEO appeal and pursue her demotion action with the Board in order to have a speedy adjudication of her appeal from the denial of her within-grade increase. The appellant, however, may never appeal the demotion action to the Board, and a determination on that action is not necessary to a proper adjudication of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an apparent error by the employing agency misleads an employee into selecting one or another retirement option and the employee then lodges an appeal against an OPM retirement determination, the Board may direct the regional office to docket a separate involuntary retirement appeal against the employing agency<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Weaver v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 555, 556 (1998). The Board sometimes avoids the compulsory joinder of the employing agency by directing correction of a benefit determination made on the basis of improper information from the employing agency, when correction is permissible under the retirement law and implementing regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alford v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 114, 117-18 &#x00B6; 8 (1998) (agency was invited to participate in a Board appeal as a permissive intervenor when the appellant desired retirement and the issue was whether the Board could direct OPM to approve the retirement, because the agency had allegedly failed to advise the employee that his acceptance of a lower-graded position would effectively withdraw his disability retirement application; partially overruling<span class="Italic"> Coleman v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 570, 576 (1990), calling for a mandatory joinder, through a constructive adverse action appeal, of an agency under similar circumstances); <span class="Italic">Lessard v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 371, 376 (1990) (directing a correction in the appellant's disability annuity when it was clear what choice would have been made had the agency properly advised the appellant of his retirement options). [Refer to analogous cases discussed in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a> on retirement.] The Board will not join OPM as a respondent if the retirement dispute (collection of an annuity overpayment) is unrelated to the underlying case (an adverse action) based only on the appellant's assertion that OPM is harassing the appellant at the instance of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 85 MSPR 684, 690 &#x00B6; 15 (2000). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-072.html#sec6-72">Employing Agency as Party to Appeal Against OPM</a>," for joinder of employing agencies as respondents to cases initiated against OPM and involving claims of coerced or agency-initiated retirements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ improperly failed to join related whistleblowing reprisal appeals in <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCARTHY_ROBERT_JOHN_DA_1221_09_0725_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_628714.pdf">116 MSPR 594</a>, 602-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13, 2011 MSPB 74 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review that, by joining his appeals for hearing only, the administrative judge "artificially separated the effects of the removal decision into a loss of employment and a loss of benefits, when in fact the same decision had both results." The Board is authorized to join two or more appeals filed by the same appellant and hear and decide them concurrently if it determines that joinder "could result in the appeals' being processed more expeditiously and would not adversely affect any party." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(f)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.36(b). The decision whether to join two appeals is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the administrative judge in accordance with the guidance set forth above. Because we find that the administrative judge's failure to fully join these appeals adversely affected the appellant's ability to adjudicate his claims concerning his FEHB coverage and relocation expenses, the administrative judge's decision in this regard constituted an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stein-Verbit v. Department of Commerce,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 332, 338-42 (1996) (the administrative judge's decision to bifurcate the charges under the circumstances of the case constituted an abuse of discretion where the decision incurred on the appellant's right to present a full defense and to have a meaningful right to a hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the appellant alleges that the agency's actions in terminating him, discontinuing his FEHB coverage, and refusing to reimburse him for relocation expenses all constituted reprisal for having made the disclosures set forth in his July 28, 2009 memorandum. Where, as here, the appellant has filed more than one complaint with OSC in support of an overall claim of reprisal for whistleblowing activity, an administrative judge should not take a piecemeal approach by adjudicating separate, but related, personnel actions in separate appeals. Given the similarity of the issues presented and the likely overlap of evidence and witnesses, joinder of the appellant's two pending IRA appeals for adjudication was appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Groseclose v. Department of the Navy,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6; 14 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the administrative judge erred by adjudicating the appellant's claims concerning his FEHB coverage and relocation expenses without considering them in the context of his termination appeal and by denying corrective action in the appellant's FEHB appeal on the ground that the appellant failed to establish that his disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's actions because he failed to identify the agency official responsible for making those decisions or show that such deciding official knew of his disclosures. The appellant's contentions concerning his entitlement to FEHB coverage and relocation expenses are inextricably intertwined with his contention that he was unlawfully terminated in reprisal for whistleblowing activity. Although the appellant did not specifically allege that the agency officials involved in the decisions affecting his FEHB coverage and reimbursement for his relocation expenses knew of his disclosures, he has alleged in the termination appeal that Commissioner Ruth, the deciding official, had actual knowledge of his whistleblowing activity, and that his whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the decision to terminate him. The appellant's entitlement to corrective action in the form of continued FEHB coverage or relocation expenses does not require the appellant to establish that the officials who made the determinations concerning them had actual knowledge of his disclosures. Rather, an appellant may establish imputed or constructive knowledge of his disclosures by demonstrating that an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure influenced the official accused of taking the retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 104, 108 (1994). Thus, the administrative judge erred by dismissing the appellant's FEHB appeal for failure to demonstrate that the deciding official had actual knowledge of his protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an additional basis for our determination, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(a) provides that corrective action may include "back pay and related benefits,...travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes." Thus, the appellant's request for corrective action in his termination appeal could include the relief that he seeks in his FEHB appeal. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge's failure to join the instant appeals was an abuse of discretion, and we join them for adjudication pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.36(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board joined PFRs from the two decisions, an AJ properly declined to join IRA appeals involving a proposed and imposed suspension, <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-1221-12-0456-W-1 (NP 9/17/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant contends on review that administrative judge erred in failing to join the appeals for purposes of adjudication below, we disagree. Because the appellant did not file her second IRA appeal until <span id="Page_1171"></span>July 2, 2012, after the prehearing conference in the first IRA appeal, it was not an abuse of discretion under the circumstances for the administrative judge to docket the matter as a separate appeal. We also reject the appellant's contention that the administrative judge erroneously failed to join her involuntary resignation appeal to her IRA appeals for purposes of adjudication. <span class="Italic">Cf. Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638-39 (1991) ("[T]he Board's jurisdiction to review IRA complaints based on personnel actions over which it otherwise does not have appellate jurisdiction is limited to adjudicating the whistleblower allegations."). In any event, the appellant has failed to establish that her substantive rights were prejudiced as a result of the administrative judge's failure to join the appeals. An adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Compliance or enforcement petitions may be joined. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 556, 560-61 &#x00B6; 10 (2002) (joinder of compliance claims arising from two settlement agreements); <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 25 MSPR 408, 409 n.1 (1984) ("Because both petitions for enforcement involve related arguments dealing with the agency's alleged non-compliance with the settlement agreement, we find that joining the petitions on review will be more expeditious than separate adjudication of each petition and that such joinder will not adversely affect any party."). The Board recognized, during a compliance proceeding a claim that probably should have been separately docketed but was addressed by the parties and the AJ. The Board could then rule on the claim, assuming a record sufficient to permit adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 418, 423-24 &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (after reversing a resignation as constructive removal, the Board reversed the LWOP leading to the resignation, even though the leave was not docketed as a separate constructive suspension appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cases from different tribunals, e.g., MSPB and EEOC, will not be joined. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDermott v.
