<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-13"><span class="space">2.</span> Office of Appeals Counsel</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Quietly working at the Board's headquarters offices in Washington, D.C., are thirty to so lawyers, collectively known as the Office of Appeals Counsel (OAC), who review case records and appellate briefs and who draft recommended decisions for review by Board members (and the attorneys on each member's staff) on petitions for review (PFRs) of initial decisions issued by Board AJs in the regional and field offices, in original jurisdiction cases, and in other cases assigned by the Board. [The "<a href="0100-2023-12-032.html#sec5-33">PFR Process</a>" is described in Chapter 5.] OAC lawyers also prepare recommendations concerning interlocutory and arbitration appeals, evaluate PFRs from initial decisions of the Board's contract ALJs, review stay requests from the Office of Special Counsel, process court remands and OPM requests for reconsideration, establish special briefing schedules, and, along with staff in the Clerk's office, consider requests for time extensions and motions for intervention, consolidation, and case joinder. The OAC lawyers, usually GS-13s and GS-14s, review the initial decisions of the AJs, often GS-15s. OAC lawyers and AJs are in the same bargaining unit, represented by the same labor union. Notwithstanding their bargaining unit solidarity, some decisions from the Board, drafted by OAC attorneys (perhaps revised by Board members or their own legal assistants), are openly critical of the work product (initial decisions) of their AJ colleagues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OAC does not issue final Board decisions. That is done by the Board members who review, with the assistance of their staff legal advisors, OAC draft decisions or recommendations. After OAC reviews a case, it prepares an "analytical memorandum" providing a discussion for the Board members of the issues raised by the PFR. Accompanying the memo is a recommended Board order and opinion. A "decision sheet" is used by Board members to indicate by check marks and initials whether they adopt, reject, or seek to modify or have rewritten the proposed opinion and order. The decision sheets are available through FOIA or the Privacy Act. Following a 2000 change in the Board's Privacy Act records systems descriptions, OAC analytical memoranda are no longer ordinarily accessible by appellants through the Privacy Act. When the Board issues a final decision, the Clerk mails it or places it on the e-filing system, and the decision is usually issued under the name of the Clerk, although from time to time Board members issue decisions under their own names. Board decisions issued at the headquarters level are posted its website, <a href="http://www.mspb.gov">www.mspb.gov</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprinted below are recent performance standards for attorneys working in the Office of Appeals Counsel. They are placed here to give a better understanding, albeit indirectly, of how the Board's review process works--expressed from the vantagepoint of an OAC attorney. The standards also provide an example of how the Board, with its knowledge of performance cases and the requirements of performance standards, establishes objective performance standards to assess the quality, quantity, and timeliness of OAC lawyers' efforts. The standards--and they may vary over time and from attorney to attorney--are:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;Rating</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Unacceptable: Produces at a rate of fewer than 48 raw cases per year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Minimally Successful: Produces at a rate of 48 to 53 raw cases per year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Fully Successful: Produces at a rate of 54 to 59 raw cases per year.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">Outstanding: Produces at a rate of 66 or more raw cases per year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">B.&#x2003;Counting raw cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Rule</span>. Generally, an attorney earns a raw case by preparing a written, recommended decision with accompanying memorandum that is forwarded to the Board for a vote. The raw case includes all, work integral to the production of the case. including the issuance of orders to show cause. At the end of the rating period, a case that has not been forwarded out of the office for a vote will be counted as a raw case for the ending rating period if, by close of business on the last day of the rating period: (1) the attorney has submitted a draft recommended decision with accompanying memorandum for the requisite supervisory review, and (2) the supervisor subsequently determines that the ease was substantially complete by the end of the rating period, i.e., acceptable for forwarding with minimal or no revision. The decision whether a case is substantially complete is within the sole discretion of OAC management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Counting Rewrites</span>. Subject to the general requirements in paragraph B. I, an attorney earns a raw case by preparing a written recommended decision with accompanying memorandum in response to a rewrite instruction other than a LAN-edit. An attorney will not earn a raw case or be taken "off standards" for work done in response to a rewrite instruction when the Associate Director determines that the original recommended disposition was clearly in error under the law as it existed when the recommendation was made or when the factual analysis was materially inadequate. The Associate Director's determination may be appealed to the Director within 7 calendar days. The Director's decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Counting Consolidated and Joined Cases</span>. Subject to the general requirements in paragraph B.l. an attorney earns two raw cases by preparing a recommended decision that joins or consolidates two separate cases pending at headquarters for decision. When an attorney recommends joining or consolidating three or more cases for decision, the Associate Director will determine whether the attorney should be deemed to have produced multiple cases or whether the attorney should be placed "off standards" for time reasonably spent on the cases (see paragraph C.3(b)). The attorney may appeal that determination to the Director within 7 calendar days. The Director's decision shall be final. In making this determination, management will consider the amount of work reasonably required to prepare the recommended decision, the number of cases involved, and any other pertinent factors. Generally, cases that arrive joined or consolidated from the regions will be counted as one raw case; however, Associate Directors may decide whether any adjustments are necessary on a case-by-case basis. The Associate Director's determination may be appealed to the Director within 7 calendar days. The Director's decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">C.&#x2003;Adjustments to Annual Production Requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Base work year.</span> The annual raw ease production requirements set forth in paragraph A are based on a 1,887 hour work year. This hourly figure is based on the Office of Personnel Management's computation of a 2,087 hour work year less 80 hours for the 10 federal holidays and 120 hours for general administrative time (see paragraph C.3(d)). The annual raw case production requirement for each attorney will be adjusted for leave usage and off-standards time as set forth in paragraphs C.2 and C.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Leave adjustment.</span> An attorney's annual raw ease production requirement will be reduced hour for hour for all approved annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, leave without pay, and military leave taken during the rating period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4"><span class="Italic">Example #1</span>: Assume an attorney who is on standards for the entire I-year rating period takes 160 hours of annual leave. 40 hours of sick leave, and 8 hours of administrative leave during the rating period. The annual raw ease production requirements for that attorney will be reduced by a proration factor computed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Proration factor = (1,887-160-40-8)/1,887</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Proration factor 1,679/1,887</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Proration factor = .890</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Thus, that attorney would need to earn the following number of raw eases, computed by multiplying the annual raw case production requirement by the proration factor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Minimally Successful: 48 raw cases * .890 =43 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Fully Successful: 54 raw cases * .890 = 48 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Exceeds Fully Successful: 60 raw cases * .890=53 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Outstanding: 66 raw cases * .890 = 59 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Off-standards time adjustment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(a)&#x2003;An attorney's annual raw ease production requirement will be reduced hour for hour to account for off-standards time approved by OAC management. An attorney must request the approval of his or her Associate Director for off-standards time within 2 weeks of performing the work forming the basis of the off-standards request. Untimely requests will not be considered unless there are extenuating circumstances justifying the delay. Whenever possible, an attorney should notify his or her Associate Director in advance before beginning such an activity requiring an off-standards time adjustment. The Associate Director may approve an attorney's request for off-standards time, partially approve the request, or deny the request. The attorney may appeal the Associate Director's decision to the Director within 7 calendar days. The Director's decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4"><span class="Italic">Example #2</span>: Assume that the attorney described in Example #1 in paragraph C.2 above also accrued 50 hours of approved off-standards time in addition to the leave described in Example #1. That attorney's annual raw case production requirements would be reduced by a proration factor computed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Proration Factor= (1,887-160-40-8-50)/1,887</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Proration Factor= 1,629/1,887</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Proration Factor = .863</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Thus, that attorney would need to earn the following number of raw cases, computed by multiplying the annual raw case production requirement by the proration factor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Minimally Successful: 48 raw cases * .863 41 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Fully Successful: 54 raw cases * .863 =47 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Exceeds FS: 60 raw cases .863 =52 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Outstanding: 66 raw cases * .863 = 57 raw cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(b)&#x2003;Case-related off-standards time. Attorneys may request off-standards time for the following case-related activities for which a raw case is not earned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Preparation of a substantive memorandum returning a LAN-edit rewrite to the Board</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5"><span id="Page_13"></span>Preparation of a memorandum in response to a request for an advisory opinion from a Board member</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Preparation of a concurring. dissenting. or separate opinion prepared at a Board member's request</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Preparation of a decision that consolidated or joined more than 2 cases (see paragraph B.3)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Preparation of a recommended decision and accompanying memorandum in a case that reasonably requires more than 80 hours to complete; the term "excess case hours" is defined as those hours in excess of 80 hours reasonably expended to prepare a case for which attorneys may request off-standards time</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Preparation of a response to a reconsideration request that reasonably requires more than 1 full work day to complete</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Non-case-related off-standards time</span>. Management will approve requests for off-standards time for approved, substantial noncase-related activities. Generally, such activities would each reasonably require 1 full work day or more to complete. Whenever possible, an attorney should notify his or her Associate Director in advance before beginning such an activity. If not made in advance, the request should be made as soon as possible after beginning the activity and at the latest within 2 weeks of completing the activity. The type of activities that could justify off-standards time includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Job-related training lasting I full day or longer</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Details</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Assignments to agency committees or working groups</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Official time in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Serving as an officer or keyworker for the CFC</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Planning or preparing a major Board function, including Unity Day and EEO special emphasis month events, that reasonably requires at least I full work day</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Attendance at the agency's legal conference</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Preparation for and participation in agency outreach events</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Acting as an Associate Director</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Administrative Time Allowance</span>. Off-standards time will not be approved for staff meetings and other relatively brief Board-related activities. As set forth above in paragraph C.l, the 1,887 hour base work year incorporates an allowance for each attorney of 120 hours for general administrative time. This allowance covers work time spent throughout the year on administrative matters for which the attorney does not earn a raw case credit or accrue off-standards time. The type of activities covered by this general administrative time allowance includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Staff meetings</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Reviewing e-mails</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Completing time and attendance reports</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Attending agency events. such as Unity Day, CFC events, holiday parties. LEO/Diversity events, and "Meet &#x0026; Greets" with other agencies</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Recreation Association or Holiday Party Planning Committees</p>

<p class="Block-Quote5">Routine LAN-edit review</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Routine reconsideration requests</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">Other relatively brief Board-related activities</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">D.&#x2003;Quarterly Assessments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During each quarter of the performance year, each attorney must meet at least 20% of the annual raw case production requirement at the Fully Successful level (prorated for leave usage and off-standards time in accordance with paragraph C). Failure to meet the 20% requirement in any quarter may result in the attorney being counseled on performance. Failure to meet the 20% requirement in two consecutive quarters in a discrete performance year shall result in the attorney being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan following the second consecutive quarter. Nothing in this paragraph limits management's authority under any law or regulation to promptly address performance issues. Management is not required to wait until the end of the annual rating period to place the attorney on a Performance Improvement Period. Regardless of whether his or her performance fails to meet the 20% requirement in two consecutive quarters in a discrete performance year, an attorney who fails to meet the Minimally Successful production standard (prorated for leave usage and offstandards time in accordance with paragraph C) at the close of the annual rating period shall be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">E.&#x2003;New Attorneys.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Newly hired attorneys shall not be held to case production standards for their first year, but they are expected to progress during the first year (with due consideration given to prior experience and training) so that by the end of their first year they are producing at the rate contemplated by the production element set forth in paragraph A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">F.&#x2003;Allowances for unusual circumstances</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Management may exercise its discretion to raise an attorney's productivity rating computed tinder tile formula set forth above in paragraphs A-C when the computed rating does not accurately reflect the attorney's overall productivity during the rating period. Management may take into account such factors as the relative difficulty of the attorney's ease work during the rating period given the employee's grade and whether the attorney's reasonable and efficient work on special projects, non-case related assignments, and/or an unusually difficult mix of assigned cases during the rating period adversely affected the attorney's overall rate of production. If the attorney believes that such circumstances existed during any quarter, the attorney shall so advise their Associate Director and the Deputy Director in writing within 2 weeks after the close of the quarter. Management will note in writing whether there were unusual circumstances in that quarter that might justify an adjustment at the close of the rating period if not counterbalanced by mitigating circumstances during the remainder of the rating period. The attorney may appeal the decision of the Deputy Director within 7 calendar days. The Director's decision on the appeal shall be final.</p>
