<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 WPEA, revised by the 2017 "Follow the Rules Act," made some disclosures under 5 USC 2302(b)((9) channels subject to protection under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) through IRA appeals if the &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) channel disclosures included allegations of the type of reprisal covered under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), e.g., if in an administrative grievance an employee complained of and then suffered reprisal for a disclosure through that grievance of a matter covered by &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)--or at least that appears to be the effect of the amendments. Also embraced are protections for those who assist in the covered disclosures, those who cooperate with the IG or OSC, and an individual who refuses to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Udomporn v.

<p class="Body-Text">Section 2302(b)(9) establishes an affirmative defense for actions directly appealed to the Board and taken (or not taken) because of one of the four stated bases. For a personnel actions appealed to the Board through the Individual Right of Action (IRA) process, later described, initiated with the Office of Special Counsel, the four statutory bases again apply, but with an exception. In the IRA appeal involving (b)((A), the appellant may only invoke the process as to reprisal for "the exercise of any" appeal, complaint, or grievance that protests a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8), meaning that the underlying appeal, complaint, or grievance resulting in reprisal must have contained a whistleblower disclosure defined by 5 USC 2302(b)(8).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A significant decision interpreting the WPEA IRA coverage of (b)(9)(B) is <span class="Italic">Hooker v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HOOKER_CARLTON_E_AT_1221_11_0246_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_997083.pdf">120 MSPR 629</a>, 638-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2014 MSPB 15 (2014), concluding that the WPEA amendment incorporating that section, in part, into (b)(8) was not applicable to cases pending on the effective date of the WPEA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under both the pre- and post-WPEA versions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), any employee who had the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action was prohibited, with respect to such authority, from taking or failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A). Thus, the WPEA did not impose new duties with respect to past transactions that were directed at regulating the primary conduct of the parties, <span class="Italic">cf. Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 347, 354 (1995) (by classifying a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination as a "personnel action," the amendment to the Whistleblower Protection Act attached new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment and enlarged the category of conduct subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) by establishing a new standard of conduct), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 96 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1996), nor did it impair rights a party possessed before its enactment. In fact, in an otherwise appealable action, the Board has considered an appellant's allegation of a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B) as a viable affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Canada v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17 (2010); <span class="Italic">Marshall v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, before the enactment of the WPEA, the Board lacked jurisdiction over such allegations raised in an IRA appeal, and therefore could not order corrective action in such cases. <span class="Italic">See Wooten v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 143, 146 (1992). As set forth above, the WPEA creates a new Board appeal right in IRA appeals for employees like the appellant who allege that a personnel action has been proposed to be taken as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), and includes a new provision directing the Board to order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate when such protected activity is a contributing factor in a personnel action. Such corrective action may include placement of the individual, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred, as well as back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and cost), and shall include attorney's fees and costs. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1). Under these circumstances, we decline to apply in this case, which was pending when the WPEA was enacted, section 101(b)(1)(A) of the WPEA as it pertains to the prohibited personnel practice set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), because doing so would increase a party's liability for past conduct as compared to pre-WPEA liability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hooker</span> was cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Hicks v. MSPB</span>, 819 F.3d 1318, 1320-23 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the board correctly determined, however, the WPEA does not apply retroactively to provide a basis for the exercise of jurisdiction over Hicks' appeal alleging that she was removed in 1990 in reprisal for filing a previous appeal. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 2015 MSPB LEXIS 8111, at *7-8; <span class="Italic">see also Miller v.

Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, 638-39 (2014) (concluding that the WPEA did not apply retroactively to supply jurisdiction over an employee's claim of reprisal for engaging in activities protected under section 2302(b)(9)). Thus, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Hicks' claim of reprisal for filing a previous board appeal falls within the scope of section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), the WPEA does not apply retroactively to provide the board with authority to review an agency removal action which occurred more than two decades before its enactment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Retroactivity is not favored in the law," and "congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result." <span class="Italic">Bowen v.

Murphy</span>, 521 U.S. 320, 328 n.4 (1997) ("[C]ases where this Court has found truly 'retroactive' effect adequately authorized by a statute have involved statutory language that was so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation."); <span class="Italic">see also Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 265 ("[t]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic."

Here, there is nothing in the text of section 101(b)(1) of the WPEA suggesting that Congress intended for its expanded appeal rights to apply to agency actions occurring long before its effective date. To the contrary, Congress specifically provided, with certain exceptions not relevant here, that the WPEA would become effective on December 27, 2012, thirty days after it was signed into law. <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA &#x00A7; 202, 126 Stat. 1476; <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 257 ("A statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."

A statement in the WPEA's legislative history suggests that at least some of its provisions could apply retroactively to cover appeals pending on or after the Act's effective date.[2] That statement, however, is insufficient, standing alone, to override the unequivocal statutory language and demonstrate a "clear intent" that the WPEA apply retroactively to provide the board with jurisdiction over agency removal actions occurring long before its enactment. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 272-73 ("Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits."); <span class="Italic">see also Chamberlain Grp., Inc. v.

Such application is expected and appropriate because the legislation generally corrects erroneous decisions by the [board] and the courts; removes and compensates for burdens that were wrongfully imposed on individual whistleblowers exercising their rights in the public interest; and improves the rules of administrative and judicial procedure and jurisdiction applicable to the vindication of whistleblowers' rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 52 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presumption against retroactive application of a statute applies with special force in situations in which such application "would have genuinely 'retroactive' effect," <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 277, i.e., where "it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 280; <span class="Italic">see also Princess Cruises v. United States</span>, 397 F.3d 1358, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (stating that retroactive application of a new law is disfavored because it upends settled expectations). Under the circumstances presented here, retroactive application of section 101(b)(1) of the WPEA would significantly increase the government's potential liability for past conduct. As discussed previously, prior to the enactment of the WPEA, the board had no authority to order corrective action in cases involving a claim of reprisal for filing a previous appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. at 639 (explaining that although prior to the WPEA the board could consider an employee's allegation of a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) as a viable affirmative defense, it "lacked jurisdiction over such allegations raised in an IRA appeal, and therefore could not order corrective action in such cases"). Under the WPEA, however, when an agency retaliates against an employee for filing a previous appeal related to whistleblowing, the board is empowered to order such corrective action as it deems appropriate, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), including restoring the employee, "as nearly as possible, [to] the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred," and awarding "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">See Rivers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously confronted--but rejected--arguments that a newly enacted statute can be applied retroactively to expand the scope of the board's jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Lapuh</span>, we held that although the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182, provided the board with jurisdiction over certain appeals alleging violations of veterans' preference rights, it did not apply retroactively to supply jurisdiction over violations occurring prior to the statute's effective date. 284 F.3d at 1280-82. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, we held that although a 1994 amendment to the WPA expanded the types of "personnel actions" over which the board could exercise jurisdiction, that amendment did not apply retroactively to provide jurisdiction over an agency action that occurred several years prior to the amendment's effective date. 96 F.3d 1367, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Here, likewise, we conclude that section 101(b)(1) of the WPEA cannot be applied retroactively to supply a predicate for the exercise of jurisdiction over Hicks' claim that the Air Force removed her in 1990 in retaliation for filing a previous appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We emphasize, however, that our holding is a narrow one. While we conclude that, under the particular circumstances presented here, section 101(b)(1) of the WPEA does not operate retroactively to supply board jurisdiction over Hicks' appeal, we express no view on whether other provisions of the WPEA can be given retroactive effect.[3] <span class="Italic">See Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280 (explaining that "there is no special reason to think that all the diverse provisions of [an] Act must be treated uniformly" for retroactivity purposes).</p>

In <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15, the Board used the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Landsgraf v.

The same rationale is applicable to the new IRA appeal right pertaining to alleged PPPs as described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) and (b)(9)(C). Indeed, as in <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, the WPEA created new Board appeal rights in IRA appeals for employees who allege that a personnel action has been taken as a result of PPPs described in section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) and (b)(9)(C), and it includes a new provision directing the Board to order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate when such protected activity is a contributing factor in a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 15.

Cir. 2015 NP), following <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, determined to be nonretroactive the provisions of the WPEA authorizing an IRA appeal based on an allegation of reprisal as a result of a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) through an appeal, complaint, or grievance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the law in effect at the time of the events at issue in this appeal, an eligible individual's entitlement to seek corrective action from the Board in an IRA appeal was limited to covered personnel actions taken or proposed to be taken as a result of a PPP described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), i.e., retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) (2011). Because the appellant only sought corrective action from OSC regarding allegations of reprisal as a result of PPPs as described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), the Board lacks IRA jurisdiction over those claims under the law in effect at the time of the events at issue. <span class="Italic">See Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1574-76.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the impact of the WPEA, if any, on the appellant's appeal. The WPEA was signed into law on November 27, 2012, and it had an effective date of December 27, 2012. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Air Force</span>, <span id="Page_3704"></span>119 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 3 (2013). With exceptions not applicable here, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), as amended by section 101(b)(1)(A) of the WPEA, an employee may seek corrective action from the Board concerning any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against him as a result of a PPP described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D).[4] Amended section 2302(b)(9)(A) provides that any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action shall not, with respect to such authority, take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee because of:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 2302(b)(9)(C) involves cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law. Section 2302(b)(9)(D) involves refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law. Neither of these subsections is implicated in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), as amended by the WPEA, and subject to the provisions of section 1221(e)(2), in any case involving an alleged PPP as described under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), "the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee...has demonstrated that a disclosure or protected activity described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15, the Board used the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Landsgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244 (1994), to determine that the retroactive application of the new IRA appeal right in section 101(b)(1)(A) of the WPEA, as it pertains to the personnel actions taken as a result of a PPP, as set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), would be impermissible because it would increase a party's liability for past conduct as compared to pre-WPEA liability. The same rationale is applicable here. Indeed, as in <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, the WPEA created a new Board appeal right in IRA appeals for employees who allege that a personnel action has been taken as a result of a PPP described in section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), and it includes a new provision directing the Board to order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate when such protected activity is a contributing factor in a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 15. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, we decline to apply in this case the new IRA appeal right in section 101(b)(1)(A) of the WPEA as it pertains to the PPPs described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) because doing so would increase a party's liability for past conduct as compared to pre-WPEA liability.[5] Thus, even assuming that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in activity that would now be considered protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), the appellant cannot bring an IRA appeal on that basis regarding events that occurred before the effective date of the WPEA.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board appeal in <span class="Italic">Hooker</span> was pending when the WPEA was enacted. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 10. Here, however, the relevant events occurred <span class="Italic">before</span> the WPEA was enacted and its effective date, but the appeal was docketed <span class="Italic">after</span> the effective date of the WPEA. This difference in chronology does not warrant a different disposition. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 11 (citing <span class="Italic">Landsgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In light of this finding, we need not reach the issue of whether the appellant's claim should be considered as a claim covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii) rather than subsection (b)(9)(A)(i).</p>

DHS</span>, SF-1221-13-0440-W-1 (NP 9/21/2015) ("Although the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA) expanded the Board's jurisdiction in IRA appeals to include claims of retaliation based on activity protected by section 2302(b)(9)(B), the WPEA did not become effective until after the agency issued the FFDE order, and the Board has held that this change in the law has no retroactive effect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hooker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15 (2014).

<p class="Body-Text">A distinction is drawn between the date of the protected activity and the date of the reprisal for retroactivity analysis, <span class="Italic">Musselman v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-1221-14-0499-W-3 (NP 6/17/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial appeal, the appellant alleged that he reported an employee's sexual harassment complaint to his Program Manager on April 5, 2011, and he prepared a memo in relation to an EEO complaint filed by another individual on October 24, 2011. The administrative judge found that those activities, (c) and (e), were not protected because they occurred prior to the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112-19, 126 Stat. 1465. On review, the appellant seems to argue otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the WPEA, which became effective on December 27, 2012, Congress expanded the grounds on which an appellant may file an IRA appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Hooker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9 (2014); WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A). Prior to the enactment of the WPEA, an appellant only could file an IRA appeal with the Board based on allegations of whistleblower reprisal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Wooten v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 143, 146 (1992), <span class="Italic">superseded by statute as stated in Carney v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 5 (2014). Following the WPEA's enactment, an appellant also may file an IRA appeal with the Board concerning alleged reprisal based on certain other classes of protected activity as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a); <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9. However, the Board has declined to give retroactive effect to the new IRA appeal rights provided under the WPEA for alleged violations of section 2302(b)(9)(A), (B), or (C). <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that (c) and (e) were not protected because both occurred prior to the enactment of the WPEA. In doing so, the administrative judge erred. The date of the purported retaliation is dispositive, not the date of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 15 (explaining that the Board would not apply the WPEA retroactively for violations of section 2302(b)(9)(B) because doing so would increase a party's liability for past conduct). Because the purported retaliation, the removal of "acting" duties and the denial of a temporary promotion, occurred in 2013, after the enactment of the WPEA, both are covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(a), 2302(b)(9)(B). We, therefore, vacate the administrative judge's findings to the contrary. Nevertheless, based on our analysis below, we find that the appellant's claim still fails.</p>
