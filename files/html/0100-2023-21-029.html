<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-29"><span class="space">4.</span> Disability Must Continue at Least One Year</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations require that a disability annuity applicant demonstrate that "[t]he disabling medical condition must be expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application for disability retirement is filed." 5 CFR 831.1203(a)(3) (2022); 5 CFR 844.103(a)(3) (2022). Restating the requirement, to be disabling, an otherwise qualifying condition must continue at least one year. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Livingstone v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 335, 339 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Angel v. OPM</span>, 122 MSPR 424, 430 &#x00B6; 11, 2015 MSPB 33 (2015) ("The appellant had no obligation to produce evidence that her disabling condition was permanent or continued until the day of the hearing, which took place 3 years after her application for disability retirement benefits. The appellant was obligated only to show that her disabling condition existed while she was employed in a position covered by FERS and was expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date of her application for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(2)-(3).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM has the authority to review a disability retirement and direct a medical examination to determine if a disability continues. <span class="Italic">McMakin v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 294, 299 (1987), explained that a prior settlement agreement with OPM (the terms were not contained in the decision) did not bar an examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute upon which appellant relies, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(c), provides that OPM shall examine a disability annuitant annually until he becomes sixty years of age, unless his disability is permanent in nature. OPM did not examine appellant annually under &#x00A7; 8337(c). Rather, in 1985, OPM exercised its discretionary authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c) to direct at any time such medical or other examinations as it considers necessary to determine the facts concerning disability of an individual receiving or applying for an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Carboneri v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 9 M.S.P.R. 520, 523 (1982). OPM has the authority to correct legally erroneous annuity payments even if the fault is OPM's. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gray v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 559, 561 (1985). OPM, further, cannot be estopped from enforcing the substantive requirements for a retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">E.g., Graef v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 676, 678 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4126"></span>The Board determines through factual analysis whether OPM is correct in its assessment of the duration of a claimed disability. Under the facts of the appeal, alcoholism did not qualify in <span class="Italic">Reddington v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 253, 256-59 (1993) (CSRS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To meet his burden of showing that he is entitled to disability retirement benefits, an employee must show that he is unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in his position and that the condition will continue for at least a year. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). The ultimate determination is based upon the probative value of all the evidence, including objective clinical findings, diagnoses and expert medical opinions, subjective evidence of disability, together with the evidence relating the effect of the appellant's condition upon his ability to perform in the grade class of positions lasts occupied <span class="Italic">See Faragon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 61, 68 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute the administrative judge's finding that he has been sober for over two years, since August 14, 1991. The administrative judge nevertheless found that, notwithstanding his having remained sober for this period, the appellant could not maintain sobriety and thus satisfactorily perform in the work place. We disagree. Despite the appellant's assertion that he might place others at risk in the future because of his alcoholism, we find that he has not shown the requisite inability to maintain control of his alcoholism, as, in fact, he has done for over two years, with a treatment regimen consistent with attendance at work. <span class="Italic">See Winslett v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 293, 296 (1986)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's claims of inability to cope with his alcoholism and with his work, as well as his worries about placing lives in danger, are conjectural. In this connection, we note that the appellant testified as to the 90 percent relapse rate of alcoholics who go through rehabilitation programs and that only 10 percent of alcoholics can avoid alcohol permanently. He has offered no evidence in support of this statement, however. The appellant further testified that, although he has dealt with legal, financial, and family problems, and attended school, taking "nautical navigation" classes since he was separated from his position, he, under no circumstances, desires to go back to his job because he now avoids all locations where, and persons who, might cause him to relapse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's testimony does not support a finding that he is unable to perform the duties of his former position. His testimony establishes that he was responsible for evaluating the performance of contractors, that he held the job for nineteen years, and that he worked under a commander or colonel in the Garden City headquarters for operations on Long Island, to assess, at a pre-award level, a contractor's ability to deliver a proposed contract. While he testified that his position was particularly stressful, we find little evidence to support such a finding. In this connection, we note that he did not have the responsibility for negotiating contracts but was involved in recommending whether a contractor would be responsible. Furthermore, he stated that he was rated "fully successful" and doing a good job at his last evaluation in April 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's psychiatrist, Dr. Crane, stated, in his September 8, 1992 psychiatric report, that the appellant "could well suffer from alcohol intoxication while on duty" which would place him "at risk to himself" and might "result in catastrophic consequences to his employer," we find that such medical opinion does not show that the duties of the appellant's position involved a high level of risk to other employees or the general public. Nor does this evidence support a finding that he was likely to start drinking again if he returned to work. We note that Dr. Crane was not the appellant's treating physician but was hired by the appellant's attorney. We further note that Dr. Crane based his medical opinion in regard to the appellant's condition on his conversations with him during three meetings. Dr. Crane testified that, based thereon, he concluded that the appellant had no physical symptoms because of his condition. Dr. Crane testified, however, that the appellant had "dysthymia," a medical term for "mild type of depression," remorse for his drinking, severely impaired judgment, and obsessive fear of returning to work and that he could not responsibly perform his job, including ordering gun parts, because of his alcoholism and depression. Dr. Crane also testified that the appellant would probably need a recovery period of several years and "was not likely to become a model citizen overnight."We find, however, that this evidence was rebutted by other record evidence, including the appellant's testimony discussed above, that he had been able to perform satisfactorily in his position without posing a significant risk to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the reasons cited by Dr. Crane to support his conclusion that the appellant was unable to perform the duties of his position are in themselves conclusory. For example, he states that the stressors involved in performing the duties of the appellant's position would result in the exacerbation of his disease, leading to maladaptive behavior changes, significant impaired judgment, and impaired social and occupational functioning. However, as we discuss above, the appellant's position was not particularly stressful and he was able to perform the duties of his position satisfactorily, despite his alcoholism. Albeit he was removed for absenteeism, there is no record evidence that such absenteeism was due to his condition. Moreover, while Dr. Crane refers to the appellant's "significant attempts at rehabilitation," which were unsuccessful, his past lack of success can hardly be deemed to preclude his successful rehabilitation and satisfactory performance, especially when he has remained sober in the face of the stressors resulting from his removal. Accordingly, we find that Dr. Crane's explanations for his conclusions are not persuasive. <span class="Italic">See Tanious v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 104, 111 (1987) (medical reports must contain reasoned explanations consistent with other evidence); <span class="Italic">Tebay v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 92, 94 (1984) (medical reports must explain how particular condition prevents employee from performing specific work requirements).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the appellant's condition does not prevent the successful performance of his duties, and we conclude that he is not physically disabled for useful and efficient service in his position. Thus, he is not entitled to disability benefit. <span class="Italic">See Faragon,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. at 71<span class="Italic">.</span> (appellant's claim of potential adverse consequences caused by stress from performing his duties was conjectural and not persuasive).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM's argument should be specific if OPM challenges medical evidence supporting the extent or duration of an appellant's disability, <span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, AT-844E-21-0191-I-1 (NP 7/7/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant bears the burden of proving her entitlement to retirement benefits by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(ii). To be eligible for disability retirement benefits under FERS, an applicant must show the following: (1) she completed at least 18 months of creditable civilian service; (2) while employed in a position subject to FERS, she became disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in a deficiency in performance, conduct or attendance, or, if there is no such deficiency, the disabling medical condition is incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position; (3) the disabling medical condition is expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date that the application for disability retirement benefits was filed; (4) accommodation of the disabling medical condition in the position held must be unreasonable; and (5) she did not decline a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a); <span class="Italic">see Thorne v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also challenges the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant satisfied the third criterion, i.e., that her disabling medical condition is expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date on which she filed her application for disability retirement. The agency, however, does not provide any specific argument in this regard. Here, the administrative judge found credible the testifying physician, a pain management specialist, who explained that "there was no current cure for the appellant's conditions," which are ongoing and progressively worsening. <span class="Italic">See Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1301. We discern no basis to disturb this finding; indeed, medical documentation in the record substantiated the physician's testimony. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant satisfied the third criterion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a condition is approved as disabling, e.g., severe dermatitis resulting from a postal worker's contact with the mails, the annuity will not be terminated when the condition improves following cessation of work if return to work would cause the condition to reoccur, <span class="Italic">Group v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Postal Service appointed the appellant to the position of Rural Letter Carrier on October 6, 1990. On July 1, 2002, the appellant filed an application for disability retirement, citing eczema caused by contact with the mail. The appellant's eczema was severe to the point that the skin on his hands would scale, blister, and peel, causing infection. The condition was very painful to the appellant and impaired his dexterity. Additionally, the accommodation which the appellant was receiving, latex gloves, was not helpful as the gloves made the condition worse due to lack of air. Additionally, the medications appellant was taking for this condition, namely a variety of corticoid steroids, caused clumsiness and other side effects permanently impacting the performance of his letter carrier duties. On January 3, 2003, OPM approved the application, and the appellant's disability retirement commenced on January 25, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 3, 2006, OPM requested that the appellant submit current employment and medical information so that OPM could assess the appellant's entitlement to a continuing disability retirement annuity. The appellant responded on November 30, 2006, stating that he had not recovered sufficiently to return to work. The appellant also enclosed a letter from his treating physician, Dr. David Wampler, who stated that a November 15, 2006 examination of the appellant was "unremarkable" and that the appellant was currently "free of his eczema." However, the letter also stated, "[T]he prognosis is that if [the appellant] were to return to work he would have a recurrence of his severe, disabling eczema. <span id="Page_4127"></span>Therefore he cannot return to the work or similar work that he previously was involved in."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 22, 2007, OPM issued an initial decision finding that the appellant's condition was no longer disabling. OPM based its decision on Dr. Wampler's assessment that the appellant was free of eczema at the time of his examination. The appellant subsequently requested that OPM reconsider its initial decision and on May 17, 2007, OPM issued a final decision affirming its initial decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRS, an individual is disabled if he suffers from a medical condition that renders him unable to provide useful and efficient service in the position he last occupied. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a); <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 480, 485 (1988); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2). OPM may subject an annuitant receiving a CSRS disability retirement annuity to an annual medical examination to determine whether his disability is continuing so as to entitle him to a continuing disability retirement annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(c)-(d); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1208. In an appeal from an OPM decision discontinuing a voluntary disability retirement annuity, the annuitant bears the burden of proving his continued disability by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Prestien v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 698, 704-05 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] . The annuitant may meet this burden by presenting evidence such as the following: (1) Objective clinical findings; (2) diagnoses and expert medical opinions; (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability; and (4) other evidence relating to the effect of the appellant's condition upon his ability to perform in the position he last occupied. <span class="Italic">See Rountree,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. at 483. The Board will find that an appellant is disabled if the appellant can show that his condition renders him unable to perform the specific work requirements of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a); <span class="Italic">Marucci v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the AJ found that the appellant had not shown that his medical condition would persist for 1 year, and she based her decision in part on that finding. OPM's decision to discontinue the appellant's disability retirement annuity was based, however, on a finding that the appellant had recovered from his disabling condition, not on a finding that the appellant's disability would not persist for 1 year. Moreover, in the absence of fraud, misstatement of fact, or new medical evidence relating to the appellant's July 1, 2002 disability retirement application, we are unaware of any authority that would have allowed OPM to discontinue the appellant's disability retirement annuity on this basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206(b)(2); <span class="Italic">cf. Longoria v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 242, 244-45 (1998) (OPM's authority to rescind a disability retirement annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System is subject to regulatory limitations). In this case, where OPM discontinued the appellant's disability retirement annuity based on a finding that the appellant had recovered from his disabling condition, the only issue before the Board is whether the appellant has shown that he is currently disabled from rendering useful and efficient service in his former position. <span class="Italic">See Rountree,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. at 483. The issue of whether the appellant's condition was expected to continue for 1 year was resolved when OPM approved the appellant's initial application for disability retirement on January 3, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her ID, the AJ cited <span class="Italic">Smith v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 465, 471 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 968 F.2d 1227 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 506 U.S. 1082 (1993), and <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 117, 121 (1988), for the proposition that an annuitant is not entitled to continuation of disability retirement benefits simply on the basis that his physical condition is unchanged since his retirement where present medical evidence does not establish that he is disabled. The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> however, was based on a medical opinion stating that the appellant in that case did not suffer from a permanent medical impairment and that, at the time of the examination, the appellant did not suffer from any medical condition that would preclude him from further employment. <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 470-71. No such medical opinion exists in this case. Similarly, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Dougherty</span> failed to submit any medical evidence showing that his persisting medical condition continued to disable him from work. <span class="Italic">See Dougherty,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. at 121. In this case, by contrast, the appellant submitted a medical opinion affirmatively stating that he "cannot return to the work or similar work that he was previously involved in. The AJ's reliance on <span class="Italic">Smith</span> and <span class="Italic">Dougherty</span> therefore is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also cited <span class="Italic">Phenious v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. 368, 371 (1983), for the proposition that the mere possibility of a future aggravation of the appellant's condition through his work duties is insufficient to justify a finding of disability. In <span class="Italic">Phenious,</span> the Board found that the appellant's medical reports did not support a finding of disability because they did not contain reasoned explanations consistent with the appellant's contention that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job. <span class="Italic">Phenious,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. at 370-71. In this case, the appellant's medical reports do contain a reasoned explanation as to why the appellant's medical condition renders him unable to perform the essential functions of his former job. The medical reports state further that, if the appellant were to return to work, the recurrence of his disabling symptoms would not be a mere possibility but rather would be a virtual certainty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the mere fact that the appellant currently lacks the symptoms of his disabling condition does not mean that the appellant has recovered from his condition or is otherwise not currently disabled. In <span class="Italic">Nash v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 11 M.S.P.R. 338, 340-342 (1982), the appellant suffered from asthma triggered by chemicals to which she was exposed in her working environment. The Board found that the appellant in that case was totally disabled from rendering useful and efficient service in her position even though her asthma was fairly well controlled through medication when she was not at work. The Board found especially persuasive the following opinion of the appellant's treating physician:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have no doubt in my mind that if [the appellant] returns to her duties and is around noxious odors such as solvents, cleaning substances, or has to engage in heavy physical activity that causes hyperventilation, she will have many more frequent exacerbations of her wheeze and respiratory distress, and will no doubt require more hospitalizations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Nash,</span> 11 M.S.P.R. at 341-42. <span class="Italic">See also Sullivan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 M.S.P.R. 25, 27 (1981) (appellant who was allergic to fungus was disabled even though he was only exposed to the fungus at work and only manifested symptoms of his allergy while at work).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Dr. Wampler's medical reports and various statements from the appellant and the appellant's supervisor establish that the appellant's eczema renders him unable to perform the work duties of a Rural Letter Carrier because it renders him unable to handle the mail. We therefore find that the appellant's medical condition prevents him from providing useful and efficient service as a Rural Letter Carrier and that the appellant continues to meet the requirements for a CSRS disability retirement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important to note, that at the time the appellant was granted disability benefits, the agency could not accommodate him, having tried gloves and other accommodations, nor can it accommodate him now. As the AJ properly noted, "[i]n seeking disability retirement benefits, the appellant must also establish that he cannot be accommodated in his letter carrier position and he is not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level in which he could render useful and efficient service." ID at 5-6, citing to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(4)-(5); <span class="Italic">Pettye v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). There is ample evidence in the record and the AJ did not rule otherwise, that the appellant could not be accommodated. (including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, statement of supervisor, Kim Weibly that "gloves are provided--but they irritate his condition due to lack of air" and that of Karen M. Henze, HR Specialist on SF 3112D that appellant could not be accommodated and that "at retirement interview hands were raw with open sores. Mr. Group had difficulty writing and handling paperwork without signs of pain.") There is nothing which has been submitted which would alter the fact that the appellant cannot be accommodated (even with gloves) or that he is not qualified for reassignment. Consequently, we find the appellant is totally disabled from performing useful and efficient service as a Rural Letter Carrier.</p>
