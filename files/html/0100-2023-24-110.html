<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-106"><span class="space">C.</span> SANCTIONS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions are for matters more serious than oversight having no effect on the administration of justice. <span class="Italic">Hodosh v. Block Drug Co.</span>, 790 F.2d 880, 882 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">In Re Violation of Rule 28(c)</span>, 388 F.3d 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[T]his court has not in the past exercised its authority to impose sanctions for 'inadvertent' violations of applicable court rules...&#8197;However, we wish to make clear that it is the duty of counsel to familiarize themselves with applicable rules, and that, in future cases, serious violations of applicable rules, whether or not 'inadvertent,' will potentially subject counsel to sanctions."). Sanctions are imposed for the filing and prosecution of a frivolous appeal. How does one determine that an appeal is frivolous? To paraphrase one authority, frivolity by one side is suggested by a case that cannot possibly be lost, no matter what the advocate's ineptitude, or that cannot be won, no matter what the advocate's skill. More objectively, the frivolous case presents no possible basis for reversal in law or in fact. In <span class="Italic">Dreamlite Holdings Ltd. v. Kraser</span>, 890 F.2d 1147, 1149 (Fed. Cir. 1989), the court observed: "Fully aware of the seriousness of that appellation [frivolousness], we have looked in vain for even a colorable basis on which it could be said that the appeal had some chance of success or involved a good faith effort to change the law." Nevertheless, the lines are not clear cut. The appellate process is a component of the constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances. Disciplinary rules governing lawyers call for zealous advocacy; those rules contemplate good <span id="Page_5325"></span>faith argument by counsel for a change in the existing law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least between private litigants in the Federal Circuit, "[a]n allegation of a frivolous appeal should not be made cavalierly....&#8197;'[U]nfounded requests for sanctions are themselves frivolous and sanctionable.'" <span class="Italic">Nordberg v. Telsmith, Inc.</span>, 82 F.3d 394, 398 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quoting <span class="Italic">Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp.</span>, 970 F.2d 834, 835 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1992)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Schendel v. Curtis</span>, 83 F.3d 1399, 1406 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("A baseless sanctions motion unfairly forces an opponent into satellite litigation while diverting attention away from the real issues in a case. It also unjustly challenges the integrity of the accused party and the professionalism of its counsel, and it wastes judicial resources. Assertion that an appeal is frivolous should be based on clear-cut grounds, not tenuous argument."). Rather than become involved in litigation over sanctions, the government can move for summary affirmation, granted "when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists." <span class="Italic">Trobovic v. GSA</span>, 345 Fed. Appx. 584, 585 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (citing <span class="Italic">Joshua v. United States,</span> 17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir. 1994), and not precluding a motion for summary affirmation by an appellant); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Myco Industries, Inc. v. Blexphex, LLC</span>, 955 F.3d 1, 15 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ("Speech is not to be enjoined lightly.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The filing and prosecution of a clearly frivolous appeal constitutes an unnecessary and unjustifiable burden on courts; diminishes the opportunity for careful, unpressured consideration of nonfrivolous appeals; and delays access to the courts for persons with truly deserving causes. Under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a court may assess costs and fees in favor of the government and against the appellant and his counsel to penalize a frivolous appeal. <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the process leading to sanctions, on December 1, 1994, amendments to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure modified Rule 38 to permit imposition of damages and costs for frivolous appeals only after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and a reasonable opportunity to respond. The Advisory Committee on Federal Appellate Rules stated in the Note accompanying the amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amendment requires that before a court of appeals may impose sanctions, the person to be sanctioned must have notice and an opportunity to respond. The amendment reflects the basic principle enunciated in the Supreme Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper</span>, 447 U.S. 752, 767 (1980), that notice and opportunity to respond must precede the imposition of sanctions. A separately filed motion requesting sanctions constitutes notice. A statement inserted in a party's brief that the party moves for sanctions is not sufficient notice. Requests in briefs for sanctions have become so commonplace that it is unrealistic to expect careful responses to such requests without any indication that the court is actually contemplating such measures. Only a motion, the purpose of which is to request sanctions, is sufficient. If there is no such motion filed, notice must come from the court. The form of notice from the court and of the opportunity for comment purposely are left to the court's discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the amendments, Rule 38 permitted imposition of sanctions without the necessity of a separately filed motion from a party or notice from the court. It had been the practice within the Federal Circuit to adjudicate sanctions on the basis of suggestions of frivolity (and responses to those suggestions) contained in the parties' briefs<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Romala Corp. v. United States</span>, 927 F.2d 1219 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co.</span>, 926 F.2d 1574, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (when a request for sanctions was made in opposing party's brief and during oral argument, "due process does not require any additional notice or opportunity to be heard prior to imposition of Rule 38 sanctions").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 46(c) provides another basis for the imposition of sanctions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Discipline</span>. A court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule. First, however, the court must afford the attorney reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The issue raised in <span class="Italic">Toepfer v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 792 F.2d 1102, 1102-03 (Fed. Cir. 1986), was whether frivolous appeals supported the imposition of fines against attorneys under Rule 38, without a due process hearing, or under Rule 46(c), requiring a hearing. In an order written by Judge Nies, the court decided that a due process hearing was not required:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Movants assert that pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 46(c), they are entitled to a specific notice of the imposition of disciplinary action and are entitled to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. Rule 46(c) has no applicability to the imposition of damages and costs under Rule 38. Rule 46(c) relates to disciplinary action against an attorney "for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with these rules or any rule of the court."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The damages and costs assessed against counsel were for bringing a frivolous appeal, not as a disciplinary action for conduct unbecoming an attorney or for violation of the federal rules or rules of the court. Rule 38 provides that, if the appeal is frivolous, damages and costs <span class="Italic">may</span> be assessed. To require a hearing for the assessment of such damages and costs would impose on the opposing party and on the court an even greater burden in dealing with a frivolous appeal and entirely defeat the purpose of Rule 38. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hyde v. Van Wormer</span>, 106 S. Ct. 403 (1985) (Supreme Court awarded damages under its Rule 49.2 without a hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel also assert that they "are non-parties against whom an award of charges has been entered and as such due process requires this counsel be permitted to be heard." Counsel are within the scope of Rule 38. <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 769 F.2d 753, 754-56 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Asberry v. United States Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (joint and several liability with client); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Reid v. United States</span>, 715 F.2d 1148, 1155 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">TIF Instrument, Inc. v. Collette</span>, 713 F.2d 197, 201 (6th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">United States v. Potamkin Cadillac Corp</span>, 689 F.2d 379, 382 (2d Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (joint and several liability with client). Counsels' assertion of a constitutional violation by failure to provide a hearing is an attack on the rule itself. In view of the above-cited precedent and the perfunctory assertion of constitutional error, we see no merit in this argument.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">In re Perry</span>, 918 F.2d 931, 935-36 (Fed. Cir. 1990), reaffirmed the availability of sanctions without hearings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perry further requests an evidentiary hearing on a series of what he describes as "issues":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Due Process</span>. The requirements of due process are Notice and Opportunity to be Heard....&#8197;Perry received both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Notice</span>. Practitioners in this court are expected to know and follow the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the precedents in the court's published jurisprudence. Rule 38 provides for sanctioning frivolous appeals. From an early date, this court has indicated that it will not hesitate to apply sanctions against parties and their counsel in appropriate cases,...and has in fact imposed such sanctions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, Amerace expressly stated in its brief that it was seeking attorney's fees pursuant to Rule 38 and 28 USC 1927, which specifically relates to counsel's personal liability for excess costs. Such a request in a brief satisfies the notice requirements of due process....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Opportunity to be Heard</span>. This court provides those charged by an adversary with frivolity an opportunity to be heard and expects those on notice to avail themselves of that opportunity. An adversarial, evidentiary hearing is not required....&#8197;The court's published Practice Note to Rule 38 states "a party whose case has been challenged as frivolous is expected to respond to the challenge in the reply brief or to voluntarily request dismissal of the case." Though the court supplied that Practice Note to Perry, he did not respond to Amerace's challenge and did not request dismissal. On the contrary, he exhibited indifference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rules 38 and 46(c)</span>....&#8197;Contrary to Perry's creative interpretation of two recent Supreme Court opinions, the "hearing" requirements of Rule 46(c) have not been incorporated into Rule 38....&#8197;This court has specifically held that Rule 46(c) has no applicability to the imposition of damages and costs under Rule 38. <span class="Italic">Toepfer v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, 792 F.2d 1102 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal may be frivolous as filed or as argued, <span class="Italic">Pirri v. Cheek</span>, 851 Fed. Appx. 183, 188-89 (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">..."Frivolous appeals waste both the public resources supplied to this court and the resources of prevailing litigants that must defend such frivolous actions." <span class="Italic">Walker v. Health Int'l Corp</span>., 845 F.3d 1148, 1156 (Fed. Cir. 2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal may be frivolous as filed or as argued. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1154. "[A]n appeal is frivolous as filed when the judgment by the tribunal below was so plainly correct and the legal authority contrary to appellant's position so clear that there really is no appealable issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "[A]n appeal is frivolous as argued when the appellant's misconduct in arguing the appeal justifies such a holding." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotation omitted). "Such misconduct can include manufacturing arguments by distorting the record, by disregarding or mischaracterizing the clear authority against its position, and by attempting to draw illogical deductions from the facts and the law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotation omitted). When an appeal is frivolous as argued, we may hold a party's counsel jointly and severally liable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1157.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a party blindly disregards long-established authority and raises arguments with no factual foundation, the judicial process has not been used, but abused, and sanctions under Rule 38 are warranted. <span class="Italic">Octocom Sys. v. Houston Computer Serv., Inc.</span>, 918 F.2d 937 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Arunachalam v.

Cir. 1991) (concerning sanctions for frivolous appeal in a case otherwise responsibly litigated; the court set $5,000 as the figure to cover fees in order to avoid further litigation over the exact amount of the penalty). Sanctions of $500 in fines were imposed against counsel and his client in <span class="Italic">Moir <span id="Page_5326"></span>v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 754 F.2d 341, 343 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The petitioner sought reinstatement of an appeal 16 months after a reinstatement application should have been made. To prevail, the petitioner had to show that the Board abused its discretion by refusing to permit the reactivation of the case. Finding that the petitioner "has offered no possible justification for that substantial delay," only "a case of inexcusable neglect in making a timely filing," the court affirmed the Board's dismissal, adding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal in this case was frivolous. As noted, the petitioner's initial argument rested upon a misstatement of the date on which he refiled his appeal with the Board. In any event, there was no plausible basis upon which the dismissal of the appeal as untimely could be deemed erroneous or an abuse of discretion. Accordingly we assess costs and attorney's fees of five hundred dollars in favor of the government jointly and severally against Mr. Moir and his attorney....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed a reprimand, imposed by the Court of International Trade against a government attorney, for incomplete or arguably misleading citation of authority by counsel in a brief. <span class="Italic">Precision Specialty Metals, Inc. v. United States</span>, 315 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Costs and attorney fees of $500 were imposed in <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 365 (Fed. Cir. 1985), against counsel and his client who presented what the court felt was a frivolous appeal involving an attempt to set aside an involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Des Vignes v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 791 F.2d 142, 146 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ($1,000); <span class="Italic">Cecil v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 767 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ($500 sanction against the appellant and his counsel, jointly and severally, for a frivolous appeal that was "filed or proceeded with in this court"); <span class="Italic">Kump v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 767 F.2d 889, 892 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ($500 awarded in costs and counsel fees against a lawyer and client who argued points previously rejected by the court or who made arguments wholly devoid of merit). It is noteworthy that although the Federal Circuit makes extensive use of unpublished opinions, the air traffic controller sanction cases were often published, although they added nothing to the law; the effect of publicly naming counsel who are fined is doubtless as severe or more severe a sanction than imposition of the fine.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions are not limited to monetary fines. An attorney was suspended from practicing before the Federal Circuit for one year. The attorney was sanctioned for maintaining appeals that the court characterized as frivolous in over 100 air traffic controller cases. <span class="Italic">In re Solerwitz</span>, 848 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1988). If the court is convinced that sanctions would be useless to deter a multitude of filings from a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, it may advise the government that it need not respond to any future papers filed by the individual unless specifically directed by the court to do so. <span class="Italic">Wright v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3372); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bergman v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 3 F.3d 432, 435 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (clerk was directed not to file further papers by the petitioner without "first referring them to a judge of the court who will determine whether the same claims have been adjudged before and if so will reject them for filing. Respondent may comment on the proposed filing at the judge's discretion").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Federal Circuit does not yet appear to have fined government counsel, it came close. An issue in one appeal was whether the appellant was improperly denied discovery. Government counsel mistakenly argued that the issue had not been raised before the Board. It clearly had. The court concluded in <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2624):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's waiver argument, lacking a factual foundation, is irresponsible and indicates negligence on the part of counsel in reviewing the record before the Board....&#8197;[A] cursory review of the petition would have disclosed that the discovery issue was presented to the Board. This failure to convey accurately the proceedings below is an imposition on the court and has added unnecessarily to our workload. Under these circumstances, denial to the government of its costs herein is more than warranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Snow v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 93-3463), OPM's counsel was chided but not sanctioned for presenting a frivolous defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Snow indicated in his reply brief, the record plainly establishes that this Court received Snow's petition for review on July 12, 1993. The date of docketing is not the date of filing. As members of our bar and seasoned litigators before this Court, the attorneys representing OPM should be fully aware of the difference. A call to the Clerk's Office would have established that there was no basis for a jurisdictional argument based on the untimeliness of appeal. OPM's counsel could and should have confirmed the correct dates before making the argument. Petitioner should not have been required to respond to a baseless argument. In the future, attorneys for OPM are directed to make routine inquiries before burdening a petitioner with the additional time and expense of generating a response to meritless contentions on timeliness. Further, the court should not be burdened with the need to consider opposing briefs and confirm independently what the facts are. Counsel are obligated to withdraw any issue from consideration as soon as they know the issue is unsupportable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pro se</span> litigants can be subject to sanctions, <span class="Italic">Winsett v. McDonald</span>, 611 Fed. Appx. 710, 714 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having access to the courts to vindicate one's legal rights is a hallmark of our judicial system. Yet given Ms. Winsett's litigation history, we caution that any further appeals re-challenging issues decided here, or in any of this court's prior eleven decisions, may subject her to sanctions. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that "[i]f a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee." This is because "[a] frivolous appeal imposes costs not only upon the party forced to defend it, but also upon the public whose taxes supporting this court and its staff are wasted on frivolous appeals." <span class="Italic">Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co</span>., 926 F.2d 1574, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that this court's authority to allow petitioners to proceed <span class="Italic">in forma pauperis</span> is discretionary in nature. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1915(a)(1). While we recognize the importance of making such petitions available to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants, "[i]t is vital that the right to file <span class="Italic">in forma pauperis</span> not be incumbered by those who would abuse the integrity of our process by frivolous filings." <span class="Italic">Zatko v. California</span>, 502 U.S. 16 (1991) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">In re Amendment to Rule 39</span>, 500 U.S. 13, 13 (1991)) (quotation marks omitted). Given Ms. Winsett's repetitive filings at this court and the below tribunals, we advise that any additional applications to proceed <span class="Italic">in forma pauperis</span> should be subject to additional scrutiny or, in the alternative, subject to an order to show cause why the petition for review should not be dismissed as frivolous. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1915(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some sizzling passages of Federal Circuit case law are devoted to sanctions, one example taken from <span class="Italic">Laitram Corp. v. Cambridge Wire Cloth Co.</span>, 919 F.2d 1579, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel for neither side appears willing, even when cautioned, to understand and follow the rules governing the appellate process. Showing no mercy on this busy court, they first filed briefs so replete with cross-charges of misstatements and so lacking in record references as to frustrate the desire of this court to trust its officers in this case. The court was thus compelled to decline the burden of checking each statement and to reject those briefs....&#8197;Continuing a kind of "Alice in Patentland" approach to the judicial process, the parties' conduct then grew "curiouser and curiouser," for their new briefs include: statements of fact with no record reference; statements of fact for which there is no record; reliance on attorney argument and counsel's unsworn fact statements as "evidence"; citation of materials and raising of questions as though they were before the district court when the present record indicates they were not; assertions of and reliance on facts that occurred after entry of the judgment appealed from; irreconcilably conflicting positions of the same party; citation of inapplicable authorities;...disregard of the concerns expressed by this court at oral argument; and a refusal to come to grips with the questions propounded by this court. Far from aiding this court to decide, by presenting legal arguments on concrete fact patterns, counsel have in this case wasted this court's resources by playing in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society. In sum, the parties' briefs and arguments on this appeal serve not to seek but to obfuscate the truth.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appealability of a sanction imposed by a lower court was considered in <span class="Italic">Tesco Corp. v. National Oilwell Varco</span>, 804 F.3d 1367, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2015), the majority determining that the appeal could not be considered because the parties settled with full releases, leaving no case or controversy. Judge Newman dissented, arguing the sanction was not moot: "A lawyer's reputation is the lawyer's most valuable asset."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What can be done to avoid sanctions? Neither the court nor most Justice Department attorneys seek to penalize attorneys who are zealous in the prosecution of legitimate appeals. Within the limits of rational and civil advocacy of one's position, "opposing attorneys are expected to disagree concerning the merits of their cases." <span class="Italic">Nordberg v. Telsmith, Inc.</span>, 82 F.3d 394, 398 (Fed. Cir. 1996). What is of concern to the court is the large volume of civil service cases raising issues that are effectively foreclosed by its scope of review. Counsel who prepare reply briefs that ignore controlling case law cited in the government brief invite criticism by the court. As good a way as any to avoid sanctions is to let another lawyer consider the case and tell you whether the appeal seems reasonable. If the government challenges your appeal as frivolous, consider whether the suggestion of frivolity is correct and if it is not, fully rebut the suggestion. Be specific in your explanation of why the case merits appeal and how you researched the issues or otherwise considered the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning the conduct of personnel litigation by government counsel earlier it was mentioned that it does not appear that the Federal Circuit has yet sanctioned government counsel, although there has been more than one frivolous argument advanced and more than one erroneous record reference by government counsel more interested in winning a case than fairly arguing it. Government counsel are urged to heed the admonition in <span class="Italic">Freeport-McMoran Oil &#x0026; Gas Co. v. FERC</span>, 962 F.2d 45, 47-48 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We understand that what seems obvious in hindsight might not have occurred at the time to a busy agency lawyer. We do not understand, however, FERC counsel's repeated insistence at oral argument that he had no obligation at all to take any of the steps we have mentioned. "I don't think we had to do that," counsel said in response to a suggestion that a phone call to opposing counsel might have put an end to the <span id="Page_5327"></span>case; "the burden is on him." When a member of the panel submitted that counsel for a public agency has special obligations, FERC's counsel replied that "I think we can agree to disagree on that point." At the close of oral argument, FERC's counsel summed up his position: "All I can say is that I think you're holding us to a different standard here."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notion that government lawyers have obligations beyond those of private lawyers did not originate in oral argument in this case. A government lawyer "is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy," the Supreme Court said long ago in a statement chiseled on the walls of the Justice Department, "but of a sovereignty whose obligation...is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done." <span class="Italic">Berger v. United States</span>, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S. Ct. 629, 633, 79 L. Ed. 1314 (1935). The Supreme Court was speaking of government prosecutors in <span class="Italic">Berger</span>, but no one, to our knowledge (at least prior to oral argument), has suggested that the principle does not apply with equal force to the government's civil lawyers. In fact, the American Bar Association's Model Code of Professional Responsibility expressly holds a "government lawyer in a civil action or administrative proceeding" to higher standards than private lawyers, stating that government lawyers have "the responsibility to seek justice," and "should refrain from instituting or continuing litigation that is obviously unfair." Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 7-14 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Government lawyers, we have no doubt, should also refrain from continuing litigation that is obviously pointless, that could easily be resolved, and that wastes Court time and taxpayer money. "[T]he United States," as President Bush stated in an Executive Order, "sets an example for private litigation by adhering to higher standards than those required by the rules of procedure in the conduct of Government litigation in Federal court." Executive Order on Civil Justice Reform, 27 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1485 (October 23, 1991). The Executive Order, designed in part "to reduce needless litigation," requires government attorneys to attempt to settle cases whenever possible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although we express no views on the applicability of the Executive Order to counsel for administrative agencies, and although we think a government lawyer's obligation to avoid needless litigation precedes the Executive Order, the Order plainly propounds the very proposition FERC's counsel challenged at oral argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find it astonishing that an attorney for a federal administrative agency could so unblushingly deny that a government lawyer has obligations that might sometimes trump the desire to pound an opponent into submission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Byrum v. OPM</span>, 618 F.3d 1323, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (the responsibility of Justice Department lawyers is to do justice, not just to win cases).</p>
