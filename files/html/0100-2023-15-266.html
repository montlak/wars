<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-264"><span class="space">b.</span> Significance of Custody and Control of Property</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Mitigation of removal is inappropriate, even when the item taken is of <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> value, if the item was within the custody and control of the employee or when the agency has a compelling interest in deterring the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Betz v. GSA</span>, 55 MSPR 424, 432 (1992) (theft of $335, not considered <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span>, by an imprest fund cashier; there was a lack of potential for rehabilitation). Removal was appropriate for the unauthorized possession by a commissary worker of approximately $14 of groceries in <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1984). <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984), was distinguished because <span class="Italic">Miguel</span> involved an automatic penalty of removal for a theft-related offense, demonstrating disregard of the need to assess every case on its particular facts. DeWitt was dismissed after a responsible balancing of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors; further, DeWitt was responsible for control and custody of the items he took; Miguel was not. In Miguel's case, the agency regulations apparently required the penalty to have some relation to the value of the item taken, a restriction absent in DeWitt's appeal. Miguel admitted and repented the charged misconduct; DeWitt denied the wrongdoing--a denial the Board concluded was fabricated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comparing and contrasting <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span> and <span class="Italic">Miguel</span>, <span class="Italic">Underwood v. DOD</span>, 53 MSPR 355, 359-61 (1992), sustained removal for attempted theft of two jars of cinnamon by a material handler:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the Board and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have held that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of a theft may be a significant mitigating factor, where the appellant otherwise has a satisfactory work and disciplinary record. Under certain circumstances, however, mitigation is inappropriate even for <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft. Mitigation has been found to be inappropriate when the item stolen is within the custody and control of an employee. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of the Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (employee who worked stocking shelves in commissary removed for taking $14.00 worth of groceries), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S. Ct. 1759, 84 L. Ed.2d 822 (1985); <span class="Italic">Toone v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 262 (1988) (nurse's removal warranted for taking 10 Darvoset tablets); <span class="Italic">Hunt v. US Postal Service</span>, 29 MSPR 246 (1985), and cases cited therein (letter carrier discharged for removing uncanceled stamps).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span>, the Court specifically distinguished <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The court stated that because DeWitt stocked the commissary shelves, the grocery items he stole were within his custody and control while Miguel, who was a commissary cashier, was in a position of control with respect to cash but not with respect to the items she took from the salvage shelves in the commissary manager's office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of the Navy</span> at 1447. The instant case is similar to <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span> because there is no dispute that the items the appellant pilfered were items that she was responsible for loading and, thus, came within her custody and control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that, while the appellant's performance appraisals were satisfactory, the deciding official testified at length concerning the appellant's problems over the last two to three years. She testified, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that she had counseled the appellant regarding sleeping on the job, attendance, loafing, and taking too many breaks. The deciding official also testified that she took action against the appellant's immediate supervisor because he was not performing his job, and that if he had been performing it correctly, the appellant would not have received a satisfactory performance rating. In light of the uncontroverted testimony that there were performance problems, even though the appellant's performance ratings were satisfactory, we do not find that the satisfactory ratings weigh in favor of mitigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we agree with the agency's assertion in its petition for review that there is no basis for concluding that the appellant was a good candidate for rehabilitation. The administrative judge did not explain his reasons for his findings that the appellant was remorseful <span id="Page_2792"></span>and a good candidate for rehabilitation. We find nothing in the record tending to show that the appellant was remorseful or able to rehabilitate herself. In fact, the record evidence indicates the contrary. The appellant testified that she believed the agency was "blowing it [the theft] out of proportion," and answered "no" when asked if she had ever done anything like the theft before. She then answered "no" to the question of whether she pled guilty to shoplifting in 1988; yet after further questioning, she admitted it reluctantly, saying "yes, if it's on there" [the record]. Thus, while the appellant admitted to the theft prior to the hearing, in the absence of other evidence, we do not find that she was remorseful or necessarily a good candidate for rehabilitation. In so finding, we also note the deciding official's testimony that she had tried to help the appellant for several years, that she did not believe the appellant could be trusted, and that she did not believe the appellant should continue in her job where she had access to pilferable materials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that the administrative judge correctly concluded that because the agency did not include the appellant's past disciplinary record, a reprimand and a suspension, in its notice proposing her removal, the agency deciding official improperly considered them in deciding to remove the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. US Postal Service</span>, 50 MSPR 41, 45 (1991). We do not agree with the administrative judge, however, that the deciding official's erroneous consideration of the appellant's past record warrants mitigation. The appellant has not shown to date what evidence or argument she would have proffered had she known that her prior past record was being considered in assessing the penalty, and how that evidence would have affected the reasonableness of the penalty. Moreover, on the record before us, without considering the past record, the penalty of removal is within the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 42 MSPR 467, 478 (1989) (agency deciding official's improper reliance on the appellant's past disciplinary record and subsequent erroneous reliance by the administrative judge constituted error, but the removal penalty was reasonable under all of the circumstances of the case)....&#8197;The only mitigating factors are the appellant's 15 years of employment, and the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft. We find that they are outweighed by the appellant's recent performance problems and the seriousness of the offense in light of her custody and control over the stolen items. Thus, we find no basis on which to disturb the agency's choice of penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "custody and control" analysis was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Kirk v. DLA</span>, 59 MSPR 523, 527-28 (1993), mitigating removal to a 90-day suspension for theft of six square feet of rubber matting with a retail value of less than $5:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the administrative judge erred by considering as a mitigating factor the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> value of the item taken because, regardless of whether the matting in question was within the appellant's custody and control, he had "unlimited access to it in the normal course of his duties." The <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> value of the item taken is a mitigating factor where the employee did not occupy a position entailing custody and control over the item. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of the Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1054 (1985); <span class="Italic">Underwood v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the agency's contention, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have distinguished between an employee's merely having "access" to the item he took and his occupying a position of custody and control over the item because, in the latter situation, the "breach of trust is difficult to repair." <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span>, 747 F.2d at 1445; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Underwood</span>, 53 MSPR at 359. In <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span>, the Federal Circuit held that an employee whose job was stocking commissary shelves occupied a position of custody and control over the groceries he took, and distinguished <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1083-84 (Fed. Cir. 1984), on the basis that, there, the employee was a commissary cashier who occupied a "position of control with respect to the cash in the register, but not with respect to the items she took from a cabinet in the manager's office." <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span>, 747 F.2d at 1445. In <span class="Italic">Underwood</span>, 53 MSPR at 359, the Board held that the employee occupied a position of custody and control over the two jars of cinnamon she took because it was her job to load those items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant and other employees had unlimited access to the scrap matting in question but that the matting was not entrusted to the appellant's care and responsibility as part of his job duties. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant did not occupy a position of custody and control over the matting and that, therefore, the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> value of the item taken constitutes a mitigating factor....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board once again addressed the custody and control issue, <span class="Italic">Lovenduski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 612, 616-17 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, the administrative judge found that, because the appellant is an electronics worker and is responsible for using the agency's tools in the normal performance of his duties, the appellant had custody and control over the mandrel and saws. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have distinguished between an employee's merely having "access" to the item he took and his occupying a position of custody and control over the item because, in the latter situation, the "breach of trust is difficult to repair." <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of the Navy,</span> 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1054 (1985); <span class="Italic">Kirk v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 59 MSPR at 527. For example, when an individual is in a position that requires him to stock grocery shelves or unload specific items, that person is in a position of custody and control over those items. <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span>, 747 F.2d at 1445; <span class="Italic">Underwood v. Department of Defense,</span> 53 MSPR 355, 359, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). In contrast, when an employee is a cashier, that employee occupies a position of control with respect to the money in the cash register, but the employee does not have control over the items in her manager's office<span class="Italic">. Miguel v. Department of the Army,</span> 727 F.2d 1081, 1083-84 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the mandrel and hole saws were not necessary for the performance of the appellant's position. Thus, the tools were not entrusted to the appellant's care and responsibility as part of his job duties. Furthermore, even though the appellant had "access" to these tools, he was still required to check the tools out at the tool crib. Thus, we find that the appellant did not have "control and custody" over the mandrel and hole saws as found by the administrative judge. Therefore, the administrative judge should have given the small value of the tools more weight as a mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chin v. DOD</span>, 2022 MSPB 34, &#x00B6; 30 (2022) (Member Limon dissenting), mitigated removal to a suspension of 90 days when the appellant removed a small amount of food from an agency cafeteria without payment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although not addressed by the deciding official or the administrative judge, another mitigating factor in this case is that the appellant did not have custody or control over the stolen items as part of his official duties. Our reviewing court and the Board have treated this as a significant mitigating factor in cases involving <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft, including cases in which the appellant occupied a position of trust. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miguel</span>, 727 F.2d at 1082, 1084 (remanding for a determination of a lesser penalty after concluding that removal was too harsh for a commissary cashier who took two bars of soap valued at $2.10); <span class="Italic">Skates</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 368-69 (mitigating a removal to a 14-day suspension for the appellant's theft of left-over food of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> value from the dining room where he worked when there was no specific evidence that he was in control over the food that he took); <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 590, 592-93 &#x0026; n.1 (1995) (mitigating to a 30-day suspension the demotion of a shipfitter foreman for the unauthorized possession and attempted removal of scrap metal valued at $2.60 because, among other things, the appellant did not have custody and control over the property as part of his official duties); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 358, 359, 362-63 (1990) (mitigating to a 90-day suspension the removal of a claims representative who was convicted of off-duty shoplifting, finding that the items she took did not come into her possession as a result of her position). Conversely, the Board and our reviewing court have found that mitigating the agency's chosen penalty for <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft is inappropriate when the employee gained control over the stolen item as a direct result of his position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DeWitt v. Department of the Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (sustaining a commissary worker's removal for taking $14.00 worth of groceries because "[w]here the employee takes unauthorized personal possession of property entrusted to his care and responsibility, the breach of trust is difficult to repair"); <span class="Italic">Underwood</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. at 359 (sustaining a material worker's removal for the attempted theft of two jars of cinnamon that she was responsible for loading and, thus, came within her custody and control).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Banez v. DOD</span>, 69 MSPR 642, 650 (1996), expanded on the distinction between custody and control and access when the Board assesses the significance of petty theft or misappropriation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have held that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of a theft may be a significant mitigating factor where the appellant has a satisfactory work and disciplinary record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d at 1083; <span class="Italic">Underwood v. Department of Defense,</span> 53 MSPR 355, 359 &#x0026; n.4, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Here the appellant served satisfactorily in the military for 20 years until he retired, and had served for almost 6 years in his position with the Commissary. There is no evidence that he was other than a fully satisfactory employee and he had no past disciplinary record. Thus, the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft is a significant mitigating factor here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the administrative judge, in sustaining the removal penalty, relied on <span class="Italic">Underwood,</span> where the Board declined to mitigate the removal of a Material Handler, WG-5, for the theft of two jars of cinnamon, we believe this case is distinguishable. The jars of cinnamon were found to be wholly within appellant Underwood's custody and control, and Underwood had <span id="Page_2793"></span>had performance problems for 2 to 3 years prior to the theft. Here, while produce was within the appellant's direct custody and control, the Tide was not. <span class="Italic">See DeWitt v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (because DeWitt stocked the commissary shelves, the grocery items (worth $14.00) he stole were within his custody and control, thus justifying removal), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S. Ct. 1759, 84 L. Ed.2d 822 (1985). <span class="Italic">But see Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d at 1083 (the court held that where Miguel was a commissary cashier, the two bars of soap she stole from salvage shelves in the commissary manager's office were not directly within her custody and control, only the cash she handled was, and mitigation was warranted). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lovenduski v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 MSPR 612, 616-17 (1994) (where the Board distinguishes between mere "access" and custody and control, because the latter situation involves a more severe breach of trust).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hammonds v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-10-0399-I-1 (NP 8/31/2011), alluded to custody and control of property removed without authorization:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the appellant's lengthy service and the minimal value of the items he removed without authorization are significant. However, in this case, they are outweighed by other serious considerations. As discussed above, the appellant's autonomy in the workplace put him in a position to take trash or other items, such as the folders and composition book. He was clearly on notice that it was improper to do so, yet he took items without authorization twice in 1 year (in May and again in November). Given the appellant's repeated misconduct in such a short span of time, we agree that the agency did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the appellant could not be trusted and lacked potential for rehabilitation. Under these circumstances, the penalty of removal does not exceed the bounds of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Consumption of some leftovers not under a cook's control did not warrant removal in <span class="Italic">Skates v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 366, 368-70 (1996) (following remand from Federal Circuit, 60 F.3d 843 (Fed. Cir. 1995), remanding 66 MSPR 135, 135 (1995)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The penalty for employee misconduct is generally left to agency discretion, but a penalty which is grossly disproportionate to the offense, in light of particular circumstances of the case, is an abuse of such discretion. <span class="Italic">Casias v. Department of the Army,</span> 62 MSPR 130, 132 (1994). In this case, the agency's table of penalties provides a range of penalties from a fourteen-day suspension to removal for theft. It also states that the "penalty depends upon such factors as the value of the property involved, and the nature of the position held by an offending employee, which may dictate a higher standard of conduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has admitted his misconduct. He took a portion of left-over food from a dining room where he worked to another job where he worked on the same military installation. At the second job, he ate part of the food and shared the rest with his co-workers. While the value of the left-over food that was taken is unclear, it is undisputed that the value is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and the courts have long held that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> value of stolen items is a factor to be considered in a penalty determination depending upon the "unique circumstances of each case." <span class="Italic">See Miguel</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Army,</span> 727 F.2d 1081, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Miguel</span>, the employee was charged with taking two bars of soap valued at $2.10 over which she had no control, and the court found that removal was disproportionate to the offense. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of the Navy,</span> 747 F.2d 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S. Ct. 1759, 84 L. Ed.2d 822 (1985), the court sustained the removal of an employee for stealing groceries worth $14.00 which were under his control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge reasoned that under <span class="Italic">DeWitt,</span> the appellant was in control of the food which he cooked. However, there is no evidence that the appellant had control over the specific food that he took from the mess hall. Indeed, the Court of Appeals held that those in the mess hall had no control and custody of these leftovers since the food had been transferred to those in the recreation hall. Without such evidence, the appellant's position is more like the employee in <span class="Italic">Miguel</span> than the one in <span class="Italic">DeWitt.</span> Therefore, the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft is a factor in the penalty determination here as it was in <span class="Italic">Miguel</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are other mitigating factors, including some which there is no evidence that the administrative judge considered. The appellant is an honorably discharged veteran who was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal. He has seventeen years of service with the agency, ten of which were working as a cook. During this lengthy employment, he received ratings that were exceptional, fully successful, and highly successful. He also received a cash award for sustained superior performance. Furthermore, just a year earlier than his removal by the agency, he received a commendation from his supervisor on March 16, 1993, which praised him for his assistance, dedication, and professionalism--the appellant had walked through the snow during the March, 1993 blizzard, when all roads were closed to traffic and most employees were unable to make it to work, to prepare meals during a two-day period for the cadets, and he volunteered to work a double tour of duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant had only one prior disciplinary action taken against him during his entire service with the agency. This occurred over five years before this incident, when he was given a one-day suspension for being involved in a 1988 shoving match in which he was the victim and was provoked. The nature of that misconduct is so different from the charge in this case that it significantly diminishes the weight of that prior discipline in the calculation of a proper penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the basis of these considerations, we find that the penalty of removal is disproportionate to the offense charged and that mitigation is appropriate under the circumstances. In determining the appropriate penalty in this case, we have considered that the court expressly referred to the agency's table of penalties for theft, which depends on such factors as "the value of property involved, and the nature of the position held by an offending employee, which may dictate a higher standard of conduct." We have also considered that the court found the following: (1) The value of the property involved was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>; (2) the appellant was not in control of the items stolen and thus did not hold a position which dictated a higher standard of conduct; (3) the one past instance of disciplinary action should have been given little, if any, weight in considering the removal penalty; and (4) the appellant's employment record, which included an incident of exceptional devotion to duty and an award for sustained superior performance is a significant mitigating factor. Here, the table of penalties begins with a fourteen-day suspension. We find that, under the circumstances of this case, this lowest of penalties is appropriate. Accordingly, we find that a fourteen-day suspension is the appropriate penalty for the sustained misconduct....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Theft of two bottles of garlic salt and one bottle of penicillin tablets by a cook foreman was sufficient for removal. The foreman was responsible for ensuring that others obeyed rules concerning agency property and was supposed to safeguard the property within his control. The employee had 35 years of unblemished service. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 310, 313 (1983). Theft by a commissary employee of two cases of food warranted discharge in <span class="Italic">Norris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 15 MSPR 8, 10 (1983). Discharge was permissible after an employee stole a piece of meat. <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-674). Submission of forged prescriptions for medication by a nursing assistant warranted removal in <span class="Italic">Worsley v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-584). Discharge was sustained for removal of property valued at $15.54 by a store worker with 18 years of service. The individual worked in a position of trust with minimal supervision. The removal was warranted even though the agency table of penalties suggested a penalty ranging from a reprimand to a 10-day suspension for a first offense of minor theft. The portion of the penalty table permitting removal for a major incident of theft was applicable because the appellant's acts were deliberate, he worked under minimal supervision, he was in constant contact with government property easily stolen, and the penalty was consistently applied to others who were similarly charged as a result of their involvement in the same incident. <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 614, 616-17 (1982). Theft of cigarettes by a commissary worker warranted removal; the theft was ongoing and was apparently for other than personal use. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 23 MSPR 277, 279 (1984). Unauthorized possession of $35 to $70 worth of property was not <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> and supported removal of a manager of a supply center. <span class="Italic">Binns v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]fter careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the Board finds no error by the presiding official in affirming the penalty of removal under <span class="Italic">Douglas, supra.</span> Moreover, we have reconsidered the penalty in light of <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army,</span> 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984), in which the court held that removal of a Commissary worker was too harsh in relation to her theft of an item valued at only $2, her many years of service, the numerous commendations she received, and other factors. Appellant in the instant case also has a long record of prior, apparently satisfactory, service. Additionally, as the presiding official noted, he was experiencing emotional problems at the time of the theft. Balanced against those factors, however, are that Commissary workers received warnings against theft; appellant had signed such a warning only five days earlier; theft by commissary workers, who come into contact daily with millions of dollars worth of small items, is a particularly serious problem; such thefts obviously impact heavily on the employer-employee relationship because of the breach of trust they evidence; the instant theft was not only for personal gain but unlike in <span class="Italic">Miguel, supra,</span> also apparently was deliberate, premeditated, and furtive; and, again unlike in <span class="Italic">Miguel,</span> appellant was a foreman, in charge of Commissary salvage. Finally, of course, two charges are at issue in the instant case, the theft of almost $10 of consumer products as well as the trashing, without recordation, of useable items as unsaleable in order to prepare for an inspection.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2794"></span>Even when a supply production specialist's duties involved property disposal, leading to the Board's conclusion that the unauthorized possession of an item of government property by one who is responsible for the disposal and accounting of such property is a grave matter, a sustained charge of unauthorized possession of some agency property of minimal value as scrap slated for destruction warranted a 60-day suspension rather than removal. <span class="Italic">Culley v.

Removal for theft was sustained, however, when the value of the property taken was "not great," and when the appellant did not exercise control over the stolen item, but "the fact that he had access to the hoist by virtue of his position goes to the issue of trust." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harper v.
