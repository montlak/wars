<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-52"><span class="space">1.</span> Correction of Poor Performance</h4>
<p class="noindent">An interesting case arose concerning training designed to help poor performers in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA, Baltimore</span>, 25 FLRA 16, 18-19 (1987). The proposal was that the agency provide training for employees whose performance appraisal identified performance deficiencies. FLRA analyzed the case under the "excessive interference" standard and denied negotiability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first question is whether Proposal 1B is an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights. Pursuant to its management rights to assign work and direct employees, management evaluates employee performance against the performance standards established for each critical element.... Under Chapter 43 of title 5..., when an employee is determined to be performing at a less than satisfactory level, that employee is potentially subject to some remedial action, which may include demotion, reassignment, or removal. The proposal attempts to lessen the effect of that remedial action by requiring training in lieu of any other appropriate action. We find, therefore, that the proposal is intended as an "arrangement" to ameliorate the adverse effects of the exercise of management's right to evaluate employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue then becomes whether Proposal 1B excessively interferes with management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute. Because the proposal requires training and precludes reassignment or other disciplinary actions, it directly interferes with management rights.... As to whether that interference is so excessive as to render the proposal nonnegotiable, the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA No. 4, that the determination of what is an appropriate arrangement, in essence, involves weighing the benefits to employees of the proposed arrangement against the effect on management rights. In this case, while affected employees may benefit from the training required by the proposal, the need for that training is due to employee "fault," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, performance deficiency.... The employee interests at stake in the proposal are therefore not entitled to great weight and are not sufficient to justify depriving management of all discretion as to possible reassignment, demotion, or removal. The proposal is not limited to providing training for those employees who, in management's judgment, might profit from training. Rather, it would mandate training for employees found deficient without regard to the nature and extent of the deficiency. As a result, the proposal would require training where, in management's judgment, more serious action may be warranted. For example, the proposal would require training even where, under Chapter 43 of title 5, management would be authorized to remove an employee for unsatisfactory performance in a single critical element. By mandating training and foreclosing the exercise of other management rights, the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights to assign employees, to reduce employees in grade, or to remove employees. Section 7106(b)(3) does not justify completely removing management's ability to exercise other rights where they are warranted so as to benefit employees who have failed to perform acceptably.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 834-38 (1991), advanced the negotiability of training requirements. The proposal essentially called on management to evaluate employee performance in a career ladder program and, for groups of employees who did not perform as well as other groups, to determine whether there were training deficiencies. If there were training deficiencies, remedial training was to be provided by qualified supervisors. The plan was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we understand Proposal 19, it would require that, in those groups where examiners are failing in the Signatory Authority Program at a disproportionate rate, the reviewers in those groups would conduct sample reviews, which would be evaluated in order to determine the cause of the failures, so that certain corrective action could be taken.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This proposal is concerned with matters that vitally affect the working conditions of examiners in the Union's bargaining unit.... [T]he Agency does not dispute the Union's contention that the examiners' ability to succeed in the Program is substantially affected by: (1) technical abilities of the supervisors and reviewers in the examiners' assigned art areas and the manner in which they apply Program standards when evaluating examiners' work; (2) the training the Agency provides to its supervisors and reviewers; and (3) the training it provides examiners who participate in the Program. The proposal's requirements are directly concerned with these matters. Accordingly, the proposal does concern conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal does require the Agency to perform certain tasks, including maintaining records on failure rates in the Program. But...proposals do not interfere with management's rights simply because they would require the Agency to take some action it might otherwise not take....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal requires that the Agency assign reviewers in a group to conduct blind reviews, and that these reviews be evaluated by Agency officials outside of the group, with Union input. By so doing, the proposals directly interfere with the Agency's right to assign work.... While...Proposal 19 does not specify who shall conduct these regular reviews, the proposal appears to limit these blind reviews to those previously designated as reviewers. Further, by requiring that these blind reviews be evaluated by Agency officials from <span class="Italic">outside the group</span>, the proposal further limits the Agency in its exercise of its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the proposal requires corrective action, such as training of the reviewers and, therefore, directly interferes with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, however, that these parts of the proposal are intended to be "arrangements."... The Union has identified an adverse impact resulting from an exercise of the Agency's reserved management rights. Specifically, as a result of promotions and other assignments to supervisory positions, there can be a disparity in the relative experience in subject matter areas of supervisors and reviewers. As a result of this disparity, examiners in groups with less experienced and less knowledgeable supervisors can foreseeably be disadvantaged with regard to their preparation for successful completion of the Signatory Authority Program. This proposal seeks to ameliorate that problem by establishing a procedure to identify disadvantaged groups and require the Agency to take certain unspecified corrective action. For the reasons discussed below, we find the corrective actions called for in Proposal 19 to be negotiable appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The intended benefit of the blind reviews, which themselves will be evaluated, is to identify the cause or causes of a particular group's high failure rate. Once the cause is identified, appropriate action may be taken, resulting in more uniform opportunity for examiners to succeed in the Program. While this is a distinct benefit for the bargaining unit employees, it does not constitute an excessive interference with the exercise of the Agency's reserved rights. In that regard, the Agency retains the discretion to determine the number of blind reviews. While limiting the evaluators to Agency personnel outside the affected group, the proposal puts no other constraints on whom management may select for that task. With regard to Union input into the reviews, we find that any interference into management's rights would be minimal at most. The proposal requires only that the Union be permitted to express its views. The Agency retains the discretion to adopt or reject the Union's views....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the requirement that the Agency take corrective action where appropriate, the Agency retains the ultimate decision-making authority as to whether or what action is appropriate. Accordingly, the proposal does not excessively interfere with its right to assign training or other work it deems appropriate. Further, as we read the reporting requirements, the proposal merely requires that the Agency inform the Union as to what action, if any, was taken. It does not provide for further input or comment from the Union with regard to the appropriateness of that action. Accordingly, that part of the proposal also does not interfere with any right reserved to the Agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find the part of Proposal 19 that requires adequate training for examiners, where indicated, to be a negotiable appropriate arrangement. Correcting training deficiencies should serve to improve an examiner's performance in the Program, and therefore, such training would be an obvious benefit to the employee. On the other hand, the requirement does not place an onerous burden on the Agency. The proposal does not specify the type of training to be provided, such as formal classes or on-the-job training. Further, it does not dictate the training's scheduling or duration, nor does it specify who is to provide the training. These matters are left to the discretion of the Agency. The Authority has previously found proposals requiring "adequate training" to compensate for inadequacies caused by the exercise of management's rights to be negotiable appropriate arrangements where the determinations as to the substance and form of training are left to management's discretion.... Similarly, we find here that the training requirement does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to assign work and is, therefore, a negotiable appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the provision of Proposal 19 that requires the Agency to assign supervisors who are "experienced and competent" constitutes an appropriate arrangement. This provision is similar to those in Proposal 17 that required that case reviewers would be competent and familiar with the subject matter being reviewed, whenever possible. The value to an examiner's career development of being supervised and trained by competent and experienced individuals is both obvious and significant. On the other hand, as we noted in connection with Proposal 17, general, nonquantitative standards such as "competent and experienced" leave a great deal of discretion to management with respect to its determinations regarding the qualifications of supervisors. Significantly, the proposal does not attempt to define competence nor does it require the assignment of any specific individuals to supervisory <span id="page_655"></span>tasks. Accordingly, we find this part of Proposal 19 also to be a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, Bureau of Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement and AFGE Nat'l INS Council Local 2859</span>, 60 FLRA 131, 134-35 (2004), determined that an arbitrator's award requiring the agency to provide limited remedial firearms training to an employee did not excessively infringe management's rights to assign work or to determine internal security practices:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also cites to <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 108-09 (2000) (Member Wasserman dissenting as to Proposal 35) for the proposition that a proposal requiring a minimum of 12 hours of formal classroom training to every employee excessively interfered with management's right to assign work because it deprived management of discretion with respect to the duration and type of training. However, upon review of that determination, we note that the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A requirement that the Agency provide examiners with a minimum 12 hours of classroom training does not appear excessive, particularly when measured against the potential adverse effects on examiners from inefficient use of the automated system. However, the blanket nature of the proposal would deprive the Agency of any discretion to deviate from a specified minimum number of hours. Moreover, Proposal 35 would constrain the Agency not only with regard to the duration of the training, but also with regard to the type of the training [requiring "classroom" training]. In these circumstances, we conclude that Proposal 35's effect on management's right to assign work would be disproportionate to the benefits that employees would derive from it. Accordingly, Proposal 35 is not within the Agency's duty to bargain because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 56 FLRA at 109.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, after review of the above, we note that a contract provision which sets forth a specific duration of training does not in itself excessively interfere with an agency's right to assign work as argued by the Agency. Moreover, in the circumstances of that case, the training was a "one size fits all" approach requiring a set amount of training for every employee regardless of proficiency and it dictated that the training must take place in a "formal classroom." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 108, 109. In contrast, the parties' agreement, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, involves only a single employee and leaves to the discretion of the Agency where the training can take place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the benefits afforded the employee, it is clear that if an employee fails to satisfactorily complete firearms training, that employee would be reassigned to "non-sensitive, non-inspectional" duties. Under this award, the employee has the opportunity to meet the Agency requirements for carrying a firearm and, therefore, not be precluded from assuming the full duties of an immigration inspector. We find that this benefit to the employee is significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the above, we find that the Arbitrator's interpretation and application of the parties' agreement does not excessively interfere with the Agency's management rights as the benefits to the employee outweigh the burden to the Agency. As such, the Arbitrator's award does not violate prong I under<span class="Italic"> BEP</span>.</p>
