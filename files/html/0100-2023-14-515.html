<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-516"><span class="space">3.</span> Assignment of Desks, Workstations; Seniority</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal concerning assignment of desks at a new location was negotiable. It did not infringe the right to determine technology of performing work. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Midwest Reg'l Office, Chicago and NTEU Chap. 95</span>, 16 FLRA 141, 144 (1984) (ALJ Decision). A proposal permitting employees to have new seating assignments in a new work area based on choice and seniority was nonnegotiable. The agency asserted that its seating allocation arrangement was designed to facilitate supervision of the employees by the function of their work. FLRA concluded that the agency plan of seating was a method and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 19 FLRA 1180, 1181 (1985) (Proposal 1). Nothing barred the negotiation of a proposal concerning placement of various employees' desks and associated materials when management did not establish that or other defenses. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 36 FLRA 655, 672 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Providing a summary of the considerations governing proposals seeking to permit employees flexibility in assignment of their placement in an office, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Ft. Lauderdale</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1286-91 (1991), explained of a proposal that revenue officers be allowed to choose their own seating in the area designated for field collection employees, seniority to govern competing selections:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the proposal does not directly interfere with management's rights to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute or the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right of an agency under section 7106(a)(1) to determine its organization refers to the administrative and functional structure of an agency, including the relationships of personnel through lines of authority and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and <span id="page_998"></span>assigned duties.... This right encompasses the determination of how an agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority decisions concerning the relationship between an agency's right to determine its organization and the designation of official duty stations are closely tied to the specific circumstances involved in each case.... The Authority previously has found that the terms "official station," "duty station," and "post of duty" usually refer to something more general than a work area or floor within a building.... Authority precedent does not support the broad conclusion that whenever an agency chooses to call the specific location in which employees are assigned to perform their work an "official duty station," the choice of that location always constitutes an exercise of the right to determine organization under the Statute.... Rather, Authority precedent supports a conclusion that an agency's designation of "official station," "duty station," or "post of duty" is encompassed within the right to determine organization only insofar as that designation has a direct and substantive relationship to an agency's administrative and functional structure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in order for its designation of "duty station" to come within the scope of the right to determine the organization of an agency, the Agency must establish that the "duty station" of employees, that is, where they are physically located, has a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's administrative or functional structure. For the following reasons, we find that the Agency has not established that its determination to allow employees to select where they sit within the floor space designated for the three groups of revenue officers meets this requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency states that the proposal would have a "'direct and substantive relationship to [the] agency's administrative and functional structure...[f]or the reasons set forth...with regard to 'methods and means[.]'" [sic] The Agency's argument must be rejected for two reasons. First, the arguments presented in support of the Agency's methods and means contention do not establish that the choice of seating assignment constitutes an exercise of the Agency's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. Second, nothing contained in the proposal or the Union's explanation would affect the Agency's decision to segment employees by group. In this regard, the Union clearly states that employee choice of seating would be "limited...by Agency, functional lines."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has not established that its determination to allow employees to select where they sit from within the floor space designated for the three groups of revenue officers has a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's administrative and functional structure. Therefore, we find that the proposal does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its organization....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. First, an agency must show a direct and integral relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission.

The term "performing work" is intended to include those matters that directly and integrally relate to the agency's operations as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relative importance of a particular "means" of performing work is irrelevant to a determination of whether a proposal interferes with the right to determine the methods and means of performing work. The means employed need not be indispensable to the accomplishment of an agency's mission. Rather, the means need only be "a matter that is 'used <span id="page_999"></span>to attain or make more likely the attainment of a desired end' or 'used by the agency for the accomplishing or furthering of the performance of its work.'"... Establishing a "functional grouping" of employees constitutes the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) where it is shown that the performance of an agency's work is facilitated by the ability to group employees based on the functions which they perform.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency here fails to establish that there is a direct and integral relationship between its plan of seating revenue officers within each group and accomplishing the Agency's mission. Initially, we stress that nothing in the proposal would prevent the Agency from assigning employees to groups. The proposal is concerned only with seating assignments, by allowing employees to choose where they sit on the floor space allocated for the three groups of revenue officers, rather than requiring employees to be seated by group. In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 36 FLRA 655 (1990), the Authority found that a change in employees' seating assignments gave rise to a bargaining obligation. In reaching that result, we noted that the location at which employees perform their duties, as one aspect of an employee's office environment, concerns a matter "at the very heart of the traditional meaning of 'conditions of employment.'"... The Authority also has found negotiable proposals relating basically to seating assignments in other contexts. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">HHS, Claremore</span>, 39 FLRA at 512-14 (proposal to provide a private office for a certain employee was found to be negotiable because agency did not show that there was a direct relationship between having the employee located with the rest of the employees in the department and the accomplishment of the agency's work); <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Family Support Admin.</span>, 28 FLRA 1108 (1987) (proposal allowing for office selection by seniority negotiable as proposal would be implemented within program arrangement selected by agency).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find unpersuasive the Agency's assertions that seating employees within each group would allow for better communication, development of an informal mentor system, and permit supervisors to better monitor their employees. Office floor plans submitted by the Agency, as attachments to its statement of position, indicate that employees' desks are clustered in groups of four, and that there are seven such clusters. All of the clusters appear to be located within a very short distance of one another and in close proximity to each of the three group supervisors. Given this arrangement, a supervisor, at most, would have to walk a slightly greater distance in order to meet with an employee than if the employee were located closer to the supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, Claremore</span> (Authority found that grouping employees together for convenience of supervisor and its effect on supervisory control did not constitute a functional grouping of employees so as to constitute a method or means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1)). Similarly, employees seeking advice or assistance, at most, would have to walk the additional few steps to another employee's desk. Moreover, there are partitions surrounding employees' desks or other obstacles that serve to prevent or impair direct observation by supervisors of their employees. In this regard, the Union notes, without contradiction, that the conference room located near the office of one of the supervisors blocks the view of one of the clusters. Additionally, as employees are out of the office for significant periods of time, the need for seating on an intragroup basis in order to maintain supervisory control and communication is somewhat diminished.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to the Agency's argument concerning the need to segregate, or move closer to the appropriate supervisor, disruptive or poorly performing employees, the record does not establish that such problems existed prior to the relocation when employees were not located by group or that such problems would not exist, at least in part, if employees were seated on an intragroup basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Treasury, IRS</span> and <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span> to be misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Treasury, IRS</span>, the Authority found that a union proposal to provide 64 square feet of space for each bargaining unit employee did not prevent the agency from establishing a functional grouping of employees. Initially, however, the Authority found that the agency's plan to establish the functional grouping of employees constituted a means of performing work because the agency had established that the functional grouping facilitated supervision, communication, instructional capability, coverage for absent employees and created a team atmosphere. By contrast, as discussed above, the proposal here would not have a significant effect on those factors. In this regard, we note particularly the discussion above that supervision, communication and the ability of employees to seek assistance or advice from other employees would not be significantly impaired by the proposal. In <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, the Authority found that the agency had established that a proposal concerning preference of seating assignments was directly and integrally related to the agency's operations. No such showing has been made here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the proposal would interfere with the methods and means of performing work, as alleged. As the proposal also would not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its organization, we find that the proposal is within the duty to bargain.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. First, an agency must show a direct and integral relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission. Second, the agency must show that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 83 and Dept. of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 406 (1990).</p>
