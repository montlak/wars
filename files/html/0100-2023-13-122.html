<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-121"><span class="space">c.</span> Alternatives to Suspension</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The choice of an indefinite suspension, rather than an alternative (detail, reassignment, assignment to unclassified duties, demotion to a job not requiring a clearance, or administrative leave) is for the agency to make. The Board's authority to review that choice is opaquely stated in its decisions and circumscribed by Federal Circuit decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The starting point in the analysis is <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 19, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), the first Board decision comprehensively defining indefinite suspensions, albeit in as to investigation in matters criminal. It will be recalled that <span class="Italic">Martin</span> stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another element of the agency's proof is the reasonableness of its penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981). Thus, agencies must show that a lesser penalty would be ineffective under the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the Supreme Court decided <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 522 (1988), involving a termination for loss of a clearance and a determination by the Court that the Board lacked the authority to consider the validity of the underlying clearance revocation when it considered the adverse action appeal. The Court did not consider what the Board might be required to consider as to alternatives to removal, but the Court noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without a security clearance, respondent was not eligible for the job for which he had been hired. Reassignment to a nonsensitive position at the facility was not possible because there was no nonsensitive position there....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Board declared that unless there is some authority to the contrary, reassignment to a position requiring less than a full range of duties is not required for an indefinite suspension based upon suspension of a security clearance pending inquiry into the ability of the appellant to hold a clearance. <span class="Italic">Torrance v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 254, 258-59 (1991).<span class="Italic"> Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 425, 429-31 (1991), considered whether an appellant whose security clearance is suspended may, instead of being indefinitely suspended, require that the agency place him in a nonsensitive position if others under analogous circumstances have been reassigned. The Board would not disturb the agency's discretion without an agency regulation requiring the reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that, while the possession of a green badge does not allow an employee access to classified material, it allows the employee physical access to the CIA, which, under the agency's regulations, "is a level 1 restricted area in which access is controlled because the area contains a security interest which if lost, stolen, compromised, or sabotaged would cause damage to the command mission or national security."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Alston v. Department of the Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 694, 698-699 (1991), the Board found that it has no authority to review the agency's reasons for suspending an employee's access to classified documents and secured areas. Rather, the Board held that its authority under <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 509, 519 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 868 F.2d 1277 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table), is limited to determining whether the agency afforded the employee minimum due process rights. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred here by adjudicating the merits of the agency's decision to deny the appellant a green badge and by finding that the agency engaged in disparate treatment in not issuing him a green badge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, at 698-699; <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, [<span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 680 (1991)] at 685 n.14 (the Board lacks the authority to review a claim of disparate treatment in connection with the suspension of an employee's security access).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency has established by preponderant evidence that: (1) The appellant's position of Pipefitter requires a security clearance; (2) the agency suspended his security access; and (3) the agency effected his indefinite suspension because it had suspended his security access.... Furthermore, the agency identified the condition subsequent that will lead to the termination of the appellant's indefinite suspension, i.e., a final decision regarding his security clearance by the agency's CAF....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the appellant is not entitled to reassignment to another position. The agency's Acting Director of the Office of Civilian Personnel Management, Terry J. Haycock, submitted below a statement, under penalty of perjury, declaring that the agency has no regulation or policy that requires reassignment of employees following loss of a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered this affidavit but found that it was outweighed by other evidence. He noted that local agency instructions, NAVSEAINST 5510.2B, provide for the issuance of access control badges, including green badges, to employees with suspended security clearances in order to allow them access to the CIA when the Shipyard Commander <span id="Page_2166"></span>determines that issuance of such badges is in the Shipyard's best interest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge also noted that the Director of the Security Office indicated in his testimony that the Shipyard conducted routine reviews for green badges for employees whose security clearance have been suspended. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge therefore found that the Shipyard had a policy of allowing employees with a suspended clearance to remain in a duty status pending a final determination on their security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in this regard. The mere fact that the Shipyard generally issues green badges to employees with a suspended security clearance does not entitle the appellant to a green badge, and thus, to reassignment. Absent a "showing of an existing agency policy to reassign employees to alternative positions where feasible as manifested by regulation," the Board will end its inquiry once it determines that an employee has failed to maintain a security clearance and that he has received the procedural protections provided by 5 USC 7513. <span class="Italic">VanDuzer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 357, 361-62 (1989). Here, the appellant does not contend that the agency's regulations grant him the right to be considered for reassignment. In fact, the agency has presented evidence to the contrary, as indicated in Mr. Haycock's affidavit. Therefore, we find that the appellant has no right to a green badge that would permit him to be reassigned to another position....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> cited <span class="Italic">Egan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 509, 522-23 (1985), leading to the 1988 Supreme Court decision. The 1985 Board decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> concerned a clearance revocation and an inability to reassign Mr. Egan because, according to the undisputed assertion in the adverse action proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice further stated that reassignment was not possible because there were no other positions in the facility which did not require access to classified materials and that, based on the nature of the facility's mission, "it would not be possible to restructure or sanitize the job environment to eliminate the requirement for a security clearance."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an employee who served in a position involving nuclear material shipments and whose position required certification under the agency's Human Reliability Program, the Board determined that, based on <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the AJ should have considered whether a lesser penalty than indefinite suspension would have sufficed, including reassignment based on an agency regulation, <span class="Italic">Sanchez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish that an indefinite suspension is reasonable, the agency must show that a lesser penalty, such as reassignment, would be ineffective under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Vega v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant identified at least one position for which he was allegedly qualified and that did not require HRP certification. The appellant also identified other positions that, according to the agency's discovery response, were available in the New Mexico area in 2008, 2009, and 2010, and that had a status and compensation level equal to or below the level of the position from which the agency removed him, although it is not clear from the record whether any of these positions required HRP certification. Further, at the end of the hearing, the administrative judge read into the record the agency's response to the appellant's request for admissions in a related EEO case in which the agency conceded that it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[H]ad or continues to have positions similarly situated to [the appellant's] position available within the greater Albuquerque area between the time [the appellant] was removed from his former position until the date of this discovery request that did not or does not require the person to have an HRP certification or qualification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency made a similar admission in the instant matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record indicates that positions may have been available that did not require HRP certification and for which the appellant may have been qualified, we REMAND the appeal for evidence and argument on whether reassignment, rather than indefinite suspension, would have been effective under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There followed decisions in 2014 involving complex analyses of constitutional due process and little if any mention of <span class="Italic">Martin</span> as a source of alternatives to indefinite suspensions when clearances are suspended. The 2014 analysis began with <span class="Italic">Buelna v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BUELNA_ALEXANDER_DA_0752_09_0404_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1047534.pdf">121 MSPR 262</a>, 276-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-28, 2014 MSPB 45 (2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner, concurring), decided on June 19, 2014:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">If there are viable alternatives to indefinite suspension, due process requires that the employee be afforded an opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the penalty, the appellant has argued that he was denied a meaningful opportunity to persuade the deciding official to take an action other than the proposed indefinite suspension. In <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, our reviewing court declined to address what due process would be required had the petitioner in that case claimed entitlement to a penalty other than suspension without pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 727 F.3d at 1185 n.4. Because the appellant in this case has asserted that the agency denied him due process concerning the penalty imposed, that question is now before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Court recognized in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the right to invoke the deciding official's discretion exists only "in such cases" where there is doubt as to the appropriateness or necessity of the penalty. 470 U.S. at 543. For example, there is no due process right "to insist on a hearing in order to argue that the decisionmaker should be lenient and depart from legal requirements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543 n.8 (citing <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Love</span>, 431 U.S. 105, 114 (1977)); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Delong v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 264 F.3d 1334, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (where the petitioner's criminal record required her removal pursuant to 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3207, due process did not require that she be afforded a hearing on the issue of her fitness for service in a covered position). Due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent there may have existed viable alternatives to suspension without pay, e.g., placement on administrative leave, the appellant had a due process right to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 543. Here, the deciding official declared under penalty of perjury that he had authority under the agency's discipline procedures to choose alternatives to the proposed indefinite suspension, including the appellant's requested outcome of continued placement on administrative leave. The appellant has not rebutted that evidence, and we conclude that he was afforded an opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to change the outcome of the proposed action to the extent that may have been feasible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nonprecedential decision issued before the 2014 <span class="Italic">Buelna</span> decision obliquely suggested the necessity for agency discretion in the choice of penalties in indefinite suspension cases based on clearance suspensions. <span class="Italic">Ludwigs v. DHS,</span> DA-0752-12-0089-I-1 (NP 3/21/2013), reversed an indefinite suspension when the appellant had no meaningful opportunity to respond to a clearance suspension and when the agency failed to demonstrate whether it had discretion to reassign the appellant or place him on administrative leave rather than indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not have the opportunity to respond to any official with authority to restore his security clearance. Ballinger testified that he had no involvement in the decision to suspend the appellant's security clearance, and no authority to reverse that underlying determination. Nor did the appellant have an opportunity to contest the security clearance suspension before any other agency official. Although the PSD informed the appellant that he could contact a Personnel Security Specialist if he had questions regarding the suspension of his security clearance, it did not provide him with an opportunity to appeal its decision. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the record does not indicate that Ballinger had discretion to reassign the appellant or place him on administrative leave in lieu of the proposed indefinite suspension. Ballinger testified that he had "no flexibility" to provide the appellant with alternative work and that he was not aware of any case where a Federal Air Marshal was placed on administrative leave or given work while his security clearance was suspended. When the appellant's representative asked whether Ballinger agreed that "there's nothing much [the appellant] could have possibly said that would have made a difference," Ballinger answered that he did not know. Ballinger elaborated by noting that the appellant did not respond to the proposal notice; however, he failed to explain how any response by the appellant could have led to another result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the circumstances as a whole, we conclude that the agency denied the appellant due process by failing to provide him a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the proposed indefinite suspension. We note that the appellant made no response to the proposal notice; however, the agency's due process obligations were in no way diminished by his decision not to participate in what would have been an empty formality. The appellant is therefore automatically entitled to an "entirely new" and "constitutionally correct" adverse action proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Bulena</span> was <span class="Italic">Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542-43 (1985), predating the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and concerning the pretermination process for a state civil servant whose termination for submitting a dishonest employment application was challenged for lack of due process. The Court stated that "We have described 'the root requirement' of the Due Process Clause as being 'that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest,'" and that "Even where the facts are clear, the appropriateness or necessity of the <span id="Page_2167"></span>discharge may not be; in such cases, the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appeal of an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 based on the denial, revocation, or suspension of a security clearance, the Board does not have the authority to review the substance of the underlying security clearance determination. <span class="Italic">Gamboa v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 5 (2014) (citing <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988)). Rather, the Board only has the authority to review whether: (1) the appellant's position required a clearance; (2) the clearance was denied, revoked, or suspended; and (3) the employee was provided with the procedural protections specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Ulep v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 4 (2014) (citing <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). Section 7513, however, is not the only source of procedural protections for employees subject to adverse actions; agencies must also comply with the procedures set forth in their own regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An employee also has a due process right to notice of the grounds in support of the adverse action--here, notice that her position required a security clearance and that she could no longer remain in that position once her clearance was suspended--and a meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with the authority to select an alternative outcome, to the extent an alternative penalty may have been feasible. <span class="Italic">See Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-28 (2014); <span class="Italic">see also Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no dispute that the appellant's position required a security clearance or that her clearance was suspended based upon her indictment on federal criminal charges. The agency, moreover, complied with the procedural protections of section 7513 by providing the appellant at least 30 days' advanced notice of its proposed action, a period of time of more than 7 days to reply, the right to be represented, and a written decision on the proposed action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1)-(4). The appellant has not argued that the agency violated one of its specific policies or regulations in effecting her indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ulep</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (finding that the agency violated its own process regarding "unfavorable administrative actions" relating to personnel security). Additionally, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency did not violate the appellant's right to due process in effecting her suspension because she had the opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official who, within the parameters of the agency's disciplinary procedures, had the authority to consider and impose alternative forms of discipline in lieu of the proposed indefinite suspension.[1] <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;To the extent the administrative judge relied upon the Board's decisions which are modified by <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 18 n.7, the administrative judge's initial decision is similarly modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In an adverse action arising out of a security clearance determination, an agency need only consider whether an employee's reassignment to a nonsensitive position is feasible when statutes, regulations, or policies require it to do so.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency does not have a policy requiring it to consider reassigning an employee to a nonsensitive position or placing an employee on paid administrative leave following the suspension of her security clearance.[2] As discussed below, we also agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency did not otherwise err by not reassigning the appellant to a nonsensitive position. <span class="Italic">See Schnedar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 7 n.1 (2014) (the Board may review whether an employee's transfer to a nonsensitive position is feasible only where a statute or regulation provides the employee a substantive right to such a reassignment) (citing <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant suggests on review that the agency's "own personnel policies call for consideration of demotion as an alternative to a more serious sanction." The section of the agency's disciplinary policy cited by the appellant, however, addresses demotions in general, not in the specific context of a revocation or suspension of access to classified information, and we find nothing in this policy to suggest that the agency has an internal policy granting employees a substantive right to reassignment following the revocation or suspension of their access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that, under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, the agency should have considered alternative forms of discipline prior to imposing her indefinite suspension and that its failure to do so entitles the agency's penalty selection to less deference. Although acknowledging the Federal Circuit's longstanding approach that an agency need only consider transferring an employee to a nonsensitive position where a statute, regulation, or agency policy provides the employee with a substantive right to reassignment, <span class="Italic">see Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 158-81, the appellant argues that, under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, an agency is also required to assess the reasonableness of its penalty selection by demonstrating that it considered whether lesser forms of discipline were feasible before imposing an indefinite suspension ("the Board requires due process to be applied and appropriate penalty considerations by agencies under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> despite recognition that an indefinite suspension is not an ordinary disciplinary action..."). For the reasons below, we decline the appellant's invitation to reanimate under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> what our reviewing court has expressly foreclosed in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, and <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Department of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1989), which were decided on the same day, the Federal Circuit held that, in the absence of a statute, regulation, or policy mandating the transfer or reassignment of an employee who is denied a security clearance, "the Board has no role" in reviewing whether an employee should have been reassigned instead of receiving an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1581; <span class="Italic">see Lyles</span>, 864 F.2d at 1583-84. Despite the appellant's arguments to the contrary, consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors would be inappropriate in this case, because in the absence of a statute or regulation requiring the agency to seek out alternative employment, we lack authority to review whether the lesser sanction of reassignment to a nonsensitive position would have been feasible.[3] <span class="Italic">See Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant argues on review that <span class="Italic">Holley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 300 (1994), requires a deciding official to determine whether it is "feasible to maintain the appellant in a duty status," and that the deciding official in this case erred when she "made no such determination." The Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Holley</span>, however, makes clear that the Board does not have the authority to review the feasibility of reassignment to a nonsensitive position and that there was no claim that the agency had a regulation requiring it to consider reassignment prior to suspending the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Holley</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 304-05. To the extent the footnote in <span class="Italic">Holley</span> suggests otherwise, we find that it is dicta and it does not require an agency to affirmatively demonstrate that reassignment is not feasible before imposing an indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites earlier Board decisions which opined that an agency had to demonstrate that reassigning an employee to a nonsensitive position was not possible before it would affirm an employee's indefinite suspension based upon the loss or revocation of a security clearance. (citing <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 12, 21 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. Brown v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 366, 369 n.2 (1988) (the Board has held that the agency bears the burden, as part of its case in chief, to show that it could not reassign the appellant to a nonsensitive position within the facility where he was employed) (citing <span class="Italic">Van Duzer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 202, 206 (1988)). The Board decisions cited by the appellant, however, predate <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> and <span class="Italic">Lyles</span> and they cannot be harmonized with this later line of cases.[5] <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> and <span class="Italic">Lyles</span>, moreover, are controlling authority which we are bound to follow unless modified by our reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See Conner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 670, &#x00B6; 6 (2014) (precedential decisions of the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board which the Board is bound to follow unless otherwise overruled by the court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>). We therefore find the appellant's arguments unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board modified <span class="Italic">Martin</span> on other grounds not relevant to this appeal in <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 663 n.5 (1994). In any case, at issue in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> were indefinite suspensions where the agency had reasonable cause to believe that the appellants had committed crimes for which imprisonment could be imposed. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 13. We do not find such suspensions to be comparable to those arising out of security clearance determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Accordingly, to the extent <span class="Italic">Woroneski</span> and <span class="Italic">Van Duzer</span> hold that an agency must demonstrate that it considered reassigning an employee to a nonsensitive position before removing or indefinitely suspending the employee based upon the denial or suspension of a security clearance, these decisions are OVERRULED. <span class="Italic">See Biggers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 745 F.3d 1360, 1362 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2168"></span>We further reject the appellant's suggestion that she has a due process right to be considered for reassignment to a nonsensitive position. Although the Board has found that an employee has a constitutional due process right to respond to a notice of proposed adverse action based upon the suspension of her security clearance, <span class="Italic">see Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, the Board has recently clarified that this right is limited to invoking the discretion of a deciding official who has the authority to select from among alternative penalties, to the extent such alternatives are permitted, feasible, and within management's purview, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-28. Thus, we find misplaced the appellant's arguments that the agency committed a due process violation by not adequately justifying why it did not consider reassigning her to a posted vacancy or why it did not continue to keep her on paid administrative leave. Under <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> and <span class="Italic">Lyles</span>, moreover, if an appellant does not have a right to be considered for a reassignment following the suspension of her security clearance unless granted by agency policy, statute, or regulation, then an appellant does not have a greater due process right to be considered for such a reassignment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gargiulo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 727 F.3d 1181, 1186 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (explaining that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), an employee has a "statutory, not constitutional" right to respond to a proposed adverse action based upon a suspension of his access to classified information, and that "employees do not have constitutional due process rights in connection with security clearance determinations"); <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 25 (the right to notice of the specific reasons underlying a security clearance suspension is not constitutional, but rather is statutory, or in some cases a matter of agency policy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge correctly declined to order the appellant's reinstatement to employment or placement on paid administrative leave following her acquittal on criminal charges.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge should have ordered her reinstatement to employment or placement on paid administrative leave following her acquittal on the criminal charges which served as the basis for the suspension of her security clearance. The Board's decisions recognize that, to be valid, an indefinite suspension must have an ascertainable end; that is, a determinable condition subsequent that will bring the suspension to a conclusion. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 350, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). The Board, however, will not impose a condition subsequent different from the one identified by the agency in its decision imposing the indefinite suspension. The Board's role in an appeal alleging an impermissible continuation of an indefinite suspension is limited to reviewing whether the condition subsequent identified by the agency has occurred and whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to terminate the suspension following the satisfaction of the condition subsequent. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant based upon the suspension of her security clearance. The condition subsequent triggering the cessation of the appellant's suspension, therefore, is the restoration of her security clearance. The agency, however, has not restored the appellant's security clearance, and, in the absence of the restoration of her security clearance, the Board is without the authority to order that the appellant be returned to duty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smallwood v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 221, 225 (1994) (an agency was not required to give an employee a deadline for when it would make a decision on his security clearance, which was the condition subsequent stated in his indefinite suspension); <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993) (the lack of a security clearance constitutes a compelling reason not to return the appellant to his prior position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant asks the Board to order her placement on paid administrative leave as a way to counterbalance the agency's unfettered discretion to review and control her access to classified information, we find that ordering the appellant's reinstatement to paid administrative leave while her security clearance remains suspended would be tantamount to undoing the agency's indefinite suspension action, <span class="Italic">see Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 28 (finding that the deciding official's authority to choose to continue the appellant's administrative leave status was sufficient to satisfy due process). The Board, moreover, is precluded from ordering the appellant's reinstatement to a position requiring access to classified information when she is without the required clearance to access such information. <span class="Italic">See Skees v.

Appx. 191 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Additionally, we find that ordering the appellant's restoration to duty or to a paid administrative leave status before the agency reinstates her access to classified information would intrude upon the agency's authority to regulate and manage employees' access to classified information. <span class="Italic">See Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148, 1155 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Hard on the heels of <span class="Italic">Ryan</span> followed <span class="Italic">Munoz v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MUNOZ_JORGE_R_DA_0752_13_0445_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1073319.pdf">121 MSPR 483</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16, 2014 MSPB 66 (2014), decided on August 20, 2014, and determining that the Board would not consider a defense of disparate treatment or penalties in its analysis of an indefinite suspension based on a clearance suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the penalty, the appellant contends that the agency treated him less favorably than comparator employees. In particular, the appellant contends that he had overheard a conversation that suggested that another employee whose security clearance was revoked was reassigned to another position. An appellant's allegation that the agency treated him disparately as compared to another employee, without a claim of prohibited discrimination, is an allegation of disparate penalties to be proven by the appellant and considered by the Board in determining the reasonableness of the penalty, but it is not an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 20 (2010). The consistency of an agency-imposed penalty with those imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses is one factor the Board will consider under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06, in determining whether the penalty is reasonable, <span class="Italic">Woebcke</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The traditional <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis, however, does not apply in this instance. The agency's indefinite suspension action was not a sanction or penalty for misconduct; rather, it was based on the revocation of the appellant's security clearance required for his position. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 18 (2014) (finding that the analysis for mitigating the penalty under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> does not apply where the agency's action is based on physical inability to perform, consistent with the Board's practice of not applying them to nondisciplinary matters). Moreover, the Board has declined to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in cases involving adverse actions based on security clearance or eligibility determinations where an employee has not been provided a substantive right to reassignment through statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Ryan v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2014 MSPB 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 9 (indefinite suspension based on suspension of a security clearance); <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-2, 12 (removal based on ineligibility to occupy a sensitive position). The Board has found that consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors would be inappropriate in such cases because, in the absence of a statute or regulation requiring the agency to seek out alternative employment, the Board lacks the authority to review whether an employee's reassignment to a position not requiring a security clearance would have been feasible. <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>, 2014 MSPB 64, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580-81 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (finding that, in the absence of a statute, regulation, or policy mandating the transfer or reassignment of an employee who is denied a security clearance, "the Board has no role" in reviewing whether an employee should have been reassigned instead of receiving an adverse action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no statute or regulation requiring the agency to seek out alternative employment for the appellant in this case. We therefore lack the authority to consider whether the agency could have reassigned the appellant to a position not requiring a security clearance, even if it had previously reassigned similarly-situated employees to such positions. Thus, to the extent the appellant contends that at least one other comparator employee had been reassigned following the revocation of that employee's security clearance, we decline to consider this claim under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See Ryan</span>, 2014 MSPB 64, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12. Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency's chosen penalty does not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Putnam v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PUTNAM_KRISTI_L_DE_0752_12_0039_I_3_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1076101.pdf">121 MSPR 532</a>, 539-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 2014 MSPB 70 (2014), decided on August 27, 2014, determined that there was no due process violation resulting from the deciding official's limited flexibility in a penalty choice in an indefinite suspension based on suspension of a clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the Board's pre-<span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> decisions in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, and <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, the appellant argues on petition for review that her due process rights were violated because the deciding official did not have the authority to impose a penalty other than her proposed indefinite suspension. Under our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, however, due <span id="Page_2169"></span>process in the context of an adverse action based upon the suspension or revocation of a security clearance does not require that the deciding official have the unfettered discretion to take any action he or she believes is appropriate upon considering the proposed adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 27 (due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview). Thus, the appellant's assertion of a due process violation based on the deciding official's purported limited authority to select a penalty other than the appellant's proposed suspension is no longer germane to the issues in this case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant's assertion that the deciding official had limited authority to impose an alternative penalty is unsupported. Although the appellant argues that the deciding official had no authority to reassign her, the deciding official testified that he had the authority to consider reassigning the appellant to another position but that he exercised his discretion and elected not to reassign her under the facts of this case. Although the appellant ascribes error to the deciding official's decision, when a security clearance has been suspended or revoked, "the Board does not have the authority to review the feasibility of [ ] reassignment in the absence of an additional agency regulation or policy statement providing for such a transfer." <span class="Italic">Biggers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 745 F.3d 1360, 1362 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2014); <span class="Italic">see Schnedar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 7 n.1 (2014). Here, there is no evidence that the agency has a policy of compulsory reassignment before imposing an indefinite suspension. Thus, under our due process standard articulated in <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, we find that the appellant had the opportunity to invoke the discretion of the deciding official, thereby satisfying the minimum requirements of due process as to her indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 28.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Biggers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 745 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2014), cited in <span class="Italic">Putnam</span>, involved a claim for back pay when an indefinitely suspended employee had his clearance restored. <span class="Italic">Putnam</span> referenced a footnote from the <span class="Italic">Biggers</span> decision. Footnote one in <span class="Italic">Biggers</span> stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, we held that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not create a substantive right to transfer an employee to a non-sensitive position, and therefore, the Board does not have authority to review the feasibility of such reassignment in the absence of an additional agency regulation or policy statement providing for such transfer. 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Here, there was a Navy policy stating "that reassignment following loss of clearance...[was] neither mandatory nor desirable."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Griffin v. DMA</span>, 864 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1989), noted in <span class="Italic">Biggers</span>, involved a clearance-based removal, not an indefinite suspension. But cited in <span class="Italic">Putnam</span> was <span class="Italic">Schnedar v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SCHNEDAR_JAMES_DE_0752_11_0343_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_960844.pdf">120 MSPR 516</a>, 519 n.1, 2014 MSPB 5 (2014), a clearance-based indefinite suspension case. The footnote reference in <span class="Italic">Schnedar</span> relied on <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> to preclude in indefinite suspension cases analysis of alternatives to the suspension unless a statute or agency regulation otherwise required:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[1] In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court stated that the Board may also review whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530-31. However, as the Federal Circuit clarified in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989), that inquiry is pertinent only where a statute or regulation provides the employee a substantive right to such reassignment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonprecedential decisions issued after <span class="Italic">Ryan</span> recognized the obligation of agency officials to exercise a choice among alternatives to indefinite suspensions but disavowed the authority of the Board to review the choice made. <span class="Italic">Perez v. DHS</span>, NY-0752-11-0254-I-2 (NP 9/11/2014), reversed a clearance-based indefinite suspension when the deciding official did not believe he had discretion to choose an alternative course of action, e.g., continuation of administrative leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent there may have existed other alternatives to suspension without pay, the appellant had a due process right to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives. In this regard, we note that TSA policy does not explicitly require that an indefinite suspension be imposed in every case where an employee's required security clearance has been suspended. Rather, it provides only that an indefinite suspension "may be imposed" in such cases. We therefore conclude that management was not precluded from choosing an alternative course of action, such as leaving the appellant on administrative leave pending the outcome of her response to the CSO. The question therefore arises whether the appellant had a meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such an alternative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant did not receive such an opportunity because at the time Mr. Saez issued the decision, he did not regard himself as having authority to do anything other than impose the proposed indefinite suspension. In his decision letter, Mr. Saez quoted the TSA policy described above, but incorrectly paraphrased it as a blanket requirement that "FAMs are placed on indefinite suspension when they do not have access to classified information because they are unable to perform their duties without such access." In addition, Mr. Saez stated that his review authority was strictly limited to review of the appellant's actual access to classified information and its relation to her ability to perform FAM duties, and that the "sole purpose" of his meeting with the appellant "was to address the suspension of [the appellant's] security clearance" and render a decision. Thus, it appears that Mr. Saez erroneously believed that TSA policy required the appellant's indefinite suspension, and that he lacked the authority to consider mitigating factors that might weigh in favor of the appellant's request to remain on administrative leave....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of a viable penalty other than an indefinite suspension following loss of a clearance was explored in <span class="Italic">Whitney v. DOD</span>, CH-0752-09-0248-I-5 (NP 9/12/2014), finding no available alternatives, but considering the options:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the due process issue in this case, employees do not have a property interest in access to classified information, and the termination of that access does not implicate any due process concerns. <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 9 (2014). Like a security clearance, the granting of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is a matter within the Executive's broad discretion to make determinations concerning national security. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, just as it is obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance, it is likewise clear that an employee has no property interest in eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, and the denial of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is not itself subject to due process requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, by virtue of being an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and thus removable only for cause, the appellant did have a property interest in his continued employment. <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10. Therefore, he was entitled to due process, including notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, prior to being removed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185 (although Mr. Gargiulo had no due process rights relating to the procedures used to determine whether to suspend or revoke his security clearance, he did have due process rights concerning his indefinite suspension). It is the appellant's removal, not his loss of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, that triggered due process protections. <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10. The Board may review the due process protections afforded in the removal proceedings without second guessing the underlying eligibility determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 15 (the Court did not have occasion in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to decide if the Board was authorized to consider a claim that an agency denied due process in taking an adverse action based on a security clearance determination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 26-28, which involved an indefinite suspension based in part on the suspension of a security clearance, the Board held that, if there are "viable alternatives" to the indefinite suspension, due process requires that the employee be afforded an opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives. The Board found that the right to invoke the deciding official's discretion exists only in such cases where there is doubt as to the appropriateness or necessity of the penalty, and that due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official testified in this case that he had "no basis" to remove the appellant in the sense that he made his decision based solely upon the guidance he received from his human resources representative. He testified that all positions within DFAS were considered NCS and that there were no positions in his directorate that were designated non-sensitive to which he could have reassigned the appellant. The deciding official further testified that the appellant's oral and written responses to the proposal notice did not affect his decision because "there was nothing I could do," and there were no positions that the appellant could be placed in that did not require eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. He testified that when he signed the decision letter he did not believe that he could decide not to sign it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not identified any viable alternatives to his removal in this case, and we find no such alternatives. Given the record evidence establishing that all positions within DFAS were classified as NCS, any alternative to removal that would have retained the appellant in his Accounting Technician position, reassigned him to another position within DFAS, or indefinitely assigned him to non-sensitive duties without his being assigned to a position in the civil service was either prohibited, impracticable, or outside the purview of DFAS management. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1) (defining "employee" as an individual appointed in the civil service); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1) (the "civil service" consists of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial and legislative branches); <span class="Italic">Bracey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 236 F.3d 1356, 1359 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency has effected an indefinite suspension without pay pending the completion of an investigation and/or resolution of an appellant's security clearance status, the Board has suggested that placement on administrative leave "may" be a viable alternative to suspension without pay. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 28. Here, however, there was no pending adjudication of the appellant's eligibility to occupy an NCS position. Rather, such eligibility had been denied and the appellant's removal had been proposed. Even assuming that there was a "practicable" alternative in the sense that someone in DFAS management may have had the authority to create a non-sensitive position for the appellant to occupy, <span class="Italic">see Haeuser v. Department of Law, Government of Guam</span>, 97 F.3d 1152, 1159 n.4 (9th Cir. 1996) (contrasting the terms "practicable" and "practical," with "practicable" referring to something that can be put into effect, and "practical" referring to something that is also sensible and worthwhile), the Board does not have the authority to determine whether such an alternative would be practicable, <span class="Italic">see Skees v.

The Board is not permitted to second-guess the agency's determination to classify positions as NCS.

<p class="Body-Text">The level of decision was elevated to the Federal Circuit. Back to the mat. <span class="Italic">Ryan,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was affirmed on review in <span class="Italic">Ryan v.

Cir. 2015), determining on July 13, 2015, that (although not addressing the due process comments by the Board), that an agency regulation or policy requiring reassignment is the only source of Board review as to mitigation or alternatives to an indefinite suspension based on a clearance suspension. <span class="Italic">Ryan</span> followed the cases earlier limiting mitigation authority for removals based on clearance revocations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB does not have authority "to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action," such as discharge or indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 520 (1988). Rather, the MSPB has the authority to review only whether: (1) the petitioner's position required a clearance; (2) the clearance was denied, suspended, or revoked; and (3) the procedural protections specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 were followed. <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Ryan does not dispute that the position required a clearance or that the clearance was suspended and then revoked. Instead, she argues MSPB precedent requires the MSPB to conduct a "mitigation analysis...in cases of indefinite suspensions." That is, the MSPB should have "assess[ed] the propriety of an indefinite suspension rather than [a less severe] alternative," such as transfer or demotion to another position that did not require a security clearance. It should have done so, she asserts, because the MSPB "[f]or decades...has applied a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> penalty review in indefinite suspension appeals" and should have done so in this case. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. 313 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, however, addressed the question of whether the MSPB's statutory authority "includes authority to modify or reduce a <span class="Italic">penalty</span> imposed on an employee by an agency's <span class="Italic">adverse action</span>." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 313 (emphases added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) (A "suspension" reviewable pursuant to &#x00A7; 7513(d) "means the placing of an employee, <span class="Italic">for disciplinary reasons</span>, in a temporary status without duties and pay.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7511(a)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Ryan asserts that, although the denial of a security clearance is not an adverse action, the indefinite suspension occasioned by the loss of a security clearance is an adverse action. She emphasizes the hardships occasioned by an indefinite suspension, noting the suspended employee "is out of work for what is likely assumed to be questionable circumstances by a prospective private sector employer who, suspending disbelief, may not be inclined to assume the risk of hiring someone who on short notice may return to government employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Ryan is correct that an indefinite suspension constitutes an adverse action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512,[3] in her case it was not imposed as a penalty for wrongdoing or poor job performance, but was caused by Ms. Ryan's loss of her security clearance, which resulted in her no longer possessing a qualification required for the position. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> was a decision addressing the consolidated cases of seven individual appellants who "were each removed by their agencies upon charges of job-related misconduct." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 313-14.

Dep't of Energy</span>, 2011 M.S.P.B. 95 (2011); <span class="Italic">Vega v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 115 (1988); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 10 M.S.P.B. 568 (1982)). Similarly, decisions of this court considering or mentioning a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis have involved penalties for misconduct rather than loss of a required qualification for a position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">MacLean v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 714 F.3d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information); <span class="Italic">Greenstreet v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 543 F.3d 705 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (damage of computer and other office equipment during "isolated outburst"); <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 35 F.3d 1543 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (falsification of documents); <span class="Italic">Beard v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 801 F.2d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (violation of agency rules regarding the use of mace).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Perez v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 480 F.3d 1309, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Dyk, J., dissenting) ("[A]gencies have the authority to indefinitely suspend employees...but...such suspensions are adverse actions appealable to the Board."); <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1153 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rationale underlying the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis reflects the general principle that penalties should be proportional to misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 313 (The MSPB has "authority to mitigate penalties when the [MSPB] determines that the agency imposed penalty is clearly excessive, disproportionate to the sustained charges, or arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable."). If no security clearance suspension were at issue and Ms. Ryan had been indefinitely suspended from duty based on the underlying alleged criminal misconduct, a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis might be proper, but those are not the facts with which this court has been presented in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent Ms. Ryan suggests the MSPB should nevertheless apply <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> to require that Ms. Ryan be considered for transfer to a position not requiring a security clearance, the MSPB is precluded from doing so by <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, an employee "was denied a top secret clearance because he falsified pre-employment security forms." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1580. This court explained that, where a security clearance is required for a position and the employee does not possess one, the MSPB "<span class="Italic">has no authority</span> to inquire into the feasibility of transfer to alternative positions" unless a "substantive right [to be transferred] is available from some other source, such as a statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1381 ("[A]n employee has a right to be transferred to a nonsensitive position only if that right is manifested in statute or regulation."); <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Egan</span> "does not create any substantive right to consideration for alternative employment" and an individual who does not meet the requirements of a position may be dismissed "unless additional rights are available from some other source."). Ms. Ryan cites no statute or regulation manifesting a right to transfer to a nonsensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hesse</span> is particularly relevant. Like Ms. Ryan, Mr. Hesse was employed by the government in a position that required a top secret security clearance. <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1374. After a series of alleged security violations by Mr. Hesse, his security clearance was suspended. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "Based on the suspension of Mr. Hesse's security clearance, the agency suspended him from his position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Applying the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, this court concluded "the [MSPB] is not authorized to review security clearance determinations <span class="Italic">or agency actions based on security clearance determinations</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1376 (emphasis added). The MSPB is therefore not authorized to review FEMA's determination with respect to the feasibility of Ms. Ryan's transfer to an alternative position, given the MSPB's finding that FEMA does not have a policy requiring it to consider reassignment in cases where security clearances have been lost or suspended.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Due process was not denied when administrative leave was a possibility, and reassignment was not precluded by agency policy, but reassignment was not an option chosen by the deciding official, <span class="Italic">Palafox v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 124 MSPR 54, 2016 MSPB 43, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2171"></span>Regarding the penalty, the appellant argues that he was denied a meaningful opportunity to persuade the deciding official to reassign him instead of imposing the proposed indefinite suspension. He contends that the deciding official did not have the authority to choose that alternative because, according to the proposal notice, reassignment would have been "inconsistent" with official agency policy. The agency asserts that, notwithstanding the proposing official's statement, there is in fact no agency policy prohibiting reassignment following a loss of access to classified information. However, even if agency policy did prohibit reassigning the appellant, that restriction would not constitute a due process violation, because due process does not require that a deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, to the extent administrative leave may have been a viable alternative to suspension without pay, the appellant was not denied his due process right to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with the authority to select that alternative. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 28. The appellant cites deposition testimony in which the deciding official indicated that he could not think of a scenario in which he would have considered keeping the appellant on administrative leave. However, the deciding official went on to clarify that his statement did not mean that the appellant "couldn't come up with some evidence that [he] would consider." In particular, he explained that he might carry an employee in the appellant's position on administrative leave if he believed that the allegations underlying the suspension of the employee's access to classified information were not well founded. Thus, we find that the deciding official did have discretion to select administrative leave as an alternative to suspension without pay. While the appellant did not succeed in persuading the deciding official to carry him on administrative leave, the record reflects that he was notified of the allegations underlying the suspension of his access to classified information, and received an opportunity to present rebuttal evidence before the final penalty determination was made.</p>
