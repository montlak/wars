<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-71"><span class="space">p.</span> Social Security Administration Determination</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The impact of Social Security Administration disability determinations on FERS disability retirement adjudications was considered as to <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> shifting burdens of proof in <span class="Italic">Trevan v. OPM</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 524-27 (Fed. Cir. 1995), concluding that SSA disability determinations do not bind OPM FERS decisions on disability retirement applications, although the SSA adjudications are entitled to some weight:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the passage of the 1983 Social Security Amendments, which brought federal employees hired after December 31, 1983 within the coverage of Social Security, Congress sought to create a civil service retirement program that supplemented Social Security benefits and more closely approximated private sector multi-tiered retirement plans. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 99-166, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 1-5, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 USCCAN 1405, 1405-1410. After studying the issue for a considerable period of time and assessing several proposals, Congress enacted FERS, the purpose of which was to "establish a Federal employees' retirement plan which is coordinated with title II of the Social Security Act...." Pub. L. No. 99-335, &#x00A7; 1OOA, 100 Stat. 514, 516 (1986). The FERS scheme reflects a tiered benefits system under which FERS benefits supplement baseline Social Security benefits. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8403 (FERS benefits payable in addition to Social Security benefits). Accordingly, disability retirement benefits payable under FERS are reduced by a statutory percentage of any Social Security disability benefit received. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8452(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite Congress' purpose of providing a coordinated system, in both this and an earlier case, <span class="Italic">Wilmot v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 35 MSPR 238 (1987), the Board held that receipt of Social Security benefits did not <span class="Italic">per se</span> establish disability under FERS. The Board arrived at this result because the standards for determining disability under the Social Security Act and regulations differ from the standard for determining disability under the civil service law and regulations. <span class="Italic">Wilmot</span>, 35 MSPR at 240; <span class="Italic">Trevan,</span> 65 MSPR at 406.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not consider persuasive the mere fact that the two standards differ, given that the definition of disability under the Social Security Act--inability to perform <span class="Italic">any</span> substantial gainful activity, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 423(d)(1)(A)--is stricter than, and logically encompasses, the FERS disability definition--inability to perform useful and efficient service in the employee's present position or a reasonable reassignment, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B), 8451(a)(2)(A). The Board has recognized that the Social Security Act disability definition is "more stringent" than that of FERS. <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> 6 MSPR at 419-20; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Diener v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 7 MSPB 396, 7 MSPR 551, 555 (1981) ("this Board has noted in <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>...that the standards for Social Security disability are much more strict than those of [civil service disability retirement] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...One might conclude from this legislative history that Congress considered an employee to be necessarily "disabled" under FERS, i.e., unable because of disease or injury to render useful or efficient service in his present position, if the Social Security Administration has determined that he is "disabled" under the Social Security Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final legislation, however, omitted any language linking the definitions of "disability" under FERS and the Social Security Act, and any other indication that OPM is required or expected to defer to the Social Security Administration's disability finding. Section 8451 of the FERS statute as enacted provides that "an employee shall be considered disabled <span class="Italic">only</span> if the employee is found <span class="Italic">by the Office</span> [of Personnel Management] to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position." H.R. 2672, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B), <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). The legislative history of FERS does not indicate the reason for this key change in the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion is consistent with the plain language of the FERS statute, which provides that OPM will determine "questions of disability and dependency" and "adjudicate all claims under the provisions of this chapter [FERS, Chapter 84] administered by [it]." 5 USC &#x00A7; 8461(c)-(d). OPM may request from the Social Security Administration "such information as [OPM] determines necessary in order to administer [FERS benefits]." 5 USC &#x00A7; 8461(h)(1). The statute also empowers OPM to direct whatever medical or other examinations are needed to inform its decision. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8461(d). Once a disability annuity is granted by OPM, an annuitant whose disability is not permanent is examined "under the direction of [OPM]" each year until reaching the age of 60. Finally, under section 8455, OPM determines cessation or recurrence of disability for the purpose of terminating or reinstituting disability retirement benefits. There is no indication in either the statute or the legislative history that these provisions empower OPM only in cases in which the employee has not received Social Security benefits, or that determinations made by the Social Security Administration regarding award and continuation of Social Security disability benefits govern OPM's administration of FERS benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus we conclude that the Board did not err in finding that OPM was not required to consider Appellant "disabled" under FERS, as a matter of law, based solely on his receipt of Social Security disability benefits. This is not to say, however, that receipt of Social Security disability benefits is irrelevant to a FERS disability determination. In light of Congress' express intent to coordinate FERS and Social Security benefits, OPM and the Board must consider an award of Social Security disability benefits, and any underlying medical data provided to OPM by the Social Security Administration or the employee, along with any other evidence of disability, in determining entitlement to FERS benefits. In this case, the Board considered Petitioner's receipt of Social Security benefits but found this evidence to be outweighed by the inconsistent and inadequate medical evidence provided by Petitioner. As indicated above, we may not review the Board's factual findings concerning disability or reweigh the medical evidence, and thus we do not disturb the Board's findings on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no legal, procedural, or similarly fundamental error in the rest of the Board's decision. The Board recognized that under <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290 (Fed. Cir. 1992), Petitioner's separation for disability established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability and shifted the burden to OPM to produce "enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that [Petitioner] did not qualify" for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 294. The Board found that OPM had satisfied its burden and concluded that Petitioner had failed to prove disability by preponderant evidence, emphasizing evidence (particularly the 1991 X-rays and treadmill stress test results) that was inconsistent with Petitioner's claim of disability, and the lack of clinical findings and other objective medical evidence supporting the claimed disabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that OPM may meet its burden of production by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence "provid[ing] a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements,"<span class="Italic"> Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 54 MSPR 686, 689-90 (1992). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Shea v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 MSPR 352, 355 (1994) ("OPM can rightfully deny benefits if it can present proof that the appellant has insufficient objective medical evidence of disability"). Although the Board has recognized that objective medical evidence is not the only factor to be assessed in determining disability, <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management</span>, 6 MSPR 404, 419, 422 (1981), it is clearly correct to consider such evidence, and the lack thereof, as probative in such determinations. Particularly when, as in this case, OPM has produced medical evidence that is inconsistent with subjective claims of disability, a reasonable fact finder could rely on a lack of objective medical evidence to the contrary in concluding that an employee is not prevented by a medical condition from working. Indeed, in many cases it may be difficult to tell when "neutral" evidence so lacks positive indication of disability that it suggests the contrary, i.e., that no disability exists. As noted above, on review that judgment is for the Board, not this court, to make.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the Board is satisfied that a reasonable fact finder could find against the employee based on the objective medical evidence, or lack thereof, in a given case (along with any other evidence proffered by OPM),[7] the Board must weigh "the totality of the evidence produced by both sides," <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294. In this case the Board considered all evidence, including Petitioner's subjective claims of pain and receipt of Social Security benefits, in reaching its determination. Thus the Board followed proper procedures in determining that on the facts before it Petitioner was not entitled to a FERS disability annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;OPM may use any information available to it, including medical and employment records submitted in the first instance by the employee or employing agency, as well as medical examinations and other information OPM directs the employee to provide. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8461(d) (authorizing OPM to "direct at any time such medical or other examinations as it considers necessary to determine the facts concerning disability or dependence"); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 844.203(a) (applicant is responsible for providing "whatever documentation OPM requires in order to determine whether the individual meets the eligibility requirements" for FERS disability annuity; failure to submit information is grounds for dismissing application).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Christopherson v. OPM</span>, 119 MSPR 635, 640-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13, 2013 MSPB 58 (2013), applied <span class="Italic">Trevan</span> to deny disability benefits for lack of sufficient supportive evidence despite approval of disability benefits from SSA and compensation by OWCP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Trevan</span>, our reviewing court agreed with the Board that OPM can meet its burden of production "by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence 'provid[ing] a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements.'" <span class="Italic">Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526 (quoting <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 686, 689-90 (1992)). Relying on <span class="Italic">Trevan</span>, the Board has held that the lack of any indication in the reports by the appellant's treating physicians as to how or why her medical condition affected her ability to perform her specific job duties satisfies OPM's burden of production to rebut the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption. <span class="Italic">Rucker</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 669, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the OWCP and SSA documents include numerous references to medical reports concerning the appellant's mental health conditions, there are no such medical reports in the record. We find that OPM rebutted the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption of disability by showing a lack of medical evidence explaining how the appellant was unable to perform her specific work requirements, prevented her from being regular in attendance, or caused her to act inappropriately, or in the alternative, that her medical conditions are inconsistent with work in general, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting. <span class="Italic">Rucker</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 669, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see Henderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 19 (2012). Accordingly, we must review the record evidence to determine whether, considering the totality of the evidence, the appellant has met her burden of establishing an entitlement to a disability retirement annuity under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, OPM argues, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant failed to produce any adequate medical documentation to support her claimed medical conditions related to PTSD and depression. We agree. In <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 508 F.3d 1034, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the court stated that "OPM's regulations define the type of 'medical documentation' required to establish disability. Such evidence must come from 'a licensed physician or other appropriate practitioner,' it must be 'justified according to established diagnostic criteria,' and it must 'not be inconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the only medical document in the record relevant to the appellant's diagnosed mental health conditions, the basis for the OWCP and SSA awards of benefits, is Dr. Lepely's June 2011 letter, in which he states that the appellant remains permanently disabled and unable to be gainfully employed. In the June 2011 letter, Dr. Lepely refers to a 2007 medical report in which he diagnosed the appellant with "Major Depression Recurrent without Psychosis, and Prolong[ed] Post Traumatic Stress Disorder." However, Dr. Lepely did not include his 2007 report with the June 2011 letter, and the report is not otherwise in the record. The administrative judge issued a notice that explicitly advised the appellant that a copy of Dr. Lepely's 2007 assessment of her medical condition would assist him in adjudicating the appeal. Nevertheless, the appellant did not submit Dr. Lepely's 2007 assessment. Nor did the appellant submit any of the other medical reports or assessments relevant to her mental health conditions that both OWCP and SSA apparently considered when determining her eligibility for benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that, in a disability retirement application under FERS, OPM and the Board must consider an award of either OWCP or Social Security disability benefits. <span class="Italic">See Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526; <span class="Italic">Suter v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6; 12 (2001). However, as is the case here, OPM and the Board may find that such evidence is outweighed by inconsistent and inadequate medical evidence. <span class="Italic">Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526; <span class="Italic">Suter</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6; 12. Further, even though the administrative judge relied upon the appellant's testimony concerning her medical conditions, the Board has held that an employee's subjective evidence of disability is entitled to consideration and weight in a disability retirement case when it is supported by competent medical evidence. <span class="Italic">Newkirk v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 16 (2006). In this case, there is no competent medical evidence to support the appellant's testimony with regard to her mental health conditions of depression and PTSD. Accordingly, because there is no competent medical evidence in the record to support the appellant's claim of debilitating depression and PTSD, the appellant has failed to establish entitlement to a disability retirement under FERS. Therefore, we reverse the initial decision and affirm OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Christopherson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was qualified by <span class="Italic">Fausnaugh v. OPM</span>, AT-844E-20-0707-I-1 (NP 4/26/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We disagree with OPM's reading of <span class="Italic">Christopherson</span> and find that it does not create an affirmative obligation for the appellant to provide all underlying medical documentation in order for a medical opinion or record to be deemed competent. In <span class="Italic">Christopherson</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 635, &#x00B6; 10, there appeared to be no medical reports in the record concerning the appellant's medical conditions; instead, there were only documents that referenced medical reports concerning such medical conditions. The Board in Christopherson found that OPM rebutted the presumption of disability by showing a lack of medical evidence explaining how the appellant was unable to perform her specific work requirements, prevented her from being regular in attendance, caused her to act inappropriately or, alternatively, that her medical conditions were inconsistent with work in general, in a particular line or work, or in a particular type of work setting. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, however, the appellant provided medical reports from two separate providers that described his PTSD diagnosis, detailed the significant impact of the 2016 active shooter incident on his PTSD, and supported his burden for proving his entitlement to disability retirement benefits....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trevan</span> was also relied on in <span class="Italic">Bailey v. OPM</span>, AT-844E-16-0231-I-2, n.2 (NP 6/14/2022), although the SSA determination did not alter the result in the MSPB disability determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We acknowledge that the Board must consider an award of Social Security disability benefits in determining an individual's eligibility for FERS disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 <span id="Page_4187"></span>F.3d 520, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Here, the SSA found that the appellant became disabled in March 2016, approximately 16 months after his 2014 resignation from the Federal service. Thus, we find that the SSA's award is not a significant factor in determining whether the appellant met his burden of proving entitlement to disability retirement under FERS. <span class="Italic">See Pettye v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (finding that, because the SSA's favorable determination was limited to a period of time when the appellant was no longer employed in a position subject to FERS, it was not a significant factor in determining whether the appellant was entitled to disability retirement under FERS). The appellant's medical documents filed with the SSA determination letter are also entitled to little weight because they are dated 4 to 5 years after the appellant's resignation and there is a lack of evidence linking the medical documentation to the appellant's condition while he was employed in a position subject to FERS. <span class="Italic">See Reilly v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 571 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (explaining that post-separation medical evidence may be probative of a prior disability when proximity in time, lay testimony, or some other evidence provides the requisite link to the relevant time period).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilmot v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 238, 240 (1987), added as to the effect of SSA disability determinations on Board adjudication of disability retirement appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant argues that the Social Security Administration (SSA) has determined that she is disabled, she has only submitted one page of the three page determination by the SSA. Therefore, we do not know the basis of the SSA's determination. Even if the Board had the complete decision of the SSA, this would not mandate that the Board find the appellant disabled for purposes of entitlement to a civil service disability retirement annuity.[2] A determination of disability by the SSA is based on social security law, and its rules. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 423, 1382c; 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 416.904 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> These standards are different from those for a determination of disability under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). Therefore, the SSA's determination is not binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dickens v. Department of Transportation,</span> 17 M.S.P.R. 468, 471 n.2 (1983) (decisions by state unemployment compensation authorities are not binding on the Board). Further, the administrative judge considered at least one of the medical reports prepared for the SSA and found that it did not establish that the appellant was disabled for useful and efficient service.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The degree the SSA determination informs the Board depends on the rationale offered for the SSA finding, <span class="Italic">Burckley v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 617, 622 &#x00B6; 10 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does show that, by letter dated July 16, 1996, the Social Security Administration (SSA) notified the appellant that he was entitled to receive monthly disability benefits. In making a determination of eligibility for disability retirement under FERS, the Board must consider an award of SSA disability benefits together with medical evidence provided by the appellant to OPM, and other evidence of disability. <span class="Italic">See Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Here, however, the SSA notice does not set forth the reasons for its finding, but states merely that the appellant "became disabled according to our rules on August 5, 1993. Thus, the Board is unable to determine the basis for SSA's determination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wilmot v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 238, 240 (1987). Accordingly, we find that the SSA notice of eligibility for disability retirement benefits is not a significant factor in determining whether the appellant met his burden of proving entitlement to disability retirement benefits under FERS. <span class="Italic">See Harrison v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 442, 446 (1997), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 135 F.3d 776 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an SSA determination is introduced with a PFR as new evidence, the Board may remand the case for the AJ to consider evidence submitted to SSA that was not submitted to the AJ, although a remand was not necessary in <span class="Italic">Gergawy v. OPM</span>, SF-844E-13-1821-I-1 (NP 1/7/2015), when the Board examined what was offered by the appellant as the new documentation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the SSA decision is not material. To be material, the new evidence must be of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980). While not dispositive, an SSA determination awarding social security benefits is relevant evidence to be considered by the Board and OPM in disability retirement cases if the conditions underlying both applications are the same.[7] <span class="Italic">Confer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). In the instant case, SSA identified bipolar disorder as the basis of the appellant's disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;An SSA determination is not binding on the Board because it is based on different laws and regulations. <span class="Italic">Wilmot v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 238, 240 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If SSA cites to medical documentation in its determination, underlying its decision to award benefits, which was not submitted to the Board, it is in the interest of justice to allow the appellant to submit the evidence to the Board on remand for consideration of entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Gardner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 8 (2002). In the instant case, the SSA decision referenced evidence which was not submitted to the Board, including the testimony of an impartial medical expert, and "the examining and reviewing agency opinions." According to the administrative law judge, the medical expert found the personal psychiatrist's opinion to be more persuasive than the examining and reviewing agency opinions. The administrative law judge based his determination in part on the medical expert's opinion. Therefore, we issued an order to the parties to submit medical documentation underlying the SSA determination. The only new documentation submitted by the appellant was his function report for his SSA application, which he completed. OPM responded that it had no additional documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the SSA determination does not warrant a different outcome from the initial decision. Although the SSA determination is based on the same underlying condition, we nonetheless agree with the administrative judge that the inadequacy of the medical evidence to prove that the appellant was unable to perform the essential functions of his position outweighs the SSA determination. <span class="Italic">See Guthrie v.
