<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7511 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>

<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations also define who is covered by adverse action regulations. The regulatory definition, like the statute and cases that follow, is rather indirect. 5 CFR 752.401 (2022), describes how employees qualify for adverse action regulatory protection, including the appeal right described by 5 CFR 752.405 (2022) and conferred by 5 USC 7513:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Employees covered</span>. This subpart covers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A career or career conditional employee in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An employee in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Except as provided in section 1599e of title 10, United States Code, who has completed one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An employee in the excepted service who is a preference eligible in an Executive agency as defined at section 105 of title 5, United States Code, the U.S. Postal Service, or the Postal Regulatory Commission and who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;An employee in the excepted service who is a nonpreference eligible in an Executive agency as defined at section 105 of title, 5, United States Code, and who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Employees excluded</span>. This subpart does not apply to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(11)&#x2003;A nonpreference eligible employee serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment in the excepted service pending conversion to the competitive service, unless he or she meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(13)&#x2003;An employee in the competitive service serving a probationary or trial period, unless he or she meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under relatively recent decisions, a discharged probationer may have an appeal right based on service prior to the probationary appointment if that prior service qualifies to confer a Board appeal right. In an effort to synthesize some recent cases, particularly those involving interpretation and application of the Federal Circuit decision in the <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> case, <span class="Italic">post</span>, in September 2006 the Board issued the report "Navigating the Probationary Period after <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> and <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>," available on the Board's website, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Navigating_the_Probationary_Period_After_Van_Wersch_and_McCormick_(2007)_276106.pdf.">https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Navigating_the_Probationary_Period_After_Van_Wersch_and_McCormick_(2007)_276106.pdf</a>.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hurston v. Dept. of Army</span>, 113 MSPR 34, 38-39 &#x00B6; 9, 2010 MSPB 1 (2010), summarizes how an employee in the competitive service can demonstrate appeal rights either through completion of probation (including by tacking of prior service, a subject discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-086.html#sec1-85">Tacking of Prior Service: Competitive Service Probation</a>") or through an independent right to appeal as an "employee":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The primary issue on review is whether the appellant qualifies as a competitive service "employee" with appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75. To qualify as an "employee," the appellant must show that she either is not serving a probationary period or has completed 1 year of current continuous service under an appointment other than a temporary one limited to a year or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">see McCormick v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied,</span> 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Baggan,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 5. An appellant who has not served a full year under her appointment can show that she has completed the probationary period, and so is no longer a probationer, by tacking on prior service if: (1) the prior service was rendered immediately preceding the probationary appointment; (2) it was performed in the same agency; (3) it was performed in the same line of work; and (4) it was completed with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days. <span class="Italic">Baggan,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Ellefson v. Department of the Army,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 16 (2005)); <span class="Italic">McCrary v. Department of the Army,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b). Alternatively, an employee can show that, while she may be a probationer, she is an "employee" with Chapter 75 appeal rights because, immediately preceding the adverse action, she had completed at least 1 year of current continuous service in the competitive service without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">Baggan,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Ellefson,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 14).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rioux v. DOD</span>, PH-315H-10-0465-I-1 (NP 3/31/2011), provides the analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant was serving a probationary period at the time of his termination, and thus fails to meet the criteria under <span id="Page_53"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). Although the appellant alleges that he has prior federal service and his resume indicates that he worked for the U.S. Postal Service from June 2003 to October 2004, the appellant cannot tack this prior federal service to his probationary period because it was with a different agency and followed by a break in service of more than 30 calendar days. <span class="Italic">See Ellefson v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 16 (2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b). In addition, the record shows that the appellant fails to meet the requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) because he had less than 1 year of continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less at the time he was terminated. The appellant cannot show that, although he may be a probationer, he is still an "employee" with chapter 75 appeal rights based on his completion of 1 year of current continuous service for the U.S. Postal Service because this prior federal service was followed by a break in federal civilian employment of more than a workday.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note the distinction between tacking, subsequently discussed, and a year or more of prior service in a competitive service position. For there to be tacking of any period of time, the prior employment must be in the same line of work and in the same agency. Those conditions do not restrict the appeal right that is secured through a service of at least one year in a competitive service position, other than in a temporary position of one year or less, immediately prior to the position held at the point of an appealable action, e.g., termination, downgrading, or lengthy suspension.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ann McCormick entered the federal competitive service on June 2, 1991, as a career conditional employee of the Department of Health and Human Services. Her appointment was subject to completion of a one-year probationary period, which she subsequently completed. On August 30, 1999, McCormick requested a voluntary change of appointment to the position of contract negotiator at Tinker Air Force Base. The request for change of appointment was accompanied by a Request for Personnel Action (Form 52) dated August 29, 1999, which referred to the action as a "termination/transfer out." She was appointed to the position of contract negotiator effective August 29, 1999. As part of her appointment to the Department of the Air Force, the department issued a Notification of Personnel Action referring to McCormick as a conditional employee subject to a one-year probationary period beginning August 29, 1999. On February 22, 2000, McCormick's employment with the Air Force was terminated. The Notice of Personnel Action (Form 50) issued by the Air Force stated that the termination was during her probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCormick appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board on March 23, 2000. On November 30, 2000, the Board issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, No. DA-315H-00-0317-I-1 (Initial Decision). The Board held that McCormick was a probationary employee and, as such, had only limited appeal rights as provided under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806. <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 6?7. The Board denied review, <span class="Italic">McCormick v.

On May 15, 2002, McCormick timely filed a petition for rehearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review the decisions of the Board regarding its own jurisdiction without deference. <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Petitioner bears the burden of establishing Board jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] ; <span class="Italic">Clark v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jurisdiction of the Board is granted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), which provides "[a]n employee...may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." Removal from employment is an appealable action where the individual qualifies as an "employee" at the time of her removal by the agency. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d) (1994)). The term "employee" is defined by statute under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a) (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here petitioner does not meet the definition of employee under subsection (A)(i), but does meet the definition under subsection (A)(ii). The question presented here is whether an individual who is excluded from "employee" status under subsection (A)(i) is an "employee" if she meets the definition provided in subsection (A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her petition for rehearing, McCormick cites our decision in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, in which we construed the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) as providing two alternative definitions of employee status and held that an individual could establish Board jurisdiction by satisfying either alternative. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151. The court in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> construed the conjunction "or" as being disjunctive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1148 (citing Webster's 3rd New Int'l Dict. 1585 (1986)). The court considered the government's arguments that the two definitions were not alternatives, but dismissed those arguments stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We have carefully considered the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) and the government's argument based on that history. Indeed...we recognize the force of the government's argument as far as what the legislative history tells us about Congressional intent. If the language of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) could fairly be read as ambiguous, the government would have a compelling case...[h]owever, the language of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) cannot be so read. On the contrary...it is crystal clear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1152. Given our holding in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> with respect to subsection (C) of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), there is no basis for a different result when construing the language of subsection (A) of that same statute. Both 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) and (C) provide two definitions separated by the conjunction "or." Under <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> we must treat subsection A as providing alternative definitions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government does not argue that McCormick fails to meet the definition provided by &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), but rather argues that she must meet the definitions provided by both subsections (i) and (ii). In response to petitioner's reliance on <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, the government argues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, this Court interpreted certain changes made to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 in the Civil Service Due Process Act of 1990 ("DPA"), and mistakenly interpreted the definition of employee to include even those probationary employees that were clearly intended to be excluded from the appeal rights of tenured employees. The Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> even notes that its conclusion is contrary to the legislative history of the act and contrary to longstanding OPM administration of Federal personnel statutes. Because it mandates a reading to the statute that is clearly inconsistent with that of the administering agency and clearly inconsistent with the legislative history, <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> was incorrectly decided by this Court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government further argues that, contrary to the panel's position in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch,</span> the language of the statute was not clear and deference should be afforded to the OPM regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In fact, the language of the stature [sic], as opposed to the meaning of the particle [sic] 'or,' is far from clear.... It could mean that the clauses connected by the word 'or' refer to different classes of employees, rather than all Federal employees, as the panel assumed. Therefore, the panel should have treated the case as falling within Chevron II and...deferred to OPM....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 5-6 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The panel is bound by the court's earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>. <span class="Italic">In re Am. Fertility Soc'y,</span> 188 F.3d 1341, 1347, 51 USPQ2d 1832, 1836 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding that an earlier precedential decision is binding precedent on later panels) (citing <span class="Italic">Newell Cos. v. Kenney Mfg. Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). The government's invitation to overturn <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> must be addressed to the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_54"></span>In summary, under <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> the Merit Systems Protection Board has jurisdiction when an employee meets the definition of "employee" provided by subsection (i) or (ii). The government does not argue that McCormick fails to meet the definition of employee under subsection (ii), and the record shows that she does meet that definition, having completed more than 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. The Board, therefore, has jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the briefest of summaries of <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, we have <span class="Italic">Liu v. USDA</span>, 106 MSPR 178, 181-82 &#x00B6; 6, 2007 MSPB 159 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), an "employee" is an individual in the competitive service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant has Board appeal rights if she meets either prong of this definition. <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (an individual who does not meet one prong of the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) has appeal rights if she meets the other prong). On review, the appellant argues that she satisfies both prongs of this definition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCormick</span> was restated in <span class="Italic">Avalos v. DHUD</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200626188">963 F.3d 1360</a>, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government alternatively argues that the Board lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Avalos had not completed a one-year probationary period in the competitive service to accrue appeal rights. But Mr. Avalos need only show that he has completed more than one year of "<span class="Italic">current continuous service</span> under other than a temporary appointment" to establish that he was an employee with the right to appeal his removal from HUD. <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402, "current continuous service" means "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in [f]ederal civilian employment of a workday." This definition does not exclude service as a political appointee: even if political appointees have no right to appeal adverse actions to the Board, they remain part of the civil service and qualify as "[f]ederal civilian employ[ees]" under any reasonable interpretation of that term. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101 ("For the purpose of [title 5]...the 'civil service' consists of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services...."); <span class="Italic">Wilder v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 675 F.3d 1319, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7511--that "[f]ederal civilian employment" as opposed to military service counts toward "current continuous service"--reasonable and consistent with the statute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After working at the USDA for almost eight years, Mr. Avalos resigned on September 17, 2016, and began working at HUD the next day. Given this years-long period of "federal civilian employment," Mr. Avalos had completed significantly more than one year of "current continuous service" at the time of his removal. As a result, Mr. Avalos had the right to appeal his removal to the Board; the Board had the jurisdiction to review it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellefson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over appeals that are authorized by law, rule or regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a); <span class="Italic">Antolin v. Department of Justice</span>, 895 F.2d 1395, 1396 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Prior to 1999, it was considered well established that a probationary employee had no statutory right to appeal an adverse action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 420, 422, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). A probationer had a regulatory right of appeal only if he made a non-frivolous allegation that he was terminated due to discrimination based on marital status or for partisan political reasons, or because of conditions arising before appointment to the position in question. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.804-.806; <span class="Italic">Von Deneen</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 422. In the latter instance, the only ground for appeal was that the agency did not follow the procedural requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 274, 276 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1999, the Federal Circuit reviewed a Board decision dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, the appeal of a non-preference eligible employee in the excepted service who was serving a probationary period. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In doing so, the court examined the meaning of the statutory term "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a). The statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a non-preference eligible in the excepted service, Ms. Van Wersch was entitled to appeal to the Board if, at the time of her termination, she qualified as an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(C). The court observed that subsections (i) and (ii) in paragraph (C) are separated by the word "or," and it found that the plain meaning of "or" is disjunctive and implies alternatives. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1148. Thus, the court held that an individual is an "employee" if he meets the requirements of either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) <span class="Italic">or</span> (ii). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1151. The court acknowledged that its literal reading of the statute produced a result that appeared to be contrary to the legislative history of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990, and it stated that if the language of section 7511(a)(1)(C) could fairly be read as ambiguous, "the government would have a compelling case for its reading of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1152. However, the court found that, far from being ambiguous, the language of section 7511(a)(1)(C) was "crystal clear," and that the legislative history could not "trump the irrefutably plain language that emerged when Congress actually took pen to paper." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied</span>, 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003), which was issued while the petition for review in this appeal was pending, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> compelled the same result with respect to competitive service employees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). The court held that a probationary individual who is excluded from "employee" status under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) is nevertheless an "employee" with Board appeal rights if the individual meets the definition provided at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342-43. Thus, a competitive service individual serving a probationary period is an "employee" entitled to appeal to the Board if he has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). In so holding, the court overruled Board precedent which had found that Congress intended subsection (i) to apply exclusively to appointments that require a probationary or trial period and subsection (ii) to apply exclusively to appointments that do not require probationary or trial periods. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Youngs v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 551, 556 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Ms. McCormick, the Federal Circuit concluded that she met the definition of "employee" under subsection (ii) because she was an individual who "has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less." <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342-43. The court, however, did not define the phrase "current continuous service." The plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) refers only to "current continuous service," with no requirement that such service must be in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">See Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (recognizing that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) does not include the "same or similar positions" requirement for individuals in the competitive service). By contrast, subsections (B) and (C)(ii) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) explicitly refer to "current continuous service in the same or similar positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, the definition of "employee" for subchapter I of Chapter 75 (setting forth procedures for suspensions for 14 days or less), which otherwise mirrors the language at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), explicitly refers to "current continuous employment in the same or similar positions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(1). Thus, when Congress intended to impose a same or similar positions requirement, it knew how to, and did so clearly and unequivocally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) <span id="Page_55"></span>does not explain why the "same or similar positions" language was not included in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). The Senate Report stated that section 7511(a)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...continues the present coverage of certain other appointments, for which there is no probationary or trial period, after they complete one year of current continuous employment. The changes in the wording of this subsection from existing law provide coverage to employees serving under several kinds of appointments not in existence at the time the present law was enacted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 48 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2770.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1978 civil service regulations, issued prior to passage of the CSRA, provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a) Employees covered. This subpart [subpart B setting forth the procedures for removals, suspensions for more than 30 days, furloughs without pay, and reductions in rank or pay] applies to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)(i) Any career, career-conditional overseas limited, indefinite, or term employee, or any employee serving under a career executive assignment, in a competitive position who is not serving a probationary or trail [sic] period and (ii) any employee serving in a competitive position who has completed <span class="Italic">1 year of current continuous employment</span> except one serving under a temporary appointment with a definite time limitation or a limited executive assignment;...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.201 (1978) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the 1978 regulations did not include a "same or similar positions" requirement for competitive service employees. Nor did the regulations define the phrase "current continuous employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.102 (1978) (definitions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1988, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) amended its Part 752 regulations to include the following definition of current continuous employment: "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action <span class="Italic">in the same or similar positions</span> without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b) (emphasis supplied). In its Federal Register notice, OPM stated that this definition applied only to a small class of competitive service employees who had appointments that did not require that they serve a probationary or trial period. OPM explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM realizes that the law providing coverage for employees in the competitive service is somewhat confusing and not self-explanatory. The confusion arises because there are employees in the competitive service who serve in two types of appointments. The majority serve under career, career-conditional, or certain other nontemporary appointments which require a probationary or trial period of service. Of this group, only those employees who have yet to complete the necessary probationary or trail [sic] period (required either because their current appointment is their first period of Government service, or because they have been appointed from a register to a different position) are excluded from Part 752 protections. Once they complete the current probationary period, they do not have to serve another probationary period, even after a break in Government service, unless they are again appointed from a register. (<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR Part 315.) <span class="Italic">The definitions of "current continuous employment" and "similar positions" do not apply to this group.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A much smaller group of competitive service employees serve in appointments (such as temporary appointments pending establishment of a register (TAPER), <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, or special tenure appointments) which require no probationary or trial period. <span class="Italic">It is this second group of employees to which our regulatory definitions are addressed</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">53 Fed. Reg. 21,619 (June 9, 1988) (emphasis supplied). Because OPM viewed the current continuous service requirement as a substitute for a probationary period, it made sense that such service must be served in the same or similar positions. In <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, however, the Federal Circuit rejected the view that Congress intended subsection (ii) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) to apply only to appointments that do not require a probationary or trial period. Moreover, the court concluded that Ms. McCormick had 1 year of current continuous service without analyzing whether her prior appointment as a "Social Insurance Specialist" with the Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services was similar to her appointment as a "Contract Negotiator" with the Department of the Air Force. Therefore, it appears that the court did not construe "current continuous service" as requiring such service to be in the "same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), which omits the phrase "same or similar positions," and in order to be consistent with the Federal Circuit's opinion in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, we hold that current continuous service need not be in the same or similar positions in order for an individual in the competitive service to qualify as an "employee" under that subsection. We further hold that, for competitive service employees, "current continuous service" means a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b) (so defining "Current Continuous Employment," but including the "same or similar requirement").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the paucity of information in the record, we are unable to determine whether the appellant has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. The appellant indicated on his appeal form that he began his federal service on January 27, 1992 and this allegation is corroborated by the SF-50s provided by the agency, (indicating a service computation date of Jan. 27, 1992). The appeal must therefore be remanded for the administrative judge to determine whether, during the year immediately preceding his separation, the appellant's service was without a break in service of a workday and was under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. If so, the appellant would meet the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) and the Board would have jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant had a break in service, he may be an "employee" under subsection (i) of section 7511(a)(1)(A) if his prior service can be "tacked" to his probationary period. Prior service in competitive service positions can be credited towards completion of a later probationary or trial period in a competitive service position if the employee shows that: (1) The prior service was rendered immediately preceding the appointment; (2) it was performed in the same agency; (3) it was performed in the same line of work; and (4) it was completed with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b); <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 545, 547-48 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Illich v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6 (2004) (McPhie, Acting Chairman, separate opinion) (explaining that 5 C.F.R. subpart 315H, which is entitled "Probation of an Initial Appointment to a <span class="Italic">Competitive</span> Position" (emphasis added), applies only to certain employees serving in or separated from competitive service positions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, the initial decision is vacated and the appeal is remanded for further adjudication. If, after considering evidence and argument from the parties, the administrative judge determines that the appellant is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) or (ii), then it would be appropriate to again dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. However, if the administrative judge determines that the appellant is an "employee," then the agency's action must be reversed. an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond<span class="Italic">. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The record shows that the appellant received prior written notice of his proposed separation on November 14, 2000. The notice did not provide the appellant with an opportunity to reply, and he was separated two days later on November 16, 2000. Thus, if the appellant is an "employee," the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's separation did not comport with a tenured employee's constitutional right to minimum due process of law because the appellant was not provided with an opportunity to respond, and the agency's action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">Daniel v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 459, 461-62 (1995) (reversing agency action where appellant was not provided with an opportunity to respond to the charges).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCormick</span> does not require that sequential competitive service positions be the "same or similar" for appeal rights to follow upon completion of one year of service, <span class="Italic">Porter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency first argues that the appellant does not meet the definition of an "employee" because her prior service was not in the same agency and in the same line of work. This argument, however, only addresses whether she meets the definition of an "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i),<span class="Italic"></span> i.e., whether she was serving a probationary period at the time of her separation. Even assuming that the agency is correct that the appellant is not entitled to "tack" her prior service toward her probationary period and that she does not meet the definition of an "employee" at subsection (i), she nevertheless qualifies as an "employee" under the definition at subsection (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to satisfy subsection 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)'s definition of employee, an individual does not have to complete one year of current continuous service in a "same or similar position," as <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> makes clear. On June 2, 1991, Ms. McCormick was appointed to the position of "Social Insurance Specialist" with the Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services (HHS). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1340. On August 29, 1999, HHS terminated her from that position and, the same day, the Department of the Air Force appointed her to a "Contract Negotiator" position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. About six months later, on February 22, 2000, the Air Force terminated Ms. McCormick from the "Contract Negotiator" position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Reviewing this evidence, the Federal Circuit concluded that Ms. McCormick met 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)'s requirement of one year of current continuous service by tacking together Ms. McCormick's prior service at HHS with her service at the Air Force. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1343 (stating that "the record shows" that Ms. McCormick completed more than 1 year of current continuous service). <span id="Page_56"></span>The court came to this conclusion without exhaustively analyzing whether the positions of "Social Insurance Specialist" and "Contract Negotiator" were similar or in the same line of work, thereby indicating that the court did not consider the phrase "current continuous service" in subsection (ii) to include a "same or similar positions" requirement. The <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> court's literal interpretation of subsection (ii) is consistent with its literal reading of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) in general because subsection (ii) does not include the "same or similar" language, in contrast to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) and (C)(ii), which specifically include the "same or similar" language. <span class="Italic">See also Mathis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 16, 2003, the appellant was appointed to the competitive service position of Deputy United States Marshal, GS-0082-07, with the agency's United States Marshals Service (USMS). The appointment SF-50 indicates that his appointment was subject to a 1-year probationary period. Effective February 12, 2004, the agency terminated the appellant based upon alleged misconduct on June 27, 2003, during his probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 9, 2004, the appellant filed an initial appeal with the New York Field Office. The administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order informing the appellant that the Board might lack jurisdiction over his appeal because he was a probationary employee, and ordered him to file evidence and argument on the issue. The appellant responded that he qualified as an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(i), as he had completed the probationary period based on his prior service as a Detention Enforcement Officer with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Based on the written record, the administrative judge determined that the INS and USMS were separate agencies within the Department of Justice at the time of the appellant's appointment to the INS position, and that the appellant's service with INS therefore could not be credited toward completion of his probationary period with USMS. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction, without addressing whether the appellant qualified as an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that the INS and USMS were separate agencies for "tacking" purposes, and more generally, in dismissing the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed.

The phrase "current continuous service" means a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in Federal civilian employment of a weekday. <span class="Italic">Ellefson v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 191 &#x00B6; 14 (2005).<span class="Italic"></span> There is no requirement that such service be in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nor is it necessary for current continuous service to be within a single agency. <span class="Italic">See McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342-43 (appellant met definition of "employee" based on current continuous service within two different agencies). It is undisputed that there was no break in service between the appellant's employment with INS and his appointment to the USMS position. Furthermore, both appointments were career-conditional. Consequently, the appellant qualifies as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). In light of this conclusion, there is no need to address whether he meets the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623<span class="Italic"></span> (2003), the agency argued below that prior to his appointment as a Deputy U.S. Marshal, the appellant waived his right to appeal his removal during the first year of his appointment. However, after the agency made its submission to the administrative judge, the Board's <span class="Italic">Ramos</span> decision was reversed. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 2005 WL 1316981 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (non-precedential). Furthermore, the Memorandum of Understanding that the appellant signed was not a waiver of appeal rights. The Memorandum of Understanding provided in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5. The candidate, in order to be retained in the USMS, must satisfactorily carry out assignments prescribed as part of the in-district Class Recruit Training and Evaluation Program. Candidates failing to successfully meet the criteria established in the program will be terminated prior to completion of their first year of USMS service as a full-time Deputy U.S. Marshal. Termination actions will be in conjunction with applicable Office of Personnel Management regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Memorandum of Understanding did not state that the appellant waived the appeal rights that he otherwise possessed, nor did it specify which OPM regulations would be "applicable" to actions within the appellant's first year of service. In addition, the Memorandum of Understanding covered performance of assignments under a training and evaluation program, and not removal for misconduct. We therefore find that the appellant did not waive his right to appeal his removal by signing this document.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Typical of a group of decisions applying <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> is <span class="Italic">Gardner v. DOD</span>, 98 MSPR 215, 217-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7-9 (2005), concluding there was jurisdiction over the appeal of a competitive service term employee serving a trial period, terminated during the first year of service in that job, with prior competitive service in what appeared to be a permanent appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 4, 2000, the appellant received a competitive service, term appointment to a GS-9 Personnel Security Specialist position with the agency. Her term appointment was subject to her completion of a one-year trial period.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely filed a Board appeal of her termination. The administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order informing the appellant that the Board might lack jurisdiction over her appeal because she was a probationary employee. The administrative judge advised the appellant that the Board would have jurisdiction over a probationer's termination only if she made a non-frivolous claim that the action was based on partisan political reasons or marital status. The administrative judge informed the appellant that she had the burden of proving that the Board had jurisdiction over her appeal and directed her to file evidence and argument to meet that burden. The appellant responded that she had been employed by the federal government since June 1991 and that the agency never disclosed that, in accepting the December 4, 2000 appointment, she would be placed on probationary status and lose her appeal rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1342-43 (Fed.

Cir. 2003), which was issued while the petition for review in this appeal was pending, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). The court held that a probationary individual who is excluded from "employee" status under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) is nevertheless an "employee" with Board appeal rights if the individual meets the definition provided at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> specifically addressed an individual who was excluded from the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) because she was terminated while serving in a probationary period, <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>'s reasoning applies with equal force to an individual serving in a trial period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) ("employee" means a competitive service individual "who is not serving a probationary <span class="Italic">or</span> <span class="Italic">trial period</span>...")

Thus, under <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>'s reasoning, an individual, like the appellant, who is serving in a trial period and is excluded from "employee" status under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i), would nevertheless be an "employee" entitled to appeal to the Board under the adverse action procedures of Chapter 75 of Title 5 if that individual meets the definition provided at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)--that is, he is an individual in the competitive service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. Further, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)'s phrase "current continuous service" means a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">Ellefson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this reasoning to the facts of the present case, we conclude that the appellant is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). Prior to the appointment from which the appellant was terminated here, the record shows that the appellant had been assigned to a Security Assistant position with the Department of the Navy on January 31, 1999. She was terminated from that position on December 2, 2000. On December 4, 2000, the agency appointed the appellant to the position at issue in the present case. The agency terminated her from that position on November 30, 2001. Although the appellant had a break in service on December 3, 2000, that was a Sunday and not a workday. <span class="Italic">[C]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">f</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6302(a) (days of leave "are days on which an employee would otherwise work and receive pay and are exclusive of holidays and nonworkdays..."); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(a) (defining "day," as opposed to the term "workday" used in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b), as a calendar day); <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v.

Therefore, the appellant completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. On this basis, we find that the appellant is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), and that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal. In light of this conclusion, there is no need to address the appellant's arguments concerning the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nearly 7 months after the appellant's appointment, on February 12, 2002, the agency issued an SF-50 canceling the appellant's appointment by transfer, stating that the "nature of [the] action and [the] authority were incorrect." The agency then issued a new appointment SF-50 stating that the appellant's appointment to the General Engineer position was subject to the completion of a 1-year probationary period beginning on June 17, 2001, the date on which prior documents had effected the appellant's placement in the position by transfer. On February 25, 2002, the agency terminated the appellant for unsatisfactory conduct and performance during his probationary period. The decision letter stated that the appellant did not have a right to reply to the letter and that he could appeal to the Board only if he believed his separation was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that an individual who is excluded from "employee" status under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) is nevertheless an "employee" if the individual meets the definition provided at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342-43. In other words, a competitive service employee serving a probationary period is nevertheless entitled to appeal to the Board if he "has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Office of Personnel Management regulations define "current continuous employment" as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b).</p>

Moreover, the rule of <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> is retroactive and must be applied to all pending cases, whether or not those cases involve predecision events. <span class="Italic">See Reynoldsville Casket Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). The record supports his allegation that he has 2 years and 8 months of federal service. Prior to the appellant's 8 months of service with the agency, he was employed by the Department of the Navy. The agency does not claim that there was a break in service between the two positions. Thus, the appellant completed 1 year of current continuous service immediately preceding his termination without a break in federal employment of a workday, he therefore qualifies as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), and the agency's action involuntarily separating the appellant is an adverse action covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond<span class="Italic">. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The record shows that the appellant received written notice of his separation on May 25, 2002, which was the same date that the separation took effect. The notice stated that the appellant did not have a right to reply to the letter. Therefore, the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's separation did not comport with a tenured employee's constitutional right to minimum due process of law because he was not provided with an opportunity to respond. Accordingly, the agency's removal action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daniel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After completing 12 years of federal service, the appellant was appointed to the competitive service position of Secretary with the Department of Veterans Affairs (the agency) effective June 18, 2000. According to the appointment SF-50, her appointment was subject to her completion of a one-year initial probationary period. On May 25, 2001, the agency terminated the appellant from her position during her probationary period for "unsatisfactory work practices."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Throughout the proceedings, the appellant has maintained that she held positions in various agencies during her 12-year civil service career prior to her appointment with the agency. The record evidence shows that, on June 17, 2000, the appellant was terminated from her Secretary position with the Department of the Navy and that she was appointed to a Secretary position with the agency on June 18, 2000. The agency concedes that there was no break in service between the two positions. Thus, the appellant completed 1 year of current continuous service immediately preceding her termination without a break in federal employment of a workday, and she therefore qualifies as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), the Board must reverse the agency's action as a violation of her constitutional right to minimum due process of law. an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives her of her property right in her employment constitutes an abridgement of her constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The record shows the appellant received prior written notice of her proposed separation on May 10, 2001. The notice did not provide her with an opportunity to reply, and she was separated two weeks later on May 25, 2001. Therefore, the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's separation did not comport with a tenured employee's constitutional right to minimum due process of law because she was not provided with an opportunity to respond. Accordingly, the agency's removal action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Daniel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;The appeal must be remanded for consideration of the appellant's age discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 461, 464 (1987), the Board held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a) gives an appellant the right to a decision on a claim of discrimination, even when the Board has already determined that the action appealed must be reversed on other grounds. <span class="Italic">See also Shingles v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 245 &#x00B6; 8 (2001); <span class="Italic">Totten v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 255, 257 (1995); <span class="Italic">Polite v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 653, 658 (1991). Here, the appellant attempted to raise a claim of age discrimination, but in light of the AJ's jurisdictional dismissal, the claim was not adjudicated. It appears from the record <span id="Page_58"></span>that the appellant filed this appeal after filing a formal complaint of discrimination, and before 120 days had passed without an agency decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). It also appears, however, that the AJ's dismissal occurred 116 days after the appellant filed her formal complaint of discrimination. Had the AJ found, as we now do, that the appellant had the right to appeal her removal, it appears that the appropriate course would have been to "hold the appeal for a short time" (i.e., 4 days) until it was ripe. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(c). In any event, more than 120 days have now passed, and on this record, we have no basis for concluding that the appellant's age discrimination claim cannot be considered.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand below and on review, the agency asserted that the Board erred in applying the holding in <span class="Italic">McCormick v.

The agency has shown no error in the Board's application of <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> to the instant appeal. The Board relies on the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation</span> 509 U.S. 86 (1993) for determining whether a new rule of law should be applied retroactively. In <span class="Italic">Harper</span>, the Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">After giving careful consideration to the agency's arguments on this issue, we now agree that our prior decisions in <span class="Italic">Smart I</span> and <span class="Italic">Smart II</span> erred in interpreting the retroactive application of <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> to this appeal<span class="Italic">.</span> In <span class="Italic">Porter v.

Specifically, the Board noted that the Supreme Court abandoned the balancing test established in <span class="Italic">Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson</span>, 404 U.S. 97 (1971) in <span class="Italic">Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation</span>, 509 U.S. 86, 97 (1993). <span class="Italic">Porter</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 13.

<p class="Block-Quote2">When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Harper,</span> 509 U.S. at 97. Following <span class="Italic">Harper</span>, the Supreme Court further explained the process for consideration of retroactivity in <span class="Italic">Reynoldsville Casket Co</span>., stating that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen (1) the Court decides a case and applies the (new) legal rule of that case to the parties before it, then (2) it and other courts must treat that same (new) legal rule as "retroactive," applying it, for example, to all pending cases, whether or not those cases involve predecision events.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde</span>, 514 U.S. 749, 752 (1995).
