<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-228"><span class="space">d.</span> MSPB Appeal; Interview; Deposition</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> analysis was reviewed as a result of a remand to FLRA in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Gov't Fin. Operations, Hq. and NTEU</span>, 15 FLRA 423 (1984) (for decision prior to remand,<span class="Italic"> see </span>13 FLRA 27 (1983)). The issue was whether an employee had a right to a union representative when he was being interviewed as a witness by an agency attorney and labor relations specialists in preparation for an MSPB hearing. The employee apparently saw an incident that played some part in the adverse action that was the subject of the Board appeal. NTEU was representing the appellant before the MSPB. The employee interviewed by management was designated as an MSPB witness by NTEU. FLRA determined that the interview of a witness was not a formal interview and that no representative need be allowed. FLRA concluded, in a ruling that would later be reversed in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181, 1191-93 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>, that the MSPB appeal did not involve a grievance or general conditions of employment, 15 FLRA at 432-33:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ection 7114(a)(2)(A) rights arise only when all of the statutory criteria exist. That is, there must be a discussion which is formal in nature between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees or their representatives in an exclusively represented bargaining unit concerning grievances, personnel policy or practices, or other general conditions of employment. The absence of any one of these criteria is fatal to a complaint alleging that an agency has failed to accord an exclusive representative its right to be represented. As noted above, in the instant case at least two of these criteria are not met. The subject matter of the meeting did not involve a grievance, personnel policy or practices, or other general conditions of employment....</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision of FLRA in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Gov't Fin. Operations and NTEU</span>, 13 FLRA 27 (1983), <span class="Italic">reconsidered and aff'd on remand</span>, 15 FLRA 423 (1984), that the agency need not notify the union and permit union presence at an interview of a unit employee in preparation for a hearing of the MSPB, was set aside in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181, 1184-93 (D.C. Cir. 1985). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Gov't Fin. Operations and NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA 512 (1986) (issuing a cease and desist order to the agency as a result of the court decision). The focus of the D.C. Circuit was on the definition of a grievance. The court noted that the union represented the appellant before the MSPB, but the court's decision involving the right of the union to notice and the opportunity to be present at management's interview of a unit employee concerning the case was not dependent on the union's representational role before the MSPB. The court's decision centered on what constitutes a grievance, not whether a union presents or litigates the grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...FLRA's interpretation of "grievance" misconstrues the statute. We also find that the FLRA's determination that the discussion was not a formal one lacks substantial evidence on the record and is contrary to the FLRA's own precedent....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Section 7103 of the FLMRS defines a grievance as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(9)&#x2003;"grievance" means any complaint--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;by any employee concerning any matter related to the employment of the employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in this definition restricts a "grievance" to matters raised through a negotiated procedure. Murphy appealed to the MSPB contending that the Bureau improperly fired him because his conduct did not rise to a level of unacceptable job performance as required for removal of a federal employee by 5 USC 4303. Murphy's appeal to the MSPB thus meets the statutory definition of a grievance as an employment "complaint" concerning a "matter relating to [his] employment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reject the FLRA's attempt to read the distinctions drawn in 7121 back into the original definition of grievance provided in 7103(a)(9)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our interpretation of the term "grievance" may differ from that of the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Fresno Service Center v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 706 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983). There the court of Appeals held that 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(A) does not guarantee a union the right to representation at an Equal Employment Opportunity precomplaint conciliation conference. The Ninth Circuit's decision appears to us to be based primarily on its conclusion that the precomplaint conference did not constitute a "formal" discussion....&#8197;To the extent, however, that the Ninth Circuit may have construed the term "grievance" to include only disputes governed by a negotiated procedure, we must disagree with its interpretation for the reasons already discussed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Section 7121 recognizes that employee complaints challenging alleged discrimination or a permanent or temporary removal for allegedly unacceptable performance will often be covered by a collective bargaining agreement as well as by statutory procedures. Double coverage is to be expected: resolution of such episodes can potentially affect all bargaining unit employees in important ways. Decisions about what constitutes an unjust dismissal or an unacceptable basis for preferring or rejecting a single employee spills over to the rights and expectations of all unit employees. Remedies for improper employer conduct, such as reinstatement or retroactive seniority, also may affect other bargaining unit employees, since a benefit or opportunity granted to one employee can mean the loss of the same benefit or opportunity for another employee. The impact of these individual complaints on the bargaining unit will be felt regardless of whether the aggrieved employee opts to pursue a negotiated grievance procedure or an alternative statutory procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, recognition of a union's interest, as the representative of the bargaining unit, in the alternative statutory procedures guaranteed in 7121(d) and (e) does not answer the question of the union's statutory role in such procedures. Under the FLMR, the union's institutional role in these statutory grievance procedures is obviously more restricted than its role in a negotiated grievance procedure. The FLMR provides that only the union may represent an employee in a negotiated grievance procedure if the employee elects not to present the grievance himself; the statute does not similarly restrict an employee's choice of a representative outside the negotiated grievance procedure....&#8197;Nonetheless, although the union's institutional role may be restricted, we do not think it necessarily is nonexistent. In the absence of congressional intent to the contrary..., the words of 7114(a)(2)(A), which provide that the exclusive representative has the right to be present at any formal discussion of a grievance between management and a bargaining unit employee, assure the union a role in the alternative procedures so long as the statutory criteria of 7114(a)(2)(A) are met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's conclusion that the interview was not formal runs counter to the undisputed evidence....&#8197;[T]he meeting was initiated by management; it was held away from Lewis' normal work area, lasted twenty to thirty minutes, and was marked by the taking of notes by a "high level" management representative. The FLRA concluded that these undisputed indicia of formality were outweighed by the fact that none of the interviewers were in Lewis' chain of supervision. The FLRA also cites as support for its conclusion that lack of a "clear" finding that Lewis' presence was mandatory and the lack of evidence on the record of any advance notice of the meeting or any formal agenda distributed in advance of the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he interview of Lewis was planned in advance. For an attorney and two labor relations specialists to meet at the office of one of the labor relations specialists and in a single day interview <span class="Italic">all</span> of the witnesses to be called at an MSPB hearing surely indicates some advance preparation....&#8197;Lack of notice and formal agenda, therefore, offer negligible evidence of informality, since the inference that these factors are sufficient to support, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the interview <span class="Italic">might</span> have been an impromptu gathering, is directly contradicted by more powerful evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Where an employee interview is characterized by strong indicators of formality, such as the fact that an employee was summoned to the meeting initiated by three management representatives and held on management's terrain, an asserted lack of clear evidence on a single disputed point such as whether the "continued" presence of the employee was compulsory cannot carry the day for the agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the FLRA does not explain why the fact that the interviewers were not in Lewis' direct chain of supervision outweighs the fact that the interviewers were nonetheless management representatives....&#8197;Prior <span id="page_1492"></span>FLRA cases have not required a showing that the agency representatives were within the employee's chain of supervision....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When an employer interviews an adverse witness rather than his own or even a neutral witness, common sense suggests that the situation carries a greater potential for intimidation or coercion. In assessing formality...the FLRA has always considered the potential coerciveness of the encounter. Factors frequently cited by the FLRA as militating toward a finding of formality, such as mandatory attendance or the number of supervisors present, focus on the confrontational potential of the interview, or at least the perception thereof....&#8197;In the present case, the FLRA disregarded its own precedent bearing on the important element of formality supplied by the fact that the Bureau interviewed an adverse witness....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Telephone Interviews Were Formal Discussions under Section 7114(a)(2)(A).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the Judge, we find that the telephone interviews conducted by the Respondent's attorney were formal discussions under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Authority has repeatedly held that interviews by agency representatives with bargaining unit employees in preparation for third-party proceedings in which the union has an adversary role are formal discussions....&#8197;In so holding, the Authority has followed the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In that case the court found that an interview with bargaining unit employees, conducted by the agency in preparation for an MSPB hearing, constituted a formal discussion concerning a grievance under section 7114(a)(2)(A). Further, in <span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>, we found that such interviews are not removed from the scope of section 7114(a)(2)(A) simply because the interview is conducted over the telephone instead of in person. 35 FLRA at 605.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that nothing in the record or in the arguments presented in the Respondent's exceptions compels a different result in this case. As the Judge correctly noted, in order to find that a union has a right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, it must be shown that the following elements exist: (1) there must be a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C. and VA Medical Center, Brockton Division, Brockton, Massachusetts</span>, 37 FLRA 747, 753 (1990). There is no dispute that the interviews constituted discussions between at least one representative of the Respondent and one or more bargaining unit employees. Further, and contrary to the Respondent's contention in its exceptions, there is no question but that the discussions concerned a "grievance." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution</span>, 29 FLRA 584, 589-90 (1987) <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (the term "grievance" in section 7114(a)(2)(A) should be interpreted broadly and can encompass statutory appeals, including appeals to the MSPB)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the formality of the meeting, the Judge properly found that the discussions satisfied a number of the indicia of formality deemed relevant by the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Bureau of Field Operations, San Francisco, California</span>, 10 FLRA 115, 118 (1982). The Judge specifically credited testimony indicating that employee Smith was informed in advance by her second-level supervisor that the interview with Geffner, one of the Respondent's attorneys, would take place and that Smith's presence was mandatory. Respondent's suggestions that the employees could have requested to take the calls at their desks or to postpone the conversations is unsupported in the record. Moreover, even if the employees could have postponed the precise time of the interviews, it is beyond doubt that the discussions were not spontaneous, but were planned in advance by the Respondent. Further, a discussion can be formal in the absence of a specific preestablished agenda. <span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>, 35 FLRA at 604. Clearly, in this case the interviews were held to discuss a particular topic, the pending appeal of Gary Dekoekkoek. While the Respondent is correct in noting that the record does not indicate whether the Respondent's attorney took notes, the lack of evidence on that point does not affect the validity of the conclusion that the totality of the circumstances indicates that the discussions were formal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Finally, as we noted in <span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>, the mere fact that discussions take place by telephone does not remove them from the scope of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, if, as here, the discussions otherwise meet the tests for formality....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union's Presence at the Interviews Would Not Violate the Attorney Work Product Privilege or the Attorney-Client Privilege.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority addressed the question of whether the attorney work product privilege was affected by union presence during a management attorney's interview of unit employees in preparation for a third-party proceeding in <span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>. There the Authority rejected a claim that such presence would effectively destroy management's right to prepare its defense. <span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>, 35 FLRA at 608. The Authority found that allowing union representation did not preclude management representatives from interviewing bargaining unit employees in preparation for hearings, or creating documents for the agency's use which reflect the attorney's thoughts or impressions resulting from the interview. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 607-08.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same reasoning applies to the instant case.&#x2003;In determining only that the Union had a right to be present during telephone interviews that constitute formal discussions under the Statute, we have not required that the Respondent's attorney disclose anything about her thoughts, impressions, legal theories or litigation strategy. Moreover, we have not precluded the attorney from fully investigating her case through other means. Accordingly, as we did in <span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>, we reject the Respondent's claim that union presence violates the attorney work-product privilege. For the same reasons, we do not view <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span> as applying to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we do not find that either the FOIA or the Privacy Act is applicable to prehearing investigations, as the Respondent contends. FOIA exemption (b)(5), cited by the Respondent, permits an agency to protect from disclosure "inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(5). The prehearing investigations at issue in this case involve no such written material. Similarly, the Privacy Act restricts the disclosure of records "contained in a system of records...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b). As this case does not involve the disclosure of "records" within the meaning of the Privacy Act, it does not fall within the ambit of the Privacy Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor do we find that the Union's presence at the interview would in any way violate the attorney-client privilege. Initially, we note that the attorney-client privilege is narrower in scope than the attorney work-product doctrine. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Nobles</span>, 422 U.S. 225, 238 n.11 (1975); <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span>, 329 U.S. at 508 (memoranda, statements and mental impressions in issue in that case were found not to be protected by the attorney-client privilege). Further, in order for the attorney-client privilege to be implicated in these interviews there must be an attorney-client relationship between the Respondent's attorney and the unit employee being interviewed. The Respondent does not claim that its attorney represents the employees as individuals, but, rather, it states that they were representatives of the institutional client, the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent relies on <span class="Italic">Upjohn v. United States</span> to support its claim that the attorney-client privilege is applicable to these interviews. In <span class="Italic">Upjohn v. United States</span>, the Supreme Court held that the attorney-client privilege can be invoked to protect communications between an attorney representing a corporation and employees of that corporation concerning matters within the scope of the employees' corporate duties. Significantly, the attorney in <span class="Italic">Upjohn v. United States</span> had engaged in the communications to enable him to give "sound and informed advice" to his client, the corporation. 449 U.S. at 390. In contrast, the employees in this case were not interviewed in their capacity as representatives of the Respondent, nor about actions they had taken in the course of their official duties. Further, the attorney was questioning them in order to prepare for litigation, not in order to give advice and counsel to her "client." In <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span>, the court stated with regard to the attorney-client privilege: "[T]he protective cloak of this privilege does not extend to information which an attorney secures from a witness while acting for his client in anticipation of litigation." 329 U.S. at 508. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that <span class="Italic">Upjohn v. United States</span> does not apply in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we do not find that the attorney-client privilege would be violated if the Union were allowed to attend such interviews.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Respondent Violated Section 7116(a)(1) by Requiring an Employee to Participate in the Interview</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under its <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> doctrine, the Authority requires that when management interviews employees "to ascertain necessary facts" in preparation for third-party proceedings, it must provide certain safeguards to protect employee rights under section 7102 of the Statute. <span id="page_1493"></span>9 FLRA at 933. In <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span>, the Authority articulated those safeguards as follows: (1) management must inform the employee who is to be questioned of the purpose of the questioning, assure the employee that no reprisal will take place if he or she refuses, and obtain the employee's participation on a voluntary basis; (2) the questioning must occur in a context which is not coercive in nature; and (3) the questions must not exceed the scope of the legitimate purpose of the inquiry or otherwise interfere with the employee's statutory rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, the Authority concluded that the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> assurances need not be applied on a <span class="Italic">per se</span> basis. Rather, the Authority will examine the circumstances of each case to determine whether employee participation was voluntary. 31 FLRA at 549. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 36 FLRA 748, 770 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the evidence indicates that employee Smith did not participate voluntarily in the telephone interview with Geffner. Rather, the Judge credited Smith's testimony that initially she had refused to be questioned about the Dekoekkoek case because she "...did not care to get involved" and that she eventually agreed to the interview only because her supervisor told her that she "had no choice, that [she] had to be [questioned]. In these circumstances, we conclude that management did not give the proper assurances, as required under <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span>, that Smith could refuse to participate in the interview and that there would be no reprisals taken against her if she chose not to participate. Further, the interview was conducted under circumstances that enhanced its coercive nature. Thus, the interview was conducted not by the employee's immediate supervisor but by a higher-level Agency official, an attorney from the Respondent's district office. Further, it took place in a supervisor's office, not at the employee's workplace. The fact that Smith's supervisor was not present during the interview tempers, but does not remove, the coerciveness inherent in the unfamiliar surroundings. Considering all the circumstances, we conclude that <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> was not adhered to in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent violated section 7116(a) of the Statute by failing to safeguard Smith's protected rights under Section 7102.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so holding, we reject the Judge's conclusion that <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> does not apply to situations where a union has been afforded the opportunity to be present and to represent the employee who is to be questioned. As the Respondent points out in its brief to the Authority, the Judge's finding in this regard is contrary to our decision in <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, which held that fulfilling the requirements of the obligations under section 7114(a)(2)(A) cannot substitute for the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards. 31 FLRA at 545-46. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> assurances are designed to safeguard the rights guaranteed by the Statute to employees, while unions are the beneficiaries of the representational rights accorded by section 7114(a)(2)(A). We will continue to apply this interpretation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we conclude that neither the Respondent's governing statute nor its regulation precluded it from applying the safeguards set forth in <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> to Smith in the circumstances of this case. With regard to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311, cited by the Respondent for the proposition that it had an unqualified right to interview the employees in this case, that section of the statute in fact governs the Respondent's authority to issue subpoenas and thus has no application to the matter in dispute. We do not question the Respondent's power to subpena [sic] its employees to testify in the investigation of, and hearings in, pending cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, 38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.735-21(f) is entitled "Furnishing testimony" and notifies employees that they will be subject to disciplinary action if they refuse to testify, conceal material facts or give willfully inaccurate testimony "in connection with an investigation or hearing[.]" The Authority's <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards are not designed to permit employees to refuse to testify in hearings, to conceal material facts or to testify untruthfully. Nor are they applicable to situations involving actual investigations of workplace misconduct. In this regard, we agree with the Respondent's contentions that employees have a duty to account for their performance and conduct in disciplinary investigations. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 34 FLRA 1150, 1159 (1990) (proposal establishing a blanket prohibition on the use of evidence obtained in interviews with employees excessively interferes with management's right to take disciplinary action). This case does not involve an investigation of misconduct, however. Rather, the Respondent's attorney was interviewing Smith and the other employees about a matter that had already been fully investigated and was about to be heard by the MSPB. Whatever the attorney's motives may have been in interviewing the employees--strengthening the Agency's case before the MSPB, attempting to weaken the Union's case on behalf of the grievant, or exploring the desirability of settlement--they could not at that stage of the proceedings have included investigation of a matter over which an employee had already been terminated. In these circumstances, the Authority's precedent is clear: an agency official may not engage in coercive discussions with its employees.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;As we state above, an agency always has the option of compelling an employee's testimony through subpoenas. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 41 FLRA No. 72, slip op. at 34-35 (1991). Indeed, the Authority recently held that parties may negotiate an agreement to compel the participation in discovery prior to third-party proceedings of unit employees who would be witnesses in those proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Provision 9).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Long Beach</span> was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, <span class="Italic">VAMC, Long Beach v. FLRA</span>, 16 F.3d 1526, 1531-36 (9th Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally speaking, the scope of formality within the meaning of the Statute is extremely broad. A meeting is formal unless it is a "casual conversation or a conversation that followed from an impromptu meeting." <span class="Italic">McClellan</span> [35 FLRA 594 (1990)] at *9. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2241</span>, 3 F.3d at 1389 (a meeting is formal unless it is a "spontaneous or chance meeting[&#8197;] in the workplace"); <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 774 F.2d at 1190 (to escape formality, a meeting must be an "impromptu gathering"). Within that broad compass, whether a discussion is "formal" depends on the totality of the circumstances. The FLRA has commonly looked to a number of specific factors to determine formality, such as the level in the management hierarchy of the person who called the discussion; whether other management representatives attended the discussion; where the discussion took place; how long it lasted; how the employee was summoned to it; whether there was a formal agenda; whether the employee was required to attend; and whether the employee's name and comments were transcribed. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Chicago, Ill. v. Am. Federation of Gov't Employees, Local 648</span>, 32 FLRA 69, 1988 WL 212939 (FLRA) at * 4-5 (1988) (<span class="Italic">"Chicago"</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hospital contends that the interviews at issue here were not formal because they were conducted by telephone, because there was no advance announcement or scheduling, and because the employees were left alone in their supervisors' offices while they talked to the Hospital's counsel. The FLRA disagreed, and we affirm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note at the outset that these interviews were not impromptu or spontaneous gatherings.&#x2003;Rather, they were planned question-and-answer sessions that the employees were required to attend. Therefore, they fall within the broad meaning of "formality" for the purpose of the Statute. Our inquiry into their formality could end here. However, because the FLRA considers formality under a totality test, we will review the importance of the factors on which the Hospital relies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA considered in <span class="Italic">McClellan</span> whether the fact that an interview is conducted over the telephone removes it from the scope of the Statute. It concluded that it does not. <span class="Italic">McClellan</span> at *9. To construe the Statute to exclude telephonic questioning, no matter what other indicia of formality the discussion may have, would be to give the Statute a reading at odds with its plain language, the FLRA's decisions, and our obligation to affirm those decisions unless they are arbitrary and capricious. An interview "involves questioning to secure information; obviously, it can be done in an number of different ways by a variety of different people." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. Fed. Labor Relations Authority</span>, 835 F.2d 1446, 1450 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">"NTEU II"</span>) (discussing the term "examination"). Indeed, the fact that an interview is conducted over the telephone may even increase its formal nature. An interviewer's facial expressions are not visible over telephone, and any silences during questioning are more obvious during a telephonic interview, where the entire focus is on sound, than they might be face-to-face.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The indicia of formality in this case were strong.&#x2003;The interviews were conducted in a supervisor's or second-level supervisor's office, an area removed from the employee's normal work environment. The staff attorney represented a high level of management. The interviews lasted between five minutes and more than an hour. They were planned in advance and concerned only one topic, Dekoekkoek's upcoming Board hearing. Under these circumstances, we do not find arbitrary and capricious the FLRA's determination that the interviews were formal. The lack of advance notice to the employees, and the fact that the employees were left alone in their supervisors' offices while they were interviewed, in no way serve to overcome either the deference we owe to the FLRA's determination on this point, or the indicia of formality present in this case. Those indicia strongly rebut any inference of spontaneity that might be raised by the lack of notice and the absence of the supervisors. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span> 1, 774 F.2d at 1190.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the alternative, the Hospital, relying on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Svc. Ctr. v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983), argues that we should ignore the FLRA's indicia of formality and look instead to what it calls the "informal purpose" of the interviews....&#8197;Even according to the Hospital's account, the staff attorney "was attempting to gather information as to what potential non-party fact witnesses would say at a [Board] hearing." Preparation for a Board hearing is not an informal goal, and assessing the testimony of potentially adverse witnesses is not an informal undertaking....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Hospital contends that no "discussions" took place. It argues that, under the Statute, "discussion" must be "reasonably understood [to mean]...negotiation, 'give-and-take,'...[an] attempt to <span id="page_1494"></span>reconcile a complaint or to otherwise change the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>." It contends that, because the interviews here were intended merely to gather facts, they were not discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, however, "meeting" and "discussion" are synonymous....&#8197;Such an interpretation comports with the statutory goal of vindicating a union's independent right to be present so that it may safeguard the interests of all union employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Grievance</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute defines "grievance" extremely broadly. It provides that a grievance is "any complaint--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;by any labor organization concerning any matter relating to the employment of any employee; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(C)&#x2003;by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;the effect or interpretation, or a claim of breach, of a collective bargaining agreement; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment[."]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9). In conformance with the language of the Statute, the FLRA reads "grievance" broadly, as encompassing statutory appeals, including appeals to the Board....&#8197;<span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU 1</span>, 774 F.2d at 1188 (referring to "the all-inclusive definition of 'grievance' in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) and &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)") (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 40 (1978)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hospital contends that the interviews at issue here did not concern a "grievance" because they pertained to a Board hearing rather than to a procedure within the contractual grievance process. Relying on <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno</span>, it argues that, like the EEOC procedure at issue in that case, the Board hearing here "did not involve any aspect of the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">." IRS Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1025.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">IRS Fresno</span>, however, concerned a charge filed under Title VII, a Congressional enactment unconnected to the Statute. The EEOC regulation in <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno </span>established a procedure for handling such charges unconnected to those established by the Statute. In fact, the collective bargaining agreement in <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno </span>explicitly excluded from the grievance procedure claims covered by the EEOC. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1024-25. Here, by contrast, we consider a statute that Congress enacted to implement its finding that "labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a). Here, there is no suggestion that the Union's collective bargaining agreement excludes grievances of the type filed by Dekoekkoek, or proceedings such as those established by the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Board hearing in this case <span class="Italic">did</span> "involve [an] aspect of the collective bargaining agreement." Dekoekkoek initially brought his grievance pursuant to the procedures established in the collective bargaining agreement. Under the Statute, he was permitted to appeal his removal either under that agreement or to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). He chose to appeal to the Board. Thus, unlike <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno</span>, this case concerns a dispute intimately connected with the Union's collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of the Statute is plain: a grievance is "<span class="Italic">any</span> complaint by any employee concerning <span class="Italic">any</span> matter relating to the employment of the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(A) (emphasis added). Certainly that applies to any matter arising under the Statute. In <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno</span>, the question was whether the protections of the Statute apply to proceedings conducted by the EEOC. We concluded that they do not, finding that an employee's rights as to EEOC proceedings are established by the EEO statute and accompanying regulations. The question here--whether the protections of the Statute apply to proceedings before the Board--is entirely different. It has been answered in the affirmative by the Tenth and District of Columbia circuits<span class="Italic">. Local 2241</span>, 3 F.3d at 1390-91; <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 774 F.2d at 1184-89. We now join them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the issue whether the FLRA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that the Hospital committed an unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute when it failed to advise Stella Smith, the employee who did not wish to be questioned, that she could refuse to be interviewed without penalty of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When management interviews employees "to ascertain necessary facts" in preparation for third-party proceedings, it must provide certain safeguards to protect the employees' rights under &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute<span class="Italic">. Brookhaven</span>, 1982 WL 23283 at *3. These safeguards are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1) management must inform the employee who is to be questioned of the purpose of the questioning, assure the employee that no reprisal will take place if he or she refuses, and obtain the employee's participation on a voluntary basis; (2) the questioning must occur in a context which is not coercive in nature; and (3) the questions must not exceed the scope of the legitimate purpose of the inquiry or otherwise interfere with the employee's statutory rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span>The FLRA does not require an employer to give the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> assurances in every case. Instead, it looks to the circumstances of each case to determine whether the employee submitted to questioning voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 1988 WL 121281 1, at * 7. In this way, it can better determine whether the circumstances in which formal discussions occur are coercive<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the FLRA examined all of the circumstances and found that the reluctant employee, Stella Smith, did not submit voluntarily to Geffner's questioning. It found that Smith initially refused to be questioned, consenting to be interviewed only after her supervisor told her that she "had no choice, that [she] had to be [questioned]." It found that other surrounding circumstances added to the coercive nature of the interview. Smith was not interviewed by her own supervisor, but by Geffner, an attorney who worked at a high level of management and who was based in the Hospital's district office. Although Smith's supervisor was not present during the interview, the FLRA ruled that this did no more than "temper[&#8197;]...the coerciveness inherent in the unfamiliar surroundings." The FLRA concluded that, under these circumstances, the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards were not met and that the Hospital therefore violated &#x00A7; 7116(a) of the Statute. The FLRA's finding is supported by the record. It is therefore neither arbitrary nor capricious, and we accordingly affirm it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hospital contends that, <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards notwithstanding, 38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.735-21(f), a Veterans Administration regulation, required Smith to submit to questioning. That regulation requires employees to</p>
<p class="noindent-2">furnish information and testify freely and honestly in cases respecting employment and disciplinary matters. Refusal to testify, concealment of material facts, or willfully inaccurate testimony in connection with an investigation or hearing may be grounds for disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.735-21(f). The FLRA determined that the regulation is not applicable here. As it pointed out, the Hospital's regulation subjects an employee to discipline for a refusal to provide information in two circumstances: in connection with an investigation, and in connection with a hearing. Discipline may be imposed if an employee refuses to testify, testifies inaccurately, or conceals material facts. We will examine the two aspects of the regulation in turn.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first aspect proscribes certain conduct in connection with disciplinary investigations.&#x2003;The Hospital suggests that because employees are required to "testify" they must provide answers to questions asked by investigators at any time during the course of an investigation. We need not consider whether that argument is correct because, as the FLRA noted, by the time Geffner asked to interview Smith the Hospital's investigation was complete. In seeking to question Smith, the Hospital was not conducting an investigation but preparing for a third-party hearing. As we explained above, we must presume that an employer investigates an employee's alleged disciplinary infractions before it fires the employee, not afterwards. Thus, we agree with the FLRA's conclusion that the investigative aspect of the regulation is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also ruled that the part of the Hospital's regulation governing employees' responsibilities with respect to hearings does not apply. Again, we agree. The effort to interview Smith did not involve an attempt to obtain her "testimony." Smith did not refuse to testify, either by way of deposition or as an actual witness; she did not testify falsely; nor did she "conceal" material facts. She merely declined to assist a lawyer in the preparation of a case. Smith was not requested to perform any act at, or as a part of, a "hearing." The employees who were questioned by Geffner were not placed under oath, cross-examined, or made subject to penalty of perjury. They were simply asked to provide information to Geffner which might assist her when she presented the hospital's case at a subsequent proceeding. Smith declined to do so. Such a refusal, as the FLRA pointed out, does not subject an employee to discipline under the regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's determination is not arbitrary or capricious. Moreover, it avoids a conflict between the Hospital's regulation and the agency's <span class="Italic">Brookhaven </span>safeguards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hospital's final contention is that the FLRA's interpretation of the regulation is incompatible with <span class="Italic">Navy Public Works Center, Pearl Harbor v. FLRA </span>678 F.2d 97, 101 (9th Cir. 1982) ("<span class="Italic">Pearl Harbor"</span>). Under <span class="Italic">Pearl Harbor</span>, it argues, an employer has a nonnegotiable right to enforce an employee's duty to account to supervisors for his or her performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, first, that, in <span class="Italic">Pearl Harbor</span>, "the issue before us [was] whether the FLRA's holding that a proposal...is procedural under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106](b)(2) is 'reasoned and supportable.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 100 (footnote omitted). That question, and therefore, <span class="Italic">Pearl Harbor's</span> holding, bears no relation to the issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Pearl</span> <span class="Italic">Harbor</span> involved the question whether an employee <span class="Italic">suspected </span>of misconduct could be compelled to cooperate in an <span id="page_1495"></span><span class="Italic">investigation</span> of that misconduct. 678 F.2d at 99 n.2. <span class="Italic">See also id. </span>at 101 (stating that the case concerns a targeted employee's "duty to account, whether generally or in <span class="Italic">disciplinary</span> <span class="Italic">investigations") </span>(emphasis added). Here, however, the issue is whether a <span class="Italic">witness </span>can be compelled to provide information at the <span class="Italic">post-investigatory</span> third-party stage, in order to help the employer prepare for a third-party hearing. <span class="Italic">Pearl Harbor's</span> discussion regarding the duties of an employee to cooperate when suspected of an improper act tells us little about the obligations of a prospective witness to cooperate, and certainly nothing about a witness's obligations after the investigation into the improper act has been completed and the government has already taken the disciplinary action it deems appropriate. Whatever the merits of <span class="Italic">Pearl Harbor</span>, therefore, it is of little assistance to us here.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC, Denver and AFGE Local 2241</span>, 44 FLRA 408 (1992), concluded that the agency committed a ULP when it failed to allow the union an opportunity to be present during management interviews of unit employees to be called by management as witnesses for an MSPB hearing involving an appellant represented by the union. On review, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2241</span> was enforced in <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 3 F.3d 1386, 1389-90 (10th Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding that VAMC committed an unfair labor practice in failing to give the Union advance notice and an opportunity to be represented when VAMC's staff attorney interviewed the employees, FLRA relied on its prior decision in <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Medical Ctr., Long Beach, Cal</span>., 41 F.L.R.A. 1370 (1991). In that Decision and Order, FLRA had held that interviewing employees by telephone in preparation for a Board hearing was a "formal discussion" concerning a "grievance" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VAMC's basic position in this court in the present case is essentially as follows: (1) Doane's interview of the six VAMC employees did not constitute a "discussion"; (2) if such did constitute a "discussion," they did not constitute a "formal" discussion; and (3) if they did constitute a "formal discussion," they did not concern a "grievance." We hold that VAMC is in error in all of its alternative positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proceeding to a consideration of the FLRA's findings and conclusions, most certainly, in our view, Doane had "discussions" with the six employees whom he interviewed in preparation for the hearing before the Board. The FLRA has consistently held that "discussion" is synonymous with "meeting." <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Texas Adjutant General's Dep't. 149th TAC Fighter Group, Kelly Air Force Base</span>, 15 F.L.R.A. 529 (1984). That interpretation does not strike us as being arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we agree with FLRA that the discussions, or interviews, were "formal." In determining whether a discussion is formal, FLRA examines the totality of the circumstances in which the discussions took place....&#8197;These particular interviews possessed strong characteristics of formality. Certainly the interviews were not spontaneous or chance meetings in the workplace. VAMC instructed the six employees to be present at the appointed time and place to be interviewed by Doane and were told to adjust their schedules if necessary. In two of the interviews, Doane had another management representative present. The interviews took place away from the employees' work sites and in the offices of management and took ten to twenty minutes. FLRA has in numerous cases ruled that interviews thus structured are formal....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since these interviews were in preparation for a hearing before the Board and not in preparation for an arbitration hearing under the grievance provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and VAMC, VAMC argues in this court that there were no formal discussions concerning a "grievance." This argument was rejected by FLRA in the present case. We agree with FLRA. The interpretation VAMC would give 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) is too narrow. The statute requires notice and an opportunity for the Union to be represented at any formal discussion concerning "any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment." This statute recognizes that the resolution of an individual employee complaint may have an impact on the rights of other unit employees. Further, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(A) states that "[f]or the purpose of this chapter 'grievance' means any complaint by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, we also note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) provides that an "aggrieved employee" who is removed from federal employment may file either a statutory appeal to the Board or a grievance under his collective bargaining agreement, but not both. Under VAMC's interpretation of "grievance," an "aggrieved employee" would by definition necessarily file a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement, and &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) would make no sense. The formal discussions here did concern a "grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent">Decisions just discussed involve MSPB appeals of unit employees represented by the union. What if the agency desires to interview unit employees when the appellant is a supervisor, that is, not in unit? There is no representational interest by the union. But there may be a formal discussion. In <span class="Italic">GSA and NFFE Local 1800</span>, 50 FLRA 401, 403-07 (1995),<span class="Italic"> </span>the union was entitled to notice of management's interviews of unit employees who were to be interviewed as to a supervisor's MSPB appeal. Although the supervisor's appeal was not a "grievance," the union was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be present at the interviews because the questioning of employees went beyond the specifics of the MSPB case and delved into general conditions of employment. The employees were not entitled to <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings, because the appeal leading to the interviews had nothing to do with employees' protected, concerted activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A meeting comes within the ambit of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute if it involves a discussion that is formal between one or more representatives of an agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">For example, U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correction Institution (Ray Brook, New York)</span>, 29 FLRA 584, 588-89 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Ray Brook), aff'd</span>, 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In examining these elements, the Authority is guided by the intent and purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A), which is to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of bargaining unit employees as viewed in the context of the union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute.[3] <span class="Italic">For example, Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 588-89.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Consideration of the intent and purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not constitute a separate element in the analytical framework. Rather, it is only a guiding principle that informs our judgments in applying the statutory criteria. To the extent that some Authority precedent sets forth that consideration as an independent element of the analytical framework, that precedent will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example, U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, Defense Depot Tracy, Tracy</span>, <span class="Italic">California</span>, 37 FLRA 952, 961-62 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the discussions did not concern a "grievance" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) because all the elements of the definition of the term "grievance" in section 7103(a)(9) are not met. <span class="Italic">Cf. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force, F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne</span>, <span class="Italic">Wyoming</span>, 31 FLRA 541, 551-52 (1988) (<span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base</span>) (to constitute a "grievance" under section 7114(a)(2)(A) all elements of the definition of that term set forth in section 7103(a)(9) must be met). In relevant part, "grievance" is defined in section 7103(a)(9) as "any complaint" by any "employee," "labor organization," or "agency...." As defined by section 7103(a)(2) of the Statute, "employee" does not include, among others, "a supervisor or a management official[.]" The record establishes, and no party contests, that Brunning was a supervisor or management official and, consequently, not an "employee" within the meaning of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of this and the absence of any claim that a "labor organization" or an "agency" had filed the appeal with MSPB on Brunning's behalf, his appeal to MSPB does not constitute a "grievance" within the meaning of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, although the discussions did not concern a grievance, we find that they did concern general conditions of employment. The record reveals that the questions posed by Ross addressed Brunning's conduct as well as conduct that occurred and the atmosphere that existed in the office. For example, according to testimony at the hearing, Ross asked whether Brunning had told jokes of a sexual nature and whether anyone in the office had told such jokes. Her inquiries about misuse of government vehicles included asking whether interviewees had misused such vehicles or knew of misuse by any other employees. Ross also sought information concerning the general environment in the office, including matters involving employee morale and social relationships. These circumstances are distinguishable from those involved in <span class="Italic">United States Government Printing Office, Public Documents Distribution</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Pueblo, Colorado</span>, 17 FLRA 927, 929 (1985), where the discussion was limited to the manner in which four specific employees in one small organizational subcomponent were reporting their productivity and was "no more than a routine monitoring function by management." Without defining the precise boundaries of what constitutes "general" conditions of employment for purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A), we find, based on Ross' questions, that her discussions with employees concerned general conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Defense Depot</span> <span class="Italic">Tracy</span> (the Authority found that a meeting came within the scope of section 7114(a)(2)(A) when it concerned a general condition of employment of all warehouse employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's claim that the discussions concerned only past conditions of employment does not support a contrary conclusion. The Respondent has cited no authority for adding a temporal requirement to the Statute's reference to "any grievance...or other general condition of employment[.]" In any event, even if we were to adopt the Respondent's interpretation of the Statute, it would not lead to a different result in this case. Brunning was in the process of appealing his removal and the possibility existed that he would be reinstated as a result of his appeal. <span id="page_1496"></span>Thus, at the time of Ross' meetings with the unit employees it could not be assumed that Brunning and the conditions that existed during his tenure involved only matters of past concern. Additionally, Ross provided uncontradicted testimony that during some of the interviews employees expressed anxiety about the possibility that co-workers who were friendly to Brunning "would take some type of retaliatory action against them or make life hard for them within the [office]." Thus, there is no basis to find that the discussions in this case were limited to past conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the meetings between Ross and employees in the Union's bargaining unit were formal discussions at which the Union was entitled to an opportunity to be represented. We conclude that the Respondent's failure to afford the Union that opportunity violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Brookhaven Safeguards</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we agree with the Judge that the Respondent did not obtain the employees' participation in the interviews on a voluntary basis, we disagree with the Judge that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) by failing to provide the safeguards set forth in <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> when it conducted the interviews that are the focus of this case. In <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span>, the Authority recognized the tension between the legitimate need of an agency to prepare its case for presentation in third-party proceedings and the right of employees under section 7102 of the Statute to form, join or assist any labor organization or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal. 9 FLRA at 933-34. In order to minimize the coercive effect of agency interrogations when section 7102 rights are involved, the Authority set forth safeguards to be followed when an agency interviews bargaining unit employees in conjunction with case preparation for third-party proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 933.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> and its progeny, the safeguards apply only where a nexus is established between an agency's interview of a bargaining unit employee in preparation for third-party proceedings and the employee's section 7102 rights. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example, F.E. Warren Air Force Base</span>, 31 FLRA at 546-49. In this case, no such nexus has been established or is otherwise apparent. In particular, there is no claim that a labor organization was involved in any way in the proceeding for which the interviews were conducted or that the proceeding otherwise concerned activity relating to any of the rights protected by section 7102. Consequently, the Respondent was not required to observe the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circumstances present in this case are distinguishable from those in cases where the Authority has concluded that interviews were subject to the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards. For example, in <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span>, bargaining unit employees were interviewed by agency representatives in preparation for: (1) a pending unfair labor practice case initiated by the union; and (2) an upcoming arbitration hearing conducted pursuant to the parties' collective bargaining agreement. 9 FLRA at 930-31. In <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati</span> <span class="Italic">Operations, Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, 22 FLRA 1037 (1986), an employee was interrogated about an affidavit provided by the employee in her capacity as a union representative in a court proceeding. In <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base</span>, a bargaining unit employee was interviewed by an agency representative in preparation for an upcoming unfair labor practice hearing. 31 FLRA at 541-42. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, New York</span>, 38 FLRA 1552, 1558-60 (1991), the Authority found that the agency had failed to satisfy <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> requirements when union officials were required to participate in an interview in preparation for a scheduled hearing in an unfair labor practice case relating to a charge filed by a union. In yet another case, the Authority found that an agency had violated the Statute by failing to apply <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards when its representative conducted a telephone interview with a bargaining unit employee in preparation for an MSPB proceeding in an appeal in which a bargaining unit employee was being represented by a union representative. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long</span> <span class="Italic">Beach, California</span>, 41 FLRA 1370, 1382-85 (1991), <span class="Italic">enf'd</span>, 16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994). In each of these cases, a nexus existed between the interviews conducted and activity protected under section 7102.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol and AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 47 FLRA 170, 183-87 (1993), required notice to a union and allowed union presence but not active involvement at the deposition called by the agency during an MSPB appeal of a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant whose case included an affirmative defense of union animus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To find that a union has a right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, it must be shown that the following elements exist: (1) there must be a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment<span class="Italic">. VA Long Beach</span>, 41 FLRA at 1379.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the Judge, we find that the depositions conducted by the Respondent in preparation for MSPB proceedings were formal discussions under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Authority has repeatedly held that interviews by agency representatives with bargaining unit employees in preparation for third-party proceedings, including MSPB proceedings, are formal discussions. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span>, 41 FLRA at 1379, and cases cited therein. In so holding, the Authority has followed the court's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span> [774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985)]. As noted by the Judge, in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span> the court found that an interview with bargaining unit employees, conducted by the agency in preparation for an MSPB hearing, constituted a formal discussion concerning a grievance under section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that nothing in the record or in the arguments presented compels a different conclusion in this case.[6] Accordingly, for the reasons stated fully by the Judge, we find that the depositions in this case were formal discussions and that, therefore, under section 7114(a)(2)(A), the Union was entitled to be given the opportunity to be represented at those discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We reject the Respondent's argument that finding that the depositions in this case are formal discussions means that an MSPB hearing or certain Federal court proceedings could also constitute formal discussions. MSPB hearings and Federal court proceedings are not conducted by agency representatives but are controlled by administrative or Federal judges, whereas the depositions in this case were conducted by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the depositions constituted formal discussions under section 7114(a)(2)(A), we must next determine whether the Union was given an opportunity to be represented at the discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of providing a union with the right to be represented under section 7114(a)(2)(A) is to give the union an opportunity to safeguard its institutional interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit....&#8197;The right to be represented at formal discussions generally means more than merely the right to be present. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, New Cumberland Army Depot, New Cumberland, Pennsylvania</span>, 38 FLRA 671, 677 (1990); and <span class="Italic">U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 21 FLRA 765, 768 (1986) (<span class="Italic">NRC</span>) (the unions' right to be represented at meetings between management and unit employees on a planned reorganization and compressed work schedules included the right of the union representatives to "comment, speak, and make statements"). However, we agree with the court that when formal discussions occur in the course of statutory appeals procedures, "the union's institutional role...is obviously more restricted than its role in a negotiated grievance procedure." <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 774 F.2d at 1188. Moreover, "[c]omments by a union representative must be governed by a rule of reasonableness, which requires that there be respect for orderly procedures...." <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 21 FLRA at 768. Therefore, in determining the extent of a union's right to have its representative participate in a formal discussion, the Authority will consider "the purpose of the meeting conducted by the agency representative(s) and all of the surrounding circumstances...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the depositions taken in preparation for MSPB proceedings were conducted by the Respondent pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(c), parties before the MSPB may use one or more of the methods of discovery provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Federal Rules). These methods are: (1) depositions upon oral examination or written questions; (2) written interrogatories; (3) production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property, for inspection and other purposes; (4) physical and mental examinations; and (5) requests for admission. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. As the depositions in this case were conducted pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(c) and as that regulation references the methods of discovery under the Federal Rules, it is appropriate to examine the requirements for depositions found in Rule 30 of the Federal Rules concerning depositions upon oral examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rule 30(a) provides that after the commencement of an action, any party may take testimony by deposition upon oral examination. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a). Rule 30(d) provides that a party or the deponent may move to terminate or limit the examination in certain circumstances. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(d). Rule 30(c) provides in part that parties may object to the manner of the taking of the deposition and to the evidence presented. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c). Accordingly, Rule 30 contemplates that only the deponent or parties to proceedings have the right to participate in depositions conducted pursuant to that rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Rules, "although not controlling in procedures before the [MSPB], provide a general guide to [MSPB] discovery practices." <span class="Italic">Roth v.

P. 37" for guidance in ruling on a motion for sanctions against a party failing to appear for a deposition). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">West v. Department of Transportation</span>, 20 MSPR 194 (1984) (where the MSPB used Rule 30 of the Federal Rules as guidance); <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 9 MSPR 195, 199 (1981) (where the MSPB reversed the presiding official's decision denying a deposition motion because that decision was "contrary to the principles of the <span id="page_1497"></span>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure"). Because the depositions in this case were conducted under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72, which references the Federal Rules, we see no reason in this case to depart from the general practice reflected in MSPB regulations and case law that parties are to use the Federal Rules as guidance and instruction when conducting depositions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(c). Accordingly, in these circumstances, we will look to the Federal Rules to determine the reasonableness of the conduct of the nonparty Union representative attending the depositions. As we noted above, Rule 30 of the Federal Rules contemplates that only the deponent or parties or their representatives have the right to participate in depositions conducted under the Federal Rules.[8] Therefore, to foster "respect for orderly procedures[,]" we find that the Union, as neither a party to the MSPB proceedings nor a party's representative, would not have been permitted under the Federal Rules to participate in the taking of the depositions or in objecting to the manner in which the depositions were conducted. <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 21 FLRA at 768 (the conduct of a union representative attending a formal discussion "must be governed by a rule of reasonableness, which requires that there be respect for orderly procedures"). However, nothing in Rule 30 or 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72 precluded the Union from being present at the depositions in this case.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Although the parties may stipulate to modify the procedures for depositions in certain circumstances, there is no evidence in this case that they agreed to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 29.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We reject the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">GPO</span> [23 FLRA 35 (1986)] to support its argument that section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not give the Union the right to be present at discussions carried out pursuant to MSPB or EEOC procedures. <span class="Italic">GPO</span> arose in the context of whether the agency bypassed the union by negotiating an informal adjustment of a unit employee's EEO complaint and did not address the union's institutional right to be represented at formal discussions under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have already noted that in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, the court held that a union's right of representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A) "is obviously more restricted" when a statutory appeals procedure is involved than when a negotiated grievance procedure is involved. <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 774 F.2d at 1188. As the instant case involves such a proceeding and concerns a formal discussion conducted pursuant to the discovery method noted above, we find that, based on these "surrounding circumstances[,]" the Union's right to representation in this case was served by providing the Union with prior notice and permitting the Union to be present at the depositions. <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 21 FLRA at 768. Accordingly, the Respondent did not violate section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute by failing to allow the Union representative to actively participate in the depositions. We note that with respect to the extent of a union's right to participate in a formal discussion, this case is distinguishable from cases such as <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span> and <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span> because those cases involved interviews conducted by agencies preparing for MSPB proceedings and there is no indication that those interviews were conducted pursuant to any of the discovery methods in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(c) or the Federal Rules. Therefore, unlike the instant case, the conduct of participants at those interviews was not affected by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(c) or the Federal Rules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that in the particular circumstances of this case, section 7114(a)(2)(A) did not require the Respondent to allow the Union representative to actively participate at the depositions. Accordingly, the Respondent complied with the requirements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute when it provided the Union with prior notice of the depositions and allowed the Union to have a representative at the depositions.</p>
