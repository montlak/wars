<h3 class="h3" id="sec11-83"><span class="space">F.</span> ORAL AND WRITTEN REPLIES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7513, an employee has the right to both a written and an oral reply to an adverse action notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an agency may take an action covered by this subchapter against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;at least 30 days' advance written notice, unless there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;be represented by an attorney or other representative; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;a written decision and the specific reasons therefor at the earliest practicable date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency may provide, by regulation, for a hearing which may be in lieu of or in addition to the opportunity to answer provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Copies of the notice of proposed action, the answer of the employee when written, a summary thereof when made orally, the notice of decision and reasons therefor, and any order effecting an action covered by this subchapter, together with any supporting material, shall be maintained by the agency and shall be furnished to the Board upon its request and to the employee affected upon the employee's request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the OPM implementing regulation, 5 CFR 752.404 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Employee's answer</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An employee may answer orally and in writing except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The agency must give the employee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the employee <span id="Page_3227"></span>is in an active duty status. The agency may require the employee to furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, within such time as would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency will designate an official to hear the employee's oral answer who has authority either to make or recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency provides for such hearing in its regulations. Under 5 U.S.C. 7513(c), the agency may, in its regulations, provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the opportunity for written and oral answer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;If the employee wishes the agency to consider any medical condition which may contribute to a conduct, performance, or leave problem, the employee must be given a reasonable time to furnish medical documentation (as defined in &#x00A7; 339.104 of this chapter) of the condition. Whenever possible, the employee will supply such documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute does not designate the level of agency official who receives the reply. The person who receives the reply and the person who makes the decision need not be the same. Agency regulations and delegations of authority determine who has the authority to propose and decide adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to constitutional due process, the requirement is for a reply opportunity; by statute, an opportunity for both a written and oral reply is provided, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-16-0386-I-1 (NP 2/28/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not specifically address whether the deciding official's refusal to extend the time for the appellant to make an oral reply violated the appellant's constitutional or statutory due process rights. We find that the deciding official's refusal did not violate those rights. The Constitution affords the appellant, as part of minimum due process, an opportunity to reply to the proposed removal either in writing or in person, but does not guarantee her a right to both an oral and written reply. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985) (finding that due process requires that, prior to deprivation of a property interest in employment, a tenured employee is entitled to "[t]he opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken") (emphasis supplied); <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 22 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 F. App'x 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Section 7513(b) provides that an employee is entitled to "a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days," to respond to a proposed disciplinary action "orally and in writing."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Cooper v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-17-0122-I-1 (NP 4/13/2023) (appellant had constitutional due process through the opportunity to submit a written reply; lack of opportunity for oral reply was not harmful procedural error under the statute).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory right correlates with the constitutional right to notice prior to deprivation by the government of a property interest, for "an appealable agency action taken without affording an appellant prior specific notice of the charge, an explanation of the agency's evidence and an opportunity to respond must be reversed because such action violates constitutional rights to minimum due process and the requirements of 5 USC 7511 and 7513 to a meaningful opportunity to respond." <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 635, 641 &#x00B6; 11 (1999); <span class="Italic">Botto v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 471, 474 (1997) ("An appellant has a statutory right to present both a written and an oral reply to a proposed action, and the Board will reverse an appealable agency action taken without affording an employee an opportunity to respond because such action violates the employee's right to minimum due process."). The employee is responsible for taking advantage of the reply opportunity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-10-0292-I-1 (NP 4/28/2011) ("Whether the appellant made a timely response does not affect whether the agency provided him with an opportunity to do so. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 635, &#x00B6; 13 (1999)."). Although <span class="Italic">Lange v. DOJ</span>, 119 MSPR 625 &#x00B6; 9, 2013 MSPB 52 (2013), suggested that the appellant has the burden of asserting unfairness in the reply process in order to show a due process violation, <span class="Italic">Ortolano v. SSA</span>, NY-0752-13-0155-I-1 (NP 2/4/2015), countered at footnote 5: "the Board <span class="Italic">may</span> raise potential due process violations <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>," citing <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 256, 261-62 &#x00B6; 10 n.3 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Both the oral and written replies may be used. Particular emphasis is placed here upon the oral reply right. The proposed action and the reply (the written reply and the summary of an oral reply), along with the decision and supporting material, become the agency administrative record that is to be made available, upon request, to the Board and to the employee. 5 CFR 752.406 (2022). Agencies may have their own regulations providing for a longer reply period than what is offered by statute. A challenge to implementation of the agency regulation is assessed through analysis of the language of the regulation and application of the harmful error standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 11, 15 (1984) (the agency reply period of 90 days was properly shortened when the agency invoked a regulatory exception concerning threats to the health and safety of personnel).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The oral reply right is significant--perhaps more so than the Board's hearing. Some practitioners urge that, given the Board's rate of affirmance of adverse actions (and the rate of affirmation of the Board by the Federal Circuit), counsel's time is well spent focusing on the oral reply and persuading the agency deciding official to desist from adverse action. The oral reply is particularly effective in a technically complex case when it follows a written reply. The written reply addresses the technicalities of the case. The oral reply addresses the equities and provides an opportunity for further discussion of the technicalities already reviewed in the written reply. Properly presented, it is a frank discussion with the employee's superior touching every aspect of the charges and the positive aspects of the employee's career. The oral reply can create an empathic and personal interest by the reply officer that can never be stimulated by a written response.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The oral reply generally takes place in the office of the deciding official, who almost certainly has read the adverse action proposal and the supporting documentation. A stenographer may be present. A personnel specialist may be there; perhaps an agency lawyer as well. The focus of the reply, however, is on the deciding official. The rest of the group is unimportant. There is no statutory or regulatory obligation that the agency obtain a transcript of the reply. <span class="Italic">Melnick v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 101 (1989). If a transcript of the reply is taken, the deciding official should be asked to provide a copy to the appellant or his representative, so that it can be checked for accuracy. The agency may summarize rather than transcribe the reply. The agency may provide a copy of the summary to appellant and counsel for correction. The summary will be provided by the agency to the MSPB should the case result in an appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Typically the deciding official starts the meeting out with a comment suggesting that everyone knows why they are present and that the appellant or his representative may proceed. In an appeal involving an alleged falsified employment application, the deciding official was quite frank with the author, who represented the employee. The deciding official said, "Tell me why I should not fire your client." There were many reasons for the client's falsification, including his desire to mask an unsavory past replete with criminal charges and alcoholism, now history due to rehabilitation, counseling, and a successful marriage. A discharge would have ruined the employee's marriage and made him unemployable. His employment record with the agency was exceptionally good, marred only by the falsified application. The author could have explained it as counsel, but the client provided a more convincing, more interesting explanation of life story. The result was that the deciding official recognized the extraordinary efforts of the employee in overcoming past difficulties and allowed the employee to remain on the rolls without adverse action. This result would not have been achieved had the oral reply been missed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The nature of the oral reply was summarized, <span class="Italic">Noe v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 86, 88-89 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee against whom adverse action is taken is entitled to the procedural protections of 5 USC 7513, which include advance written notice and an opportunity to answer. The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that these two protections constitute due process requirements. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 105 S. Ct. 1487 (1985). In the context of federal employment, it has long been recognized that an employee may raise at an oral reply any matter he believes will sway the decision. <span class="Italic">Washington v. United States</span>, 147 F.2d 284 (Ct. Cl.) <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 78 S. Ct. 6 (1957). The reply is "meant to be a meaningful protection for the employee" and to assure "significant conference...with management," <span class="Italic">Ricucci v. United States</span>, 432 F.2d 453, 454-55 (Ct. Cl. 1970), before adverse action is taken. Moreover, the fact that the employee is entitled to make a reply "implies an intent that the employee may succeed with it.... It is not to be a futile ritual." <span class="Italic">Ricucci v. United States</span>, 425 F.2d 1252, 1254 (Ct. Cl. 1970).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cafferello v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 625 F.2d 285, 288-89 (9th Cir. 1980), noted the interactive nature of the oral reply:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to removal, an employee is entitled to be heard by an agency representative, at which time the employee must be permitted to plead extenuating circumstances or make other representations in mitigation of the proposed punishment. This step is an important one because it gives the agency an opportunity to reconsider its decision in a relaxed atmosphere before its position has become unalterable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Nelso did ask Cafferello questions, but this by itself was not improper because it is the reply officer's duty to understand fully the nature and circumstances of the charges in order to take or recommend final action. Although the reply officer's tone should ideally be conciliatory rather than prosecutorial, Cafferello here was not restricted in his ability to plead his case nor otherwise deprived of his opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reply is not defective because the reply official, who was in the chain of command of the deciding official and who made an informed and meaningful recommendation, did not become extensively involved in interchange with the employee during the reply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grover v. United States,</span> 200 Ct. Cl. 337 (1973) ("There is no reason for this court to find, simply because there was limited dialogue between plaintiff and the reply officer, that his recommendation was meaningless or that the procedure itself was a mere formality acted out for <span id="Page_3228"></span>the benefit of the regulations."). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-18-115.html#sec11-115">Predisposition to Take Adverse Action; Offer to Permit Resignation"</a>; "<a href="0100-2023-18-116.html#sec11-116">Biased Proposing Official</a>"; and "<a href="0100-2023-18-118.html#sec11-118">Deciding Official Who Is Biased, Whose Decision Is Directed, Who Lacks Discretion</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the oral reply was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Swindell v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 148 (1982), quoting from a leading case, <span class="Italic">Ricucci v. United States</span>, 425 F.2d 1252, 1255-56 (Ct. Cl. 1970), 12 MSPR at 151:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Not only may he state anything he pleases, from the number of mouths he has to feed to the alleged bias of his immediate supervisor, but he may expect help in presenting his case in the form of such comments from the other side as would be natural from a person knowledgeable about the case and expecting largely to influence its resolution.... Further, he has a right to expect that the "oral reply officer" will be one whose recommendation will be meaningful, not an empty formality. This would be normally assured if he was one of the deciding officer's circle of staff and line aides and advisers whom he regularly consults in such matters, unless the deciding officer has gone outside that circle for help for the employee's own better protection. In that case, the record would show how the outsider's expertise was relied on.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dieter v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 32, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2022), commented on the fairness of a reply opportunity, measured against alleged bias of the deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant also contends that his due process rights were violated because the Director, in her role as the deciding official, was biased against him. An employee has a due process right to have an unbiased decision maker adjudicate his case. <span class="Italic">Lange v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 9 (2013). To establish a due process violation based on the identity of the deciding official, an employee must assert specific allegations indicating that the agency's choice of the deciding official made the risk of unfairness to the appellant intolerably high. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, a deciding official's awareness of background information concerning the appellant, her concurrence in the desirability to take an adverse action, or her predisposition to impose a severe penalty does not disqualify her from serving as a deciding official on due process grounds. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, a deciding official's mere knowledge of an employee's background does not rise to the level of a due process violation unless "that knowledge is a basis for the deciding official's determination on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged below that the deciding official was biased against him, as evidenced by the following: she refused to meet with him on one occasion; she refused to allow him to be on stage with her at a Memorial Day service; she banned him from entering the executive suite; she had two armed policemen present during his oral response; she placed him on authorized absence and restricted his access to the VAMC; she refused to consider his request to recuse herself as the deciding official; she was aware that he had called her "ugly" and a "hypocrite"; she was involved in the investigation leading to the agency's communication with the AMS; and she was a witness in the case. The administrative judge carefully considered these allegations but found that the appellant failed to establish that the Director, in her role as the deciding official, was actually biased against him or that the agency structured the situation in a manner that rendered the risk of unfairness intolerably high. In so finding, the administrative judge explained that the Director was at least three supervisory levels above the appellant and that her actions did not evidence bias, but rather were reasonable management practices. The administrative judge further found that the appellant's insults toward the Director were not so demeaning that the risk of her treating him unfairly as a result of his comments was intolerably high.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant restates his arguments from below on this issue but does not identify any particular error in the initial decision. Because these arguments were raised below and constitute mere disagreement with the administrative judge's well-reasoned findings and implicit credibility determinations, they provide no basis to disturb the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Davison v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 9 (2011) (finding that mere disagreement with an administrative judge's explained findings is not a basis to grant a petition for review); <span class="Italic">Crosby</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 106. Moreover, we have reviewed the record and agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant failed to show that the Director was biased against him or that the risk of bias was intolerably high. <span class="Italic">See Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1354; <span class="Italic">Lange</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Do v. DHUD</span>, <span class="blue">913 F.3d 1089</span>, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2019) ("The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to be heard." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546. As the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, due process "requires some kind of hearing prior to the discharge of an employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Pre-termination due process is important because "[e]ven where the facts are clear, the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be; in such cases, the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543"),</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Swindell, supra,</span> the Board noted that its concern was with the agency's failure to require a recommendation from the individual taking the reply, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 151:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering this expressed meaning and purpose, we think if error was committed by the agency, it was not in allocating the oral reply to the officials in the personnel office, for as <span class="Italic">Ricucci</span> expressly recognizes, they would be in the best position to advise whether the proposed dismissal would be in accord with agency personnel policy, <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1255. Rather, the error was in not requiring these officials to make an explicit recommendation in order to avoid the appearance that the oral reply was a mere formality and not a due process procedure. However, we do not, under the circumstances of this case, find this to be a harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we observe that the record shows that appellant did make a written reply and that the written reply asserted substantially the same defenses to the charges as the oral reply with the exception of the fact that appellant in his oral reply mentioned his marital problems, and his bad relations with his supervisor as mitigating factors. While we cannot know what recommendation the personnel officials would have made, we also cannot state with any certainty that whatever the recommendation, the agency would still not have decided to remove appellant. That is, there is absolutely nothing in the record before us tending to show that the outcome, the decision to remove appellant, would have been any different had the personnel officials made a specific recommendation to the deciding official....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Claims Court commented in <span class="Italic">Ricucci v. United States</span>, 432 F.2d 453, 454 (Ct. Cl. 1970), as to the level of an individual receiving a reply:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation and Manual are both cryptic as to what is to be accomplished by the "oral reply." Courts have concluded, rather by deduction than from express language, that the procedure is meant to be a meaningful protection for the employee, and that to be meaningful it has to have certain attributes.... One of these attributes concerns the choice of the "oral reply officer" in light of the prescription that he be a "superior" and have authority to recommend a decision in the premises. The authors of these requirements could not have intended the "oral reply" to be downgraded and rendered meaningless, but this would be accomplished if the designated "oral reply officer" was some uninformed and incompetent person, whose recommendation, if made at all, would be filed and forgotten. The deciding officer would comply if he heard the "oral reply" himself or designated a member of the regular circle who would advise him for or against the dismissal of the employee in the regular course of their duties. He might designate someone else in unusual situations, but the reason for doing so should either be obvious, or should be stated, or the choice should be assented to by the other side. For example, in good administration he might at times desire the "oral reply officer" to be a person of the accused employee's race or faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Washington v. United States</span>, 147 F. Supp. 284, 288 (Ct. Cl. 1957), emphasized the importance of reply rights established by the Veterans Preference Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To "answer" to charges, or claims, one need not necessarily plead the general issue, denying that he did the things which he is alleged to have done. He may plead in confession and avoidance, and that is an answer, in law, and in life. In employment relations particularly, mitigating circumstances, often of a highly personal nature, may save a job for a person who, but for these circumstances, would and should be discharged. Whether, if the plaintiff had been permitted to make this kind of a personal appeal to his superior, it would have saved his job, we do not know. But when Congress gave to the veteran the right to appear personally, it must have intended to give him the chance of succeeding in such an appeal. The naked facts, without the personal appeal, could be just as well stated in writing. And Congress knew, as we all know, that bureaucratic superiors, like other human beings, are susceptible to the effects of personal appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The procedural rights of a veteran under section 14 are clear and simple. In the present case one of those rights was denied. The plaintiff was denied his right to answer the charges against him in person at the agency level. The fact that he was subsequently given a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing at a higher level does not cure this procedural defect. Since the agency did not follow the procedure laid down by Congress plaintiff's discharge was unlawful.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. United States</span>, 284 F.2d 692, 694 (Ct. Cl. 1960) (following <span class="Italic">Washington v. United States</span>, 147 F. Supp. 284, 288 (Ct. Cl. 1957)); <span class="Italic">Noe v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 86, 88-89 (1985) (statutory right to reply includes the right to first raise an affirmative defense of disability discrimination (alcoholism) during the reply); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 599 (1986) (charge that in meeting with agency official concerning a performance rating, appellant's counsel threatened the agency with adverse publicity if resolution was not reached: "Public policy encourages settlements and would be generally disserved by allowing demands made in settlement negotiations to form a separate basis for an agency action. Such policy considerations could, of course, be overridden had the attorney engaged in truly threatening and/or criminal behavior. However, here the agency was not placed in any real or imagined <span id="Page_3229"></span>danger by the request for an unlawful reassignment in exchange for appellant not making protected disclosures. It could, as it did, deny the request. Under these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served by allowing the attorney's actions to form the basis for a separate charge of misconduct or malfeasance against the appellant. This is particularly true where, as here, there is no direct evidence of the appellant's involvement in the allegedly wrongful behavior, since he was not present at the meeting and both he and his attorney denied that the appellant had any role in the actions taken by the attorney at that meeting....").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, the Court of Claims found wanting a reply process that involved receipt of the reply by agency investigators who would then provide commentary on the reply, along with comments on mitigating circumstances, to the agency deciding official. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. United States</span>, 319 F.2d 882, 885 (Ct. Cl. 1963), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he court considers the personal appeal as one to be made to the employee's superior. We think this is a proper reading of section 14. To hold that the requirement is met by a personal appeal to the internal investigative force of the agency is to completely ignore the requirement of fair play implicit in section 14, as interpreted by this court in the <span class="Italic">Washington</span> case, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. We can think of no surer way to destroy the intended effect of the personal appeal requirement of section 14 than to allow the agency to bring in special investigators (a) to make an investigation, (b) draw up charges, (c) comment on the employee's answers to these charges, and then (d) to conduct the personal interview afforded the employee under the act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of the "meaningfulness" of the reply process is one of fact; the issue must be addressed to the Board and not raised, unless extraordinary circumstances are involved, for the first time in court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rana v. United States</span>, 812 F.2d 887 (4th Cir. 1987). If the reply is less than meaningful because the appellant's representative chose to limit the scope of the reply, the agency will not be faulted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garrett v. FAA</span>, 16 MSPR 611, 617-18 (1983). Nor need the reply session be all sweetness and light to pass statutory muster, <span class="Italic">Connor v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 721 F.2d 1054, 1057 (6th Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e are disinclined to read <span class="Italic">Ricucci</span> as requiring reversal of an agency's termination decision merely because the discharged employee is confronted with an unresponsive "oral reply" hearing officer, especially when, as here, the discharged employee was provided a full adversary hearing subsequent to his "oral reply" hearing....</p>
