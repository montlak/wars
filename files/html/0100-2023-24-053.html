<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-51"><span class="space">2.</span> Agency Handbook, Instruction</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Of agency handbooks, <span class="Italic">Seth-Morris v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 166, 171 &#x00B6; 13 (2003), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against this evidence, OPM has relied, not on regulations promulgated after notice and comment, but on its CSRS and FERS Handbook. The Supreme Court of the United States has stated that informal interpretations of a statute by an agency charged with enforcing it are "entitled to respect," "but only to the extent that those interpretations have the 'power to persuade.'" <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Harris</span> <span class="Italic">County,</span> 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 1663, 146 L. Ed.2d 621 (2000) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Pitsker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 234 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Federal Circuit has stated as follows.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency's reliance on an internal handbook as a basis for deference to an agency's interpretation of a statutory scheme is not ordinarily entitled to the same weight as its reliance on a regulation that was promulgated pursuant to statutory authority and following formal notice and comment proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Roman v. Central Intelligence Agency,</span> 297 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">citing United States v. Mead Corp.,</span> 533 U.S. 218, 230-31, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed.2d 292 (2001)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 116 MSPR 554, 556-57 n.2, 2011 MSPB 68 (2011), said of an OPM retirement handbook:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> lacks the force of law, it is entitled to deference in proportion to its "power to persuade." <span class="Italic">Eldredge v. Department of the Interior</span>, 451 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co.</span>, 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944); <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Luten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 9 n.3 (2009) (granting "some deference" to the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 386, &#x00B6; 9 (2008) (same). In this case, we find it appropriate to defer to the applicable sections of the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hicks v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-531D-19-0151-I-1 (NP 4/20/2023), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regardless of whether a provision of an agency's personnel manual or handbook was published or promulgated under the standards set out in the Administrative Procedure Act, such provision is a regulation entitled to the force and effect of law if:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1) the promulgating agency was vested with the authority to create such a regulation; (2) the promulgating agency conformed to all procedural requirements, if any, in promulgating the regulation; (3) the promulgating agency intended the provision to establish a binding rule; and (4) the provision does not contravene a statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Hamlet v. United States</span>, 63 F.3d 1097, 1105 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The "power to persuade" approach was not mentioned, but the persuasiveness of a handbook was considered as to the OPM VetGuide, interpreting VEOA requirements and entitlements, <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BRANDT_DAVID_M_SF_3443_04_0614_I_3_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248160.pdf">103 MSPR 671</a>, 678-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2006 MSPB 316 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... The <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> apparently was not issued under the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures used in promulgating regulations, and it therefore is not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations. <span class="Italic">See Christensen v. Harris County</span>, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000). Positions expressed in such issuances may, however, be entitled to some weight. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Mead Corp.</span>, 533 U.S. 218, 227-28 (2001). The amount of weight to be accorded depends in part on factors such as the consistency of the agency's position, its formality, and its persuasiveness. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statement from the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> quoted above is consistent with OPM's regulations, as we have indicated above, and we are not aware of any issuance in which OPM has taken a contrary position. Furthermore, the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> consists of a formal document, prepared for publication--and in fact published--on the internet, with the apparent expectation that it would be relied on by agencies, employees, prospective employees, and other interested members of the public. Finally, as we indicated in addressing the deference due to OPM's regulations, the position expressed here is persuasive. For these reasons, and in light of the deference to which OPM's regulatory interpretation is entitled, we defer to OPM's determination that merit promotion procedures are to be used in considering and selecting veterans under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. at 844-45.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was less inclined to defer to the OPM FERS Handbook and to OPM advisory opinions to agencies. <span class="Italic">Eldredge v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 451 F.3d 1337, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2006), decided in a challenge to a determination concerning credit for time worked toward early (firefighter) retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we are concerned with statutory interpretation, the issue is whether <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is owed to the OPM advisory opinion or the Handbook. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). We conclude that the advisory opinion does not attract <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Harris County</span>, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), "we [are] confront[ed with] an interpretation contained in an opinion letter, not one arrived at after, for example, a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 587. The Supreme Court has made clear that "[i]nterpretations such as those in opinion letters--like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law--do not warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>-style deference." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">United States v. Mead Corp.</span>, 533 U.S. 218 (2001), clarified the factors to be considered in determining whether a non-regulatory agency interpretation attracts <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. The question in <span class="Italic">Mead</span> was whether tariff classification rulings interpreting the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202 (2000), issued by the United States Customs Service, warranted <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. The Court observed that: (1) the statute did not contemplate that the rulings would have the force of law; (2) the rulings did not result from notice-and-comment rulemaking; (3) Customs did not regard a ruling as binding on anyone but the importer to whom it was issued; and (4) "46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 [classification rulings] each year." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 231-34. On the basis of these factors, taken together, the Court held that the rulings did not warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference because they were not issued in the exercise of Customs's "delegated authority... to make rules carrying the force of law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 226-27. Rather, the Court concluded that the rulings were "best treated like 'interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines[,] '... [which] are beyond the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> pale." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 234 (quoting <span class="Italic">Christensen</span>, 529 U.S. at 587).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the advisory opinion is essentially no different from the tariff rulings in <span class="Italic">Mead</span>. There is no suggestion that it resulted from an exercise of OPM's "delegated authority... to make rules carrying the force of law," or that it was binding on other parties. <span class="Italic">Mead</span> thus compels the conclusion that the advisory opinion does not warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same result obtains with respect to the Handbook under <span class="Italic">Christensen</span> and <span class="Italic">Mead</span>. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Christensen</span> expressly excluded "interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines... which lack the force of law" from <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. 529 U.S. at 587. This was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Mead</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 533 U.S. at 234. We conclude that the Handbook is not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that in <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 237 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001), we looked to the prior incarnation of the Handbook to determine whether OPM's interpretation of "involuntary separation" was "reasonable" for <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> purposes. In <span class="Italic">Nebblett</span>, OPM urged an interpretation of "involuntary separation" that excluded separations provoked by allegedly unlawful agency action. We held that OPM's interpretation was "reasonable" based in part on Handbook provisions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1358. But we do not view <span class="Italic">Nebblett</span> as having afforded <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to the Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The advisory opinion and Handbook could nevertheless attract deference under the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co.</span>, 323 U.S. 134 (1944), but only in proportion to their "power to persuade." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 140; <span class="Italic">see Mead</span>, 533 U.S. at 235; <span class="Italic">Christensen</span>, 529 U.S. at 587. We conclude that <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span> deference is not warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the advisory opinion nor the Handbook cites any authority for the proposed awareness interpretation of "involuntary separation." Section 8414(b)(1)(A) excludes from "involuntary separations" "separat[ions] ... by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency." On its face, the statute (by excluding terminations for cause) shows that the question of whether a separation was involuntary turns on the reason for the termination, not whether the employee knew of the possibility of termination at the time he took the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Handbook itself focuses on the reasons for the termination, recognizing as involuntary "any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee other than a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency[,] [for example,] ... Reduction-in-force (RIF); Abolishment of position; Lack of funds; Expiration of incumbent's <span id="Page_5231"></span>term of office"; and so forth. <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2 (1998). We and our predecessor court have previously assumed that the Handbook (or its predecessor) accurately states the general rule as to whether a separation is involuntary for purposes of the closely related provision 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d), which deals with CSRS retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appointments, temporary or permanent, may be terminated for a variety of reasons including, for example, reductions in force. The government's argument, carried to its logical conclusion, would appear to require treating as voluntary a termination due to reduction in force if the employee knew in advance that such a termination might occur. We decline to adopt such a counterintuitive reading of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Eldredge's temporary appointments were terminated before they expired, and his separations were involuntary. Therefore, Eldredge satisfies the regulatory requirements for firefighter retirement credit for his service since September 20, 1991. If the government thinks that this result is undesirable as a matter of public policy, the remedy is an amendment to the regulation, not an interpretation of the regulation and the statute to which it refers that is contrary to the plain language.</p>

Dep't of Interior</span>, 451 F.3d 1337, 1342 (Fed.

Because the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> plays no part in our decision, it is not necessary for us to address the question of deference with respect to the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> provisions considered by the AJ and the Board in this case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to interpretation by agencies of their own regulations, the Federal Circuit declared, <span class="Italic">Price v. Panetta</span>, 674 F.3d 1335, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (claim under National Security Personnel System):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless that interpretation is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation." <span class="Italic">Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997); <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945). That principle applies whether the regulation in question is ambiguous or simply silent on the issue in question. <span class="Italic">See White v. United States</span>, 543 F.3d 1330, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Moreover, an agency's interpretation of its regulations is entitled to that generous degree of deference even when that interpretation is offered in the very litigation in which the argument in favor of deference is made, as long as there is "no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question." <span class="Italic">Auer</span>, 519 U.S. at 462; <span class="Italic">Reizenstein v. Shinseki</span>, 583 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Abbott Labs. v. United States</span>, 573 F.3d 1327, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Gose v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 451 F.3d 831, 838 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("Legitimate agency interpretations may be made even during the very administrative determination that has become the subject of review. However, the interpretation must truly be one that had been applied by the agency, either prior to or, at the latest, during the exercise of its administrative powers in the present matter.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no reason to believe that the Defense Department's interpretation of its NSPS regulations is merely a "convenient litigating position" or a "<span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalization" in this case. <span class="Italic">See Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,</span> 131 S. Ct. 871, 881 (2011); <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp.</span>, 488 U.S. 204, 213 (1988). To the contrary, the record shows that the Department of Defense has treated the effective date of the bonus component of the performance-based payout in the same manner since the initiation of the NSPS program in 2004. The Departmental regulations that were in effect before they were revised in 2008 provided that "Performance-based payouts shall be effective the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1 of each year." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def. Civilian Personnel Manual,</span> DOD 1400.25-M, subch. 1930.9.4. In that form, the regulations unambiguously provided that the "first day of the first pay period" after the first of each year was the effective date for all performance-based payouts, whether in the form of salary increases or bonuses. Pursuant to the 2008 revisions to the NSPS statute, <span class="Italic">see</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 1106, 122 Stat. 3, 349, 356 (2007), the Defense Department repromulgated its regulations through notice-and-comment procedures. In the course of the revisions made to the regulations, the language of the effective date provision was amended to its current form, which continues to provide that employees must be employed on the effective date of the payout to receive a performance-based payout but defines the "effective date" only for increases in salary. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.342(g)(6) &#x0026; (7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the regulatory record, it is clear that, despite the omission of reference to the effective date for bonus payments, the new regulations were intended to codify and continue the previous practice rather than to alter it. The new regulations largely tracked the previous version, and the Department identified those areas in which changes were intended. Those specified modifications did not include any reference to altering the effective date of bonuses by separating salary increases from bonuses for purposes of determining the date of vesting. <span class="Italic">See Proposed Rules</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. 29,882, 29,890 (May 22, 2008). During the notice-and-comment process, a commenter suggested that an NSPS employee "who earns a bonus for the performance year but retires before the end of the calendar year should still be able to receive a bonus payment." <span class="Italic">Final Rule</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. 56,344, 56,372 (Sept. 26, 2008). The Department of Defense rejected that suggestion, explaining that the regulation "clearly states that an employee who is no longer covered by NSPS on the effective date of the payout is not entitled to a performance-based payout." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While that response did not specifically identify the effective date of the bonus component of the payout, it rejected the underlying rationale of Mr. Price's argument--that an employee who is covered by the NSPS during the appraisal period should be entitled to the bonus earned during that period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative record thus shows that the interpretation of the regulation advanced by the government in this case is consistent with the position taken by the Department of Defense as to the effective date issue since the Department first promulgated regulations implementing the NSPS. In short, this is a case in which "the agency's course of action indicates that the interpretation of its own regulations reflects its considered views." <span class="Italic">Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke</span>, 551 U.S. 158, 171 (2007). The Department's interpretation, which is not "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation," <span class="Italic">Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala</span>, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994), is therefore entitled to deference. Because Mr. Price has not pointed to any statutory or regulatory language that is contrary to the Department's interpretation of the regulatory rule, we agree with the district court that the Department's interpretation governs this case and requires that Mr. Price's claim be rejected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 131 Fed. Appx. 709, 712-13 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), credited an agency's interpretation of a disciplinary action guide and penalty table, even when that interpretation was provided in Board litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Phillips's first argument is that there is no evidence that the agency actually interpreted paragraph 30(a) of the guideline to reach false statements that affect the selection process but as to which a truthful answer would not necessarily result in nonselection. We disagree. It is well settled that this court gives broad deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations. <span class="Italic">See Cathedral Candle Co. v. United States Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 400 F.3d 1352, 1363-64, slip op. at 14-15 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Am. Express Co. v. United States</span>, 262 F.3d 1376, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Krizman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 77 F.3d 434, 439 (Fed. Cir. 1996). More importantly in the context of this case, the "generous degree of deference" that is due to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations applies "even when that interpretation is offered in the very litigation in which the argument in favor of deference is made." <span class="Italic">Cathedral Candle</span>, 400 F.3d at 1364, slip op. 14, <span class="Italic">citing Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 461-62 (1997). In its brief and at oral argument in this appeal, the Department of the Interior stated that it interpreted paragraph 30(a) to require removal when the falsification would have denied the agency the opportunity to investigate the applicant's mental suitability for employment as a law enforcement officer. In light of the standard applicable to agency interpretations of their own regulations, including interpretations offered "in the very litigation in which the argument in favor of deference is made," we agree with the Board that the agency's interpretation of its own penalty guidelines is entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Phillips argues that the agency's interpretation of paragraph 30(a) is inconsistent with the plain language of that provision, which she contends requires that the agency prove that the falsification in question would have led to the applicant's nonselection. We do not agree that the language of paragraph 30(a) compels that interpretation. The regulation refers to a falsification with respect to a material fact "which would have adversely affected selection for appointment." That language is susceptible to at least two plausible interpretations: that the falsification affected the actual selection decision, i.e., that a truthful answer would have resulted in the applicant's nonselection; or that the falsification affected the selection process, i.e., that the false answer deprived the agency of an opportunity to investigate a matter that was important to the selection process. We agree with the Board that the second interpretation, which the agency favors, is a reasonable interpretation of the regulatory language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasonableness of the agency's interpretation is buttressed by the fact that, if Ms. Phillips's interpretation of the regulation were correct, an applicant for a position with the agency would have little or no disincentive to make false statements on the employment application. That is because, under Ms. Phillips's interpretation, if the falsification were discovered after the applicant was hired, the applicant would not be subject to removal from the position unless the item in question was one as to which, if the applicant had told the truth, the applicant would not have gotten the position in the first place. In that setting, an applicant would have an incentive to withhold unfavorable information because, even if the information came to light, concealing the information could <span id="Page_5232"></span>not make the applicant worse off, with respect to obtaining and retaining the position, than disclosing the information. Moreover, we agree with the Board that if the agency had meant to limit paragraph 30(a) to cases in which the falsification would have led to non-selection, it seems likely that the regulation would have said so explicitly. We therefore agree with the Board that the agency's interpretation of its regulation is at least as reasonable as Ms. Phillips's interpretation. And because the regulation is subject to differing plausible interpretations, we are required to defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation. <span class="Italic">Krizman</span>, 77 F.3d at 439.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Phillips asserts, by analogy to the contract law principle of <span class="Italic">contra proferentem</span>, that any ambiguity in paragraph 30(a) should be construed against the agency because the agency wrote the guidelines. Contract law principles, however, do not apply in this case.... &#8197;Since the agency's interpretation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the guidelines, we agree that the Board correctly adopted the agency's interpretation of paragraph 30(a) in upholding Ms. Phillips removal, and we therefore affirm the Board's decision.</p>
