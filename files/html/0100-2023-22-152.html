<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-151"><span class="space">3.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Laffey</span></span> Matrix</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In civil rights litigation, a sliding fee scale based on the experience of counsel has been endorsed by the Justice Department for civil rights litigation in the D.C. Metro area. That scale, known as the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, arguably could furnish a market rate analysis for the MSPB when there is a finding of a civil rights law violation as an affirmative defense. [For the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, refer to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/page/file/1189846/download">https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/page/file/1189846/download</a>[now referred to as the <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick Matrix</span>]; check to ensure that the current version of the matrix is used.] The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate will generally be higher than an hourly rate set by an attorney in the D.C. area in his or her retainer agreement. For a practitioner of more than 35 years experience (think here of the author of one text on MSPB law), the 2021 <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate is just north of $700 an hour. The matrix was described in <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 123 MSPR 502, 512 n.6, 2016 MSPB 28 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is a schedule of hourly rates allowed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc</span>., 572 F. Supp. 354, 371, 374-75 (D.D.C. 1983), <span class="Italic">reversed in relevant part</span>, 746 F.2d 4, 24-25 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (holding that an attorney's customary billing rate, and not a matrix purporting to reflect the "true value" of the attorney's services, is the appropriate starting point for determining the reasonable hourly rate), <span class="Italic">overruled by Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516, 1524 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding that the prevailing market rate is the appropriate basis for calculating fees for private attorneys who represent individuals "at reduced rates reflecting non-economic goals"). It purports to show the prevailing market rates for attorneys in the District of Columbia and is prepared and maintained by the United States Attorney's Office for use in District of Columbia cases where a statute permits the prevailing party to recover "reasonable" attorneys' fees. <span class="Italic">Caros v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 231, &#x00B6; 9 n.5 (2015).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix approach to fee determinations, although not explicitly endorsed, was noted and not explicitly rejected in <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Kenny A</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-970.pdf">130 S. Ct. 1662</a> (2010), providing the Court's most analysis of fee enhancements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used in determining the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney's true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation. This may occur if the hourly rate is determined by a formula that takes into account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)[6] or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an enhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is compensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in cases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes. But in order to provide a calculation that is objective and reviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney's hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney's ability to a prevailing market rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Salazar v. District of Columbia,</span> 123 F. Supp.2d 8 (D.D.C. 2000); <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</span> 572 F. Supp. 354 (D.D.C. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part,</span> 746 F.2d 4 (C.A.D.C. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not firmly accepted or firmly rejected <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates, instead finding insufficient proof that a retainer rate was not a proper level of compensation in <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DC-0752-11-0884-A-1 (NP 2/10/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we find that an award of attorney fees is in the interest of justice in this appeal, we must still address the question of whether the requested fees are "reasonable." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). The appellant seeks to recover attorney fees at an hourly billable rate of $686.00, based on the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix.[5] The administrative judge found that this hourly rate was not reasonable because the fee agreement the appellant submitted indicated that his attorney, Mr. Dixon, would charge an hourly billable rate of $280.00. The administrative judge further rejected the appellant's claim that the appropriate rate of compensation is set forth in the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix, finding that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix is inapplicable because the appellant did not prevail on his discrimination and reprisal claims and, in any event, the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix has not been adopted by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix, which is prepared by the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, is intended to be used in cases in which a fee-shifting statute permits the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix--2003-2014 at n.1, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/civil.html">http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/civil.html</a>. The appellant contends that the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix found at <a href="http://www.laffeymatrix.com/">www.laffeymatrix.com</a> "is more accurate and more properly reflects increases and decreases in legal services over time."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the aforementioned evidence insufficient to overcome the presumption that the hourly rate set forth in the fee agreement is reasonable. As the agency argued, even if Ms. Alden is competent to opine as to the market rate for attorneys specializing in employment law in the Washington, D.C. area, her declaration provides no indication that she has any personal knowledge regarding Mr. Dixon's experience, the work he performed in this appeal or, more generally, the services Bynum &#x0026; Jenkins provides. As the agency also noted, Mr. Dixon's declaration does not indicate that he specializes in employment law or that his experience in the area of employment is at all comparable to Ms. Alden's. Mr. Dixon states that Bynum &#x0026; Jenkins "focus[es] on representing federal employees locally, nationally and globally," but Mr. Dixon's personal experience, although extensive, appears to be largely in the area of criminal law; he states that he participated in several clerkships with the U.S. Attorney's Office Felony Trial Division while in law school and, "[w]hile in government service...was responsible for litigating from initial presentment or arraignment to bench trial or jury trial" numerous criminal matters. Notably, Mr. Dixon indicates that Bynum &#x0026; Jenkins "also has a strong presence in the criminal law and procedure practice areas." We also note that Mr. Dixon does not indicate whether he or anyone at Bynum &#x0026; Jenkins has ever prevailed on a fee petition before the Board and, if so, the hourly rate awarded. Further, there is no information regarding the rates Bynum &#x0026; Jenkins customarily charges to private sector clients. Thus, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix represents the market rate for attorneys specializing in employment law in Washington, D.C., the appellant has not established that Mr. Dixon falls into this category.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to adjust fees upward from the retainer rate despite an argument that <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates should have controlled in <span class="Italic">Schaller v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/SCHALLER_YONG_H_PH_0752_10_0173_A_1_FINAL_ORDER_795356.pdf">PH-0752-10-0173-A-1</a> (NP 2/8/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in determining the hourly rate to be applied in calculating the attorney fee award, and she reasserts the arguments she raised below regarding the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix. Specifically, the appellant argues <span id="Page_4692"></span>that the administrative judge erroneously failed to accept evidence demonstrating the prevailing market rate and erred by limiting the fee award to the hourly rates set forth in the fee agreement. The appellant also contends that the administrative judge erred by rejecting evidence of her attorney's fees in other cases, evidence of the noneconomic goals of the law firm representing her, and evidence of her inability to pay market rates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board assesses the reasonableness of the attorney fee request by using two objective variables, the attorney's customary billing rate and the number of hours reasonably devoted to the case. <span class="Italic">Hart v. Department of Transportation</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 10 &#x00B6; 14 (2010). To establish the appropriate hourly rate, an attorney fee petition must contain a copy of the fee agreement, if any, as well as evidence of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work. <span class="Italic">Id.; Stewart v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 17 (2000), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Shelton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 177, &#x00B6; 10 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant submitted a copy of the fee agreement, she argues that the fees she agreed to pay should not apply because the rates do not reflect market rate. The appellant contends that instead she should be awarded the higher hourly rates provided in the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix. However, the Board has consistently held that, where it is agreed that a specific fee will be paid to attorneys for legal services rendered on behalf of an appellant in a Board case, the Board presumes that the amount agreed upon represents the maximum reasonable fee that may be awarded. <span class="Italic">Martinez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 152, &#x00B6; 18 (2001); <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13 (2000); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 445, 455 (1980), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Koch v. Department of Commerce</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 219 (1984). Further, our reviewing court stated in <span class="Italic">Willis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 245 F.3d 1333, 1340 (2001), that "[a] representation contract specifying hourly rates is evidence that the contract rates are consistent with local market rates, because the client freely agreed to pay the rates by entering into the contract." This presumption, however, is rebuttable by convincing evidence that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations and that the attorney's rate for similar work was customarily higher, or by a showing that she had agreed to such a rate only because of the employee's reduced ability to pay and that her customary fee for similar work was significantly higher. <span class="Italic">Gensburg</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13. In this instance, the administrative judge correctly found that neither exception applies. As the administrative judge found, all clients of the law firm representing the appellant, Alden Law Group, PLLC, are charged the same or similar rates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge erred in relying upon <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 523 (1991), in which the Board declined to award prevailing community rates to an attorney who charged rates that were less than the prevailing community rates. She contends that <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is no longer good precedent and that the Board should instead rely on <span class="Italic">Raney v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 222 F.3d 927, 935 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The appellant's reliance upon <span class="Italic">Raney</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Raney</span>, the appellant was ordered reinstated by an arbitrator. His attorneys, who were salaried attorneys of the union, had requested attorney fees and stated that any fees received would be deposited into a separate union legal representation fund. <span class="Italic">Raney</span>, 222 F.3d at 929. Based on ethical concerns identified in earlier court decisions, the arbitrator declined to award market-rate attorney fees and instead issued an award based on the cost of providing legal services. Thus, the question arose as to whether litigants who employ union staff counsel are barred from recovering market rate fees when such fees are deposited into a separate fund controlled exclusively by lawyers and the fund is used solely to support litigation on behalf of employees. The court held that, when a legal fund is separated from other union funds and is controlled exclusively by attorneys for the sole benefit of employee litigation, the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b), permits the award of attorney fees at market-fee rates for work by union staff counsel. <span class="Italic">Raney</span>, 222 F.3d at 931-37.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant is represented by a private law firm rather than union staff counsel, there are no legal fund concerns, and there is a signed fee agreement between the appellant and the law firm setting forth the rates. Thus, <span class="Italic">Raney</span> is not controlling, and the holding in that case does not affect the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly declined to grant the appellant's request to approve hourly rates based on the significantly higher rates in the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, because the appellant is not the prevailing party with respect to the petition for review, she is therefore not entitled to an additional award of fees for services rendered in connection with the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Blackman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 382, 387 (1995); <span class="Italic">Koerner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 150, 152-54 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to award a <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate for counsel with many years of experience in practice of law in areas other than Board jurisprudence and at an hourly rate higher than the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate, but who was described as semi-retired, <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 123 MSPR 502, 512-13 &#x00B6; 18, 2016 MSPB 28 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Establishing a reasonable hourly rate for Mr. Burka in the customary way--by showing the hourly rate at which he actually billed other clients for similar work during the period at issue--is not feasible, both because he was semi-retired at the time in question and because, as he conceded, this is the first time he ever practiced before the Board. As noted above, though, Mr. Burka has billed clients at the rate of $850 per hour, and he has extensive experience in complex legal matters. However, because Mr. Burka previously has never litigated a Board appeal, we find it is not appropriate to apply the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate of $495 per hour as a reasonable one. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 399, 402 (1987) (determining that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix was inapplicable under the circumstances and that, instead, use of the lodestar in computing the amount of a reasonable attorney fee award was proper). We believe that, under the unique circumstances of this case, $350 per hour, the rate charged by one of the appellant's other experienced legal counsel, the DiMuro-Ginsburg law firm (also practicing in the Washington, D.C. area), is the reasonable hourly rate. <span class="Italic">See Caros v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 231, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15 (2015) (finding that, notwithstanding the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, the appellant's attorney was entitled to fees at a reasonable hourly rate of $250, not the requested $510, for legal work performed in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area); <span class="Italic">see also Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn</span>, 559 U.S. 542, 543-44 (2010) (explaining the relevant factors to take into account when making a lodestar calculation; the superior performance of an attorney is considered only in "rare" and "exceptional" circumstances).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But when a fee agreement set an hourly rate that the client was required to pay, and a higher rate approximating a <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate if the client prevailed, the Board approved payment of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate, noting the complexity of Board law and implying the need to properly compensate the lawyers who make this work their specialty. <span class="Italic">Tanner v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-12-0209-A-1 (NP 8/1/2014), discussed valuation of services under a structured retainer agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish entitlement to an award of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), an appellant must show that: (1) he was the prevailing party; (2) he incurred attorney fees pursuant to an existing attorney-client relationship; (3) an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the amount of fees claimed is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Hart v. Department of Transportation</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 13 (2010). The dispute in this case is solely about the reasonableness of the fees claimed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's regulations, a motion for attorney fees must be supported, at a minimum, by the following evidence: (1) accurate and current time records; (2) a copy of the terms of any fee agreement; (3) a statement of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work, with evidence that the rate is consistent with the prevailing community rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney ordinarily practices, and (4) an established attorney-client relationship. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a). The agency argues that the attorney fee motion does not meet criteria (1) or (3) and should therefore be denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the time records, the agency argues that the appellant admitted that they were "redacted," yet failed to specify what information was redacted. The agency surmised below that the redacted information pertained to the billing rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of requiring accurate and current time records is to allow the Board to determine how much time attorneys and support staff spent working on the case and how that time should figure into the Board's calculation of the lodestar figure and any adjustments to that figure. <span class="Italic">See generally Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 10 (2011) (the Board calculates reasonable attorney fees by reaching a "lodestar" figure (hours reasonably spent on litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate), and then adjusting that figure upward or downward based on appropriate considerations, including the results obtained) (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983)). We find that the time records in this case are sufficient for the purposes for which the Board requires them: they reflect the individual who performed the work on the case, the dates that he performed the work, the specific items upon which he performed the work, and the amount of time he spent on each day on that work. Because the time records are sufficient as the appellant presented them, it appears that whatever redactions he made are immaterial. To the extent that they do not reflect the actual billing rate, this does not render the time records deficient because the purpose of the time record requirement is to inform the Board of how much time the attorney or law firm spent working on specific tasks. It is not meant to establish the billing rate. That portion of the lodestar calculation is met by the requirements to submit any fee agreement, a statement of the attorney's customary billing rate, and the prevailing rate for attorneys in the area.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(2)-(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Comparing the redacted time records with the unredacted ones, it appears that the information redacted was the billing rate multiplied by the hours worked. We agree with the agency that the appellant probably did this because his attorney was billing him at <span id="Page_4693"></span>$300 per hour rather than $495 or $505 per hour, and he did not want this information to appear on the time records. However, we do not think that the appellant is trying to hide anything from the Board because the $300 per hour billing arrangement that he had with his attorney is clearly reflected in the retainer agreement. It appears that the redactions were meant to avoid the confusion that might arise if the appellant submitted calculations of attorney fees at a rate other than those under which he is actually requesting fees. The Board presumes that the attorneys who practice before it do so with honesty and integrity; these attorneys are bound by ethical rules and can face serious consequences for breaking them. <span class="Italic">See in re Snyder</span>, 472 U.S. 634, 645 n.6 (1985); District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3 (candor to a tribunal); D.C. Bar R. XI (disciplinary proceedings).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the attorney's customary billing rate, the agency argues that the appellant failed to satisfy this requirement because he gave only a range of billing rates, "up to the current <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate of $505 an hour," rather than a precise figure.[3] We disagree. Although the attorney fee motion is not a model of clarity on this point, we gather from it that the appellant's attorney charges a range of fees for Board cases, but that his "typical rate" is the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate for attorneys with 20 or more years of experience. We find that this statement of the attorney's customary billing rate is sufficient under the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is a schedule of hourly rates allowed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in <span class="Italic">Laffey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we find that the evidence supporting the appellant's motion for attorney fees is sufficient to meet the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Even if we found that the evidence that the appellant submitted was lacking, we would not deny attorney fees at this stage of the proceedings for failure to meet the Board's regulatory criteria. Because the administrative judge did not notify the appellant of any perceived deficiency in his motion, we would remand this case to afford the appellant an opportunity to correct any deficiencies. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 834 F.2d 1011, 2012 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant is entitled to attorney fees at the $495 and $505 per hour rates reflected in his retainer agreement.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that it is inappropriate for the Board to award fees at $495 and $505 per hour because the appellant agreed to pay his attorney at a rate of $300 per hour, and there is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the lesser rate should apply. The appellant disputes the agency's interpretation of the agreement, arguing that the applicable rate is at the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, and that the $300 per hour rate would apply only if the appellant lost his case. We have reviewed the retainer agreement, and we agree with the appellant's interpretation of it. The agreement provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I [the appellant] understand that I will be charged the following hourly rates for purposes of this matter: John J. Rigby--$495.00 an hour, with yearly increases consistent with the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix...Attorney will attempt to have the employer pay all of his legal fees as part of any settlement and, if Client prevails...have the [Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)] ...order the employer to pay all of the Attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I agree to pay Attorney $300.00 an hour for his time during this matter, as the charges are billed. I agree that I am responsible for $300.00 an hour and expenses incurred in this matter, even if there is no recovery in this matter from the employer and even if the MSPB...does not award reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I understand that Attorney will seek to have the MSPB...order the payment of his attorney's fees by the employer at the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate of at least $495.00 an hour....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I understand that, if I prevail before the MSPB...or agree upon a settlement, I will pay Attorney's full legal fees from any recovery that I receive from my claims against the employer whether it be through settlement, litigation, mediation or otherwise.... I understand that Attorney will receive full legal fees from this matter only if I receive recovery for my claims....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I agree to pay any costs or expenses incurred by Attorney during this matter and agree to pay the $300.00 an hour in attorney fees discussed above within thirty (30) days of receiving a statement listing such $300.00 an hour charges, costs, or expenses.... I agree to pay any costs or expenses and the $300.00 per hour portion of Attorney's fees whether or not I receive any recovery from my claims against the employer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We interpret the retainer agreement as a whole. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 202(2) (1981) (a writing is interpreted as a whole). The first paragraph quoted above provides that the appellant will be charged at the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate. The second and fifth paragraphs provide that, during the course of the attorney's representation, the appellant will pay him for his time at a $300 per hour rate as billed periodically. The fourth paragraph provides that the appellant will pay "full legal fees" if, and only if, he obtains recovery. We interpret "full legal fees" to refer to the higher <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate fees discussed in the first paragraph. This interpretation is supported by the language in the fifth paragraph describing $300 per hour as a "portion" of the attorney fees. The second and fifth paragraphs provide that the appellant will nevertheless pay $300 per hour in attorney fees even if he does not prevail. The first and third paragraphs provide that the attorney will seek a fee award from the Board. Thus, under the retainer agreement, there are two separate billing rates contingent on the outcome of the case: the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate if the appellant prevails and a $300 per hour rate if he does not. The appellant was supposed to have been paying his attorney $300 per hour periodically as work on the appeal progressed. Whether the appellant would be responsible for the remaining portion of the attorney fees would only be known once the appeal was resolved. The appeal is now resolved and it is undisputed that the appellant is the prevailing party. Therefore, under the terms of the retainer agreement, the appellant is responsible for paying his attorney at the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;For these reasons, we disagree with the administrative judge that the appellant was only responsible for paying attorney fees at $300 per hour. Thus, there is no need for the Board to determine whether any "reduced rate" was based on market considerations. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13 (2000); <span class="Italic">Ishikawa v. Department of Labor</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 258, 260 (1985). To the extent that the agency's arguments on review are tailored to address that issue, we find that they are immaterial to the outcome. We acknowledge the language in the retainer agreement stating that the $300 per hour rate is a "special reduced rate" applied "because of Attorney's public interest and public spirit motives." To the extent that the attorney included this language to support an argument under the <span class="Italic">Ishikawa</span> line of cases for an award at a rate higher than the one billed, it was a red herring that appears to have led the administrative judge to insert an unnecessary layer of analysis. The appellant is merely seeking fees at the rate to which he agreed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An attorney's billing rate in a case is strong evidence of the local market rate because the client freely agreed to pay that rate. <span class="Italic">Willis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 245 F.3d 1333, 1340 (2001). Where it is agreed that a specific fee be paid to attorneys for legal services rendered on behalf of an appellant in a Board case, the Board presumes that the amount agreed upon represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded. <span class="Italic">Martinez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 152, &#x00B6; 18 (2001); <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13 (2000); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v.

Nevertheless, this presumption is rebuttable by convincing evidence, and so the appellant must still establish that his requested fees reflect the prevailing community rate. <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 152, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As evidence of the prevailing community rate, the appellant submitted declarations from four other attorneys, each stating that the $495 and $505 per hour rates were reasonable for the appellant's attorney, considering his ability, experience, reputation, and the fees charged by other attorneys in the region for similar matters. He submitted three additional declarations that Washington, D.C. area attorneys filed in unrelated federal court cases, giving a range of attorney billing rates from $184 to $695 per hour, depending on various factors, including the experience of the attorney, the firm, and the status of the attorney within the firm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 87-118. Although these declarations vary in their degrees of persuasiveness, we find that they are consistent in that the $495 to $505 per hour rate falls within what one would expect for a highly experienced employment law attorney in the Washington, D.C. area. Furthermore, we have done our own survey of recent attorney fee addendum initial decisions from the Washington Regional Office, and we find that the fee awards in these cases are consistent with the rates at which the appellant is claiming. <span class="Italic">Nazaroff v. Department of Defense</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-11-0959-A-1, Initial Decision at 4 (May 9, 2014) ($460-$490 per hour); <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Department of Commerce</span>, MSPB Docket No. CB-7121-10-0016-A-1, Initial Decision at 5-6 (Feb. 28, 2014) (<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate); <span class="Italic">Clay <span id="Page_4694"></span>v. Corporation for National and Community Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-13-0414-A-1, Initial Decision at 5 (Feb. 5, 2014) ($180 and $490 per hour); <span class="Italic">Shrewsberry v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-3443-12-0288-A-1, Initial Decision at 8-9 (Feb. 5, 2014) ($295-$395 per hour); <span class="Italic">Schmitt v. Department of Energy</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-12-0787-A-1, Initial Decision at 7-9 (Dec. 6, 2013) ($400 per hour); <span class="Italic">Sample v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-844E-12-0351-A-1, Addendum Initial Decision at 7 (Jan. 30, 2013) ($205 and $480 per hour).[6] Although the appellant's claimed rates of $495 and $505 per hour are on the high end of what an employment law attorney in this area could expect to bill, they are certainly not beyond reason, and the appellant has adequately established that his attorney is sufficiently skilled and experienced to command a rate near the top of the range.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agency points out that initial decisions by administrative judges are not precedential. <span class="Italic">See Roche v. Department of Transportation</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6; 13 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 596 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Although we do not consider ourselves bound by these addendum initial decisions, we find it helpful to consider them in order to get a fuller picture of the typical rates charged in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency argues that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix does not constitute evidence of the prevailing rate for attorneys practicing before the Board in Washington, D.C. Rather, it applies to "complex federal litigation," and should not be extended to less demanding areas such as Board law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19. In support of its argument, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Kling v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 464 (1980) for the proposition that "[m]ost of the cases appealed to the Board are neither as lengthy or as complex as the typical federal litigation involving fee awards." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this observation that the Board made more than 30 years ago dicta, and has little bearing on the realities facing counsel who practice before it today. We acknowledge that Board appeals seldom involve multiplicity of parties, complex motions practice, competing claims, or reams of discovery. This might mean that a Board appeal can be litigated in fewer hours than some other types of cases or can be handled by a small firm or solo practitioner who would not have sufficient resources to pursue, for example, a major antitrust suit. However, this does not mean that Board practice lacks complexity. Nor does it mean that the work that private counsel performs in Board litigation is undemanding and not worthy of top compensation. To the contrary, modern Board law, with its complex body of precedent and many areas of jurisdiction, presents enormously difficult legal and factual issues in a niche area that few attorneys are well-equipped to handle. Private attorneys who practice before the Board have every right to receive compensation at a reasonable market rate. The appellant has established that the rate of that compensation in this case is the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rates of $495 and $505 per hour.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We do not mean to imply that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is in any way binding on the Board. It is, at most, one factor for the Board to consider in determining the reasonableness of an hourly rate. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. District of Columbia</span>, 57 F.3d 1101, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Its relevance in this case stems largely from the evidence discussed above, which shows that other Board practitioners in the Washington, D.C. area are charging similar rates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But when the client who agrees to pay a set hourly rate is not obliged to pay the higher <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate come settlement or victory, the lower rate controls, <span class="Italic">Caros v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 231, 235-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-15, 2015 MSPB 16 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the appellant must show that the attorney fees claimed are reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 10. Where it is agreed that a specific fee be paid to an attorney for legal services rendered on behalf of an appellant in a Board case, the Board presumes that the amount agreed upon represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded. <span class="Italic">Krape</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 12. This presumption is rebuttable by convincing evidence that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations and that the attorney's rate for similar work was customarily higher, or by showing that she had agreed to such a rate only because of the employee's reduced ability to pay and that her customary fee for similar work was significantly higher. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fee agreement between the appellant and his attorney lists two options for structuring legal fees--an hourly rate or a flat fee.[4] Next to the hourly rate option, "N/A" is inserted, and next to the flat fee option, the appellant's name is inserted. Therefore, it is evident that the appellant and his attorney agreed to the flat fee option for payment. Nevertheless, both options are relevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The retainer agreement is available in both the initial request for attorney fees, which was dismissed as premature, and the second request, which is currently before us. The copy contained in the second request is distorted where it discusses requesting the agency to pay fees at the current <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate. Therefore, we cite to the copy contained in the first request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The hourly rate option, which was not selected, included a minimum retainer fee of $3,500, and an hourly billing rate of $250. It would have required the appellant to seek lodestar fees from the agency if he prevailed, without any mention of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix.[5] The lodestar is the scheme for determining a reasonable fee award in a case where, as here, the prevailing party did not obtain all requested relief, and is calculated by multiplying the hours reasonably spent on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate. <span class="Italic">Guy v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6; 8 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckert</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)). The flat fee option, which was selected, included a retainer fee of $3,000 and another $3,000 in other fees, with no hourly billing. Yet, it also differed from the hourly rate option by stating that, if the appellant prevailed, he was to seek <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> fees from the agency. Both fee structures included a provision claiming that the rates were reduced because of the attorney's "commitment to civil rights." However, neither gave any indication that the appellant was responsible for paying <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates, so long as the attorney-client relationship remained intact. In fact, under the applicable flat fee structure, the appellant was not responsible for paying anything out of his pocket beyond $6,000 under any scenario, absent a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.[6] For example, had the Board found in favor of the appellant, but nonetheless found an award of attorney fees not to be in the interest of justice, the retainer agreement did not require that the appellant pay the attorney anything beyond the previously paid $6,000.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is a schedule of hourly rates allowed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc</span>., 572 F. Supp. 354, 371, 374-75 (D.D.C. 1983), <span class="Italic">reversed in relevant part</span>, 746 F.2d 4, 24-25 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (holding that an attorney's customary billing rate, and not a matrix purporting to reflect the "true value" of the attorney's services, is the appropriate starting point for determining the reasonable hourly rate), <span class="Italic">overruled by Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516, 1524 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding that the prevailing market rate is the appropriate basis for calculating fees for private attorneys who represent individuals "at reduced rates reflecting non-economic goals"). It purports to show the prevailing market rates for attorneys in the District of Columbia. <span class="Italic">Bywaters v. United States</span>, 670 F.3d 1221, 1226 &#x0026; n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia maintains an updated version of the matrix. The Board has found that an attorney's customary billing rate, rather than the market rate of recovery, is the appropriate rate for private attorneys who charge below the prevailing community rate in connection with Board appeals, noting that there is no public policy to encourage the filing of adverse action appeals. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 523, 530 (1991) (rejecting the application of the rationale of <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains</span> to Board appeals).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agreement stated, "After these [$6,000] are paid, client will not be charged additionally [sic] legal fees." It went on to state that, "in the event of a successful resolution, the agency will be charged," and that the appellant agreed to request fees at the current <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The Board has found it appropriate to base a fee award on the lodestar amount even if the fee agreement called for a flat fee. <span class="Italic">See generally Ruble v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 44, &#x00B6; 13 n.* (2004). Therefore, we find it appropriate to calculate fees in this appeal using the lodestar amount despite the flat fee arrangement that the appellant and his counsel selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued, and the administrative judge found, that the maximum reasonable fee was the $250 per hour listed as an option in the retainer agreement. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A contract for services that contains an hourly rate is strong evidence of the local market rate because the client freely agreed to pay that rate. <span class="Italic">Willis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 245 F.3d 1333, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Here, the fee structure agreed to was not hourly billing at $250 per hour. However, the contract seems to have provided that as an option, albeit an option not selected. In addition, the appellant's attorney acknowledges that she did offer a billing rate of $250 per hour to some clients who agreed to be billed monthly and pay even if they lost their cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the attorney's affidavit asserts that she billed the appellant's case at the rate of $510 per hour. It characterizes this as her customary rate, reasonable and consistent with the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix.[9] The affidavit also asserts that "when they are able to pay," the attorney customarily charges clients in employment cases at rates "similar to those set out in the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The affidavit, though, is lacking in that it fails to identify even a single case in which she charged a client $510 per hour or any other comparable rate. Instead, the affidavit points to two Board cases where respondent agencies reportedly paid the appellant's attorney <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates as part of a settlement agreement, and several Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) cases in which she was reportedly awarded <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 27. We do not find that this evidence outweighs <span id="Page_4695"></span>the specific evidence that the customary rate was, in fact, $250 per hour. <span class="Italic">Cf. Andrus v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 681, 686 (1993) (finding that an administrative judge erred in relying on fees awarded to an appellant's counsel in addendum initial decisions in other appeals because such decisions were not precedential). This evidence includes both the fee agreement and the attorney's admission on petition for review that she "did offer some employees the rate of $250 an hour."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix included in the appellant's fee petition lists $510 as the hourly rate for attorneys with 20 or more years of experience in the years 2013-2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant's attorney suggests that she would have charged the appellant $510 per hour but instead offered a reduced rate due to the appellant's inability to pay, the administrative judge rightly found that this claim is not supported by the record. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ishikawa v. Department of Labor</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 258, 260 (1985) (counsel successfully rebutted the presumption that the agreed upon rate was the maximum fee awardable by showing that she had agreed upon that rate only because of the employee's reduced ability to pay and that her customary fee for similar work was significantly higher). On review, the appellant disputes this finding by pointing to the underlying removal appeal and purported testimony that the appellant had no income. Again, we are not persuaded. We recognize that an employee appealing his removal may be without an income for some period of time. But that, by itself, does not constitute sufficient evidence that this appellant was billed at less than $510 per hour due to a reduced ability to pay. Moreover, as discussed above, the retainer agreement asserts that the appellant was provided a reduced rate because of his attorney's commitment to civil rights. It contains no indication that the rate was the result of an inability to pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With the petition for review, the appellant submitted an affidavit from another attorney in the community who practices before the Board, describing his billing practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(2)-(3) (in addition to the fee agreement and a statement of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work, a fee petition also must include evidence that the rate is consistent with the prevailing community rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney ordinarily practices). The petition argues that this constitutes new evidence, not previously available, despite due diligence. According to the appellant's attorney, she previously sought out attorneys who prevailed before the Board, but was unable to locate any. We are not persuaded that due diligence was exercised given that Board decisions are publicly available on the internet, at <a href="http://www.mspb.gov/decisions/decisions.htm">http://www.mspb.gov/decisions/decisions.htm</a>, and list the names of the parties' representatives. With little effort, the appellant's attorney should have determined that she could contact identified prevailing appellants' attorneys at any time. Accordingly, we will not consider this allegedly new evidence. <span class="Italic">See Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980) (under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115, the Board generally will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with the petition for review absent a showing that it was unavailable before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, the appellant bore the burden of showing that the requested fees were reasonable, including providing evidence of his attorney's customary rate and that the rate was consistent with the prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney ordinarily practices. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(3); <span class="Italic">see Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 10 (an appellant must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the amount of attorney fees claimed is reasonable); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Department of Transportation</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 596, 602 (1984) (the burden of establishing the reasonableness of hours and rates claimed is on the moving party). Based on the evidence discussed above, we find no error in the administrative judge's determination that the appellant was entitled to fees at a rate of $250 per hour, rather than the requested $510 per hour. <span class="Italic">See also Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 172, &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (the administrative judge who decided the case on the merits after a hearing is in the best position to evaluate the evidence submitted by counsel to determine the quality of representation afforded and whether the amount requested is reasonable).</p>

This evidence alone is insufficient. Unlike with Mr. Atkins, Mr. Yeressian presented no evidence of Mr. Brawner's education, experience, and other relevant qualifications, and failed to submit persuasive evidence of the rate of other attorneys with similar expertise and experience.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The second approach is to use the "Kavanaugh Matrix," advanced by economist Dr. Michael Kavanaugh, which makes adjustments to the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix based on changes to the Legal Services Index ("LSI") component of the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). <span class="Italic">Bywaters</span>, 670 F.3d at 1226 &#x0026; n.4; <span class="Italic">Eley v. District of Columbia</span>, 999 F. Supp.2d 137, 150 (D.D.C. 2013), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded by</span> 793 F.3d 97 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The motivation behind these adjustments is to provide adjustments that solely capture the market for legal services and do not take other consumer goods into account, such as food, housing, gas, and clothing. <span class="Italic">See Salazar v. District of Columbia</span>, 750 F. Supp.2d 70, 73 (D.D.C. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both approaches are subject to criticism and no circuit has expressly adopted one over the other. <span class="Italic">See Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. District of Columbia</span>, 809 F.3d 58, 64-65 (D.C. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">Bywaters</span>, 670 F.3d at 1226 &#x0026; n.4; <span class="Italic">Interfaith Cmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc</span>., 426 F.3d 694, 709-10 (3d Cir. 2005). The Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix has been criticized because it takes a broad basket of goods and services into account, including food and fuel, and may thus yield results that are higher or lower than the average rates private consumers of legal services in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area actually pay. <span class="Italic">See Salazar v. District of Columbia</span>, 123 F. Supp.2d 8, 14-15 (D.D.C. 2000). The Kavanaugh Matrix has been criticized for its use of the national CPI, and may thus not be an accurate measure of the relevant community, here the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. <span class="Italic">See Eley</span>, 999 F. Supp.2d at 152.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The criticisms levied against both the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix and the Kavanaugh Matrix are well-founded and reasonable. Conversely, the arguments for each are also compelling. Consequently, we decline to exclusively endorse either for use in a lodestar calculation. The decision to use either matrix as a starting point to determine a lodestar is within the discretion of a trial court. <span class="Italic">See Interfaith Cmty. Org</span>., 426 F.3d at 709 ("[t]he original <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is an appropriate starting point...."); <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 57 F.3d at 1109 (noting that the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix provides a "useful starting point."). However, it would be an abuse of discretion for a court to blindly use either matrix without considering all the relevant facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Eley v. District of Columbia</span>, 793 F.3d 97, 104 (D.C. Cir. 2015). As previously noted, though a court has broad discretion in computing a lodestar, the court must "provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 437. This includes the decision to use either the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix or the Kavanaugh Matrix and any departure, or no departure, from the rates they suggest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Court of Federal Claims compared the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate with fees awarded to counsel's law firm in two district court cases and found those rates lower than, if not comparable to, the Adjusted Laffey rates. In doing so, the Court of Federal Claims explained that the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate was sufficient to adequately compensate counsel, but not so high as to be a "windfall" to counsel. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 444.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the Court of Federal Claims to rely on fee awards from other jurisdictions in determining the fee award in this case. However, because counsel had previously requested fees based on a "national" rate, the use of awards from other jurisdictions as a comparative base was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims did not abuse its discretion in its determination that the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix provided a reasonable rate for the lodestar calculation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A question was raised as to proper rates of attorneys under the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, and whether it should be used in administrative litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DL v. District of Columbia</span>, <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/1C52A7E77CAB5679852584010052C779/$file/18-7004-1788691.pdf">924 F.3d 585</a>, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Judge Sentelle dissenting). FLRA mentioned, but did not develop issues raised in DL. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1633 and VA DeBakey VAMC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-38.html">71 FLRA 211</a>, 219 (2019) (Concurring opinion of Member Abbott).</p>
