<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-362"><span class="space">2.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Status Quo </span></span>Remedy Required</h4>
<p class="noindent">The use of a <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy depends in part on whether the agency failed to bargain on substance or impact, <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 505</span>, 59 FLRA 387, 388 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency has an obligation to bargain over the substance of a matter, and fails to meet that obligation, the Authority will grant a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy in the absence of special circumstances<span class="Italic">. See Air Force Logistics Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 53 FLRA 1664, 1671 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Robins Air Force Base</span>). By contrast, where an agency has an obligation to bargain over only the impact and implementation of a matter, and fails to meet that obligation, the Authority applies the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA 604, to determine whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is appropriate<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Golden, Colo.</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 13 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">The remedy is considered on a case-by-case basis under <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604 (1982), <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 70 FLRA 119, 121, 124 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the remedy, the Judge applied the criteria set forth by the Authority in FCI for determining whether an SQA remedy is appropriate.[15] In <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, the Authority found that determining whether an SQA remedy is appropriate requires consideration of the following factors: (1) whether, <span id="page_1634"></span>and when, the agency gave notice concerning the action or change; (2) whether, and when, the union requested impact-and-implementation bargaining regarding the action or change; (3) the willfulness of the agency's conduct in failing to properly bargain under the Statute; (4) the nature and extent of the impact experienced by adversely affected employees; and (5) whether, and to what degree, an SQA remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 23 (citing <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA at 606).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;8 FLRA at 606.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Where, as here, a judge has granted an SQA remedy based on a finding that an agency committed a ULP by violating its duty to engage in impact-and-implementation bargaining, and a party challenges that remedy, the Authority applies the factors established in <span class="Italic">FCI</span>[69] to determine whether the SQA remedy is deficient.[70] The <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors are set forth in Section II.B., above. The appropriateness of an SQA remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that such a remedy would cause.[71] And when an agency argues that an SQA remedy would disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations, the Authority requires that the agency's argument be "based on record evidence."[72]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In discharging its responsibilities under the statute, the Authority is vested with wide discretion to fashion appropriate remedies for violations of any provisions of the statute. Thus, contrary to the judge's conclusion, <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedies may be issued in certain refusal to bargain cases even when the agency's decision itself was not negotiable. Where, as here, management has exercised its reserved rights under section 7106 of the statute without fulfilling its duty to bargain with the exclusive representative concerning the procedures it will observe in the exercise thereof and regarding appropriate arrangements for bargaining unit employees adversely affected thereby, pursuant to sections 7106(b)(2) and 7106(b)(3) of the statute, respectively, the Authority on occasion has issued orders requiring a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. However, the appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that would be caused by such a remedy. Accordingly, in determining whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would be appropriate in any specific case involving a violation of the duty to bargain over impact and implementation, the Authority considers, among other things, (1) whether, and when, notice was given to the union by the agency concerning the action or change decided upon; (2) whether, and when, the union requested bargaining on the procedures to be observed by the agency in implementing such action or change and/or concerning appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by such action or change; (3) the willfullness of the agency's conduct in failing to discharge its bargaining obligations under the statute; (4) the nature and extent of the impact experienced by adversely affected employees; and (5) whether, and to what degree, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Judge, we find that the record supports the GC's request for an SQA remedy. The Judge found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the GC met the first three <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors. Specifically, the Judge found that: (1) "the [Agency] gave [the Union] notice of [the] change"; (2) "the Union demanded to bargain"; and (3) the Agency's "failure to discharge its bargaining obligation was willful." We adopt the Judge's findings concerning the first three <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor, the GC argues that the Judge erred by finding "that there was nothing in the record addressing" the adverse impact of the policy change on affected employees. In considering the entire record in this case, we agree with the GC that the record supports finding that the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency failed to present any evidence to contradict the GC's contention that the change in the on-call policy had an adverse impact on employees. The Agency did not file an answer to the complaint or respond to the GC's summary-judgment motion--including the GC's request for an SQA remedy. This failure to respond constitutes an admission of the GC's version of the facts.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.20(b). <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Beard v. Banks</span>, 548 U.S. 521, 527 (2006) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)) (when a party fails to respond to a factual assertion supporting a motion for summary judgment, this failure constitutes an admission of the movant's version of the facts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the facts, the unilateral change to the on-call policy, on its face, adversely affects employees in a way that is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> because the change reduced the time within which employees are required to report to work, from forty-five minutes to thirty minutes. In this regard, the Authority has held that changes in work schedules that are more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> support an SQA remedy under the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor.[16] Here, a 33.3% reduction in the employees' allotted time to report to work after being called in has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> adverse effect on the employees. Further, as the GC asserted, and as the Agency effectively admits, "[i]t is reasonably foreseeable...that not all employees will be able to reach the hospital in [thirty] minutes and will either be disciplined or will no longer be eligible for on-call assignments." In support, the GC submitted a sworn affidavit from a Union official who affirmed that bargaining-unit members were experiencing "problems" with the new on-call policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the record supports finding that an SQA remedy is appropriate under the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor, and we grant the GC's exception on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor, the GC argues that the Judge erred by placing the burden on the GC to establish whether an SQA remedy would be disruptive to the Agency's operations. Specifically, the GC contends that the Judge erred by denying its request for an SQA remedy based, in part, on his finding that there was no evidence in the record concerning the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor. The Authority has held that "a conclusion that a[n SQA] remedy would be disruptive to the operations of an agency [must] be 'based on <span class="Italic">record evidence</span>,'" and that "[i]n the absence of record evidence establishing that a[n SQA] remedy is not appropriate, the Authority should restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>."[21] Here, the Agency did not respond to the GC's summary-judgment motion, and did not provide any record evidence that an SQA remedy would "disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of [its] operations."[22] Accordingly, we find that the Judge erred to the extent that he considered the absence of evidence concerning the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor as weighing against the appropriateness of an SQA remedy. We, therefore, grant the GC's exception on this issue.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, balancing the nature and circumstances of the Agency's failure to meet its obligation to bargain under the Statute, and the lack of evidence of any disruption to government operations that an SQA remedy would cause, we find that an SQA remedy is appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 43</span>, 64 FLRA 586, 593-94 (2010), declined to upset an arbitrator's imposition of a modified <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy in response to a unilateral change in past practice concerning release and recall of intermittent employees when the agency unsuccessfully argued that the remedy would cause undue disruption to its operations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the modified SQA remedy is contrary to Authority precedent.&#x2003;Where an arbitrator has found a ULP and granted an SQA remedy, and a party has excepted to that remedy, the Authority has applied statutory standards to determine whether the remedy was deficient. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DHS, U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.,</span> 63 FLRA 505, 510 (2009) (applying statutory "special circumstances" standard to assess SQA remedy in case involving failure to bargain over substance of management decision). We note that, in a case where an arbitrator declined to award an SQA remedy in connection with an agency's failure to bargain over the impact and implementation of a management decision, the Authority stated that it "should uphold an arbitrator's remedy determinations unless it can be shown that these determinations are 'a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 48 FLRA 566, 567 (1993) (citations and emphasis omitted). However, in that case, the Authority also assessed whether the arbitrator's award was "consistent with the remedial approach" set forth in <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution,</span> 8 FLRA 604, 606 (1982) (<span class="Italic">FCI</span>). <span class="Italic">FCI</span> established the factors that the Authority considers in determining whether an SQA remedy is appropriate where, as here, an agency has failed to bargain over the impact and implementation of a management decision. <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 48 FLRA at 567. Consistent with this precedent, we apply the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors to determine whether the Arbitrator's remedy is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors are: (1) whether and when notice was given to the union by the agency concerning the change; (2) whether and when the union requested bargaining; (3) the willfulness of the agency's conduct in failing to discharge its bargaining obligation; (4) the nature and extent of the adverse impact on unit employees; and (5) whether and to what degree an SQA remedy would disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Jacksonville, Fla.,</span> 63 FLRA 365, 370 (2009). The appropriateness of an SQA remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that would be caused by such a remedy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> When an agency argues that an SQA remedy would disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations, the Authority requires that the agency's argument be "based on record evidence." <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Def. Commissary Agency, Peterson Air Force Base, Colo. Springs, Colo.,</span> 61 FLRA 688, 695 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the modified SQA remedy would cause undue interruption to agency operations.&#x2003;However, the Agency does not cite any record evidence that supports a claim that the remedy would disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations. Accordingly, we find that the Agency's argument regarding disruption does not demonstrate that the remedy is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Authority decisions cited by the Agency, two of those decisions involved requests for SQA relief that would have required the respective agencies to undo reorganizations. <span class="Italic">See Transportation,</span> 19 FLRA at 477; <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 19 FLRA at 436-37. The modified SQA remedy here does not require the Agency to undo its reorganization; it merely requires the Agency to return to its previous practice regarding release of temporary-intermittent employees from tours of duty. As such, <span class="Italic">Transportation</span> and <span class="Italic">FAA</span> are inapposite. With respect to <span class="Italic">HUD,</span> 58 FLRA 33, that case involved a request for an SQA remedy that was impossible to implement because the employee who previously performed the duties at issue had retired, and there had been no finding of a practice regarding rotating the duties among certain employees, as the General Counsel had requested. Here, by contrast, there is no basis for finding that it would be impossible for the Agency to reinstate the past practice that the Arbitrator found, and there was a finding that such a practice existed. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">HUD</span> also is inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy was set aside when an arbitrator did not consider the impact of the remedy, and FLRA determined, <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, based on the record that the remedy was sufficiently disruptive under the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> criteria that only prospective bargaining over impact of the change in work assignment practices would be required, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NIST and FOP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-36.html">71 FLRA 199</a>, 199-202 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we revisit the factors which arbitrators must consider in determining whether a <span class="Italic">status-quo-ante</span> (SQA) remedy is appropriate. Here, the Arbitrator did not consider the <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution</span> (<span class="Italic">FCI</span>)[1] factors when he erroneously determined that an SQA remedy was warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;8 FLRA 604, 606 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Sean J.&#x2003;Rogers found that the Agency violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement when it implemented a senior corporal policy (policy) that entailed additional tasks for the most senior corporal when no supervisor was on shift. He ordered that the Agency rescind the <span id="page_1636"></span>policy and provide the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain if the Agency were to decide to reintroduce the policy in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency correctly argues that the Arbitrator erroneously failed to apply the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors when he determined that an SQA remedy was warranted. Applying <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, we find that the degree to which an SQA remedy would disrupt and impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations renders that remedy inappropriate. Therefore, we modify the award to vacate the SQA remedy, and, instead, order the Agency to engage in post-implementation bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In March 2017, the Agency did not have enough supervisors to cover each shift without incurring overtime. Accordingly, the police chief developed the policy, which established additional tasks and expectations for the most senior corporal to perform when no supervisor was on a shift--contacting supervisors if problems arose during the shift, "step[ping] up" in the absence of supervisors, and completing and certifying time and attendance forms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In April 2017, the Union filed a grievance over the policy. It alleged that the Agency violated the parties' agreement because it implemented the policy prior to negotiating with the Union. The Agency stated that the policy's impact on staff would be <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> but that it would be willing to "discuss the impact and implementation of this change" with the Union. The Agency also argued that the Union never submitted negotiable proposals or met with the Agency. The grievance advanced to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained the grievance.&#x2003;He found that the Agency made a change to conditions of employment that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and that it failed to properly notify and bargain with the Union prior to implementation. Specifically, he found that the police chief only offered to "discuss" rather than "negotiate" the change, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the Agency's obligations under the agreement and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also determined that the change was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> because the policy "fundamentally pushe[d] supervisory duties and responsibilities, known and unknown, down into the bargaining unit and on to the [police officers] who are not supervisors." He found that the policy conflicted with the officers' non-supervisory position descriptions and concluded that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b). As a remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to rescind the policy, and to provide notice and an opportunity to bargain to the Union, if it reintroduced any form of the policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator failed to appropriately consider the factors outlined in <span class="Italic">FCI</span> when he determined that an SQA remedy was warranted. Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator failed to consider whether an SQA remedy would disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations, as it "would require the Agency to staff each shift with a supervisory employee," resulting in "substantial overtime."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In ordering the Agency to rescind the policy, the Arbitrator ordered an SQA remedy without so much as a passing reference, or citation, to <span class="Italic">FCI</span>. In <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, the Authority outlined five factors to consider when determining whether an SQA remedy is appropriate when an agency violated its statutory duty to engage in impact and implementation bargaining.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;8 FLRA at 606 ((1) whether, and when, notice was given to the union by the agency concerning the action or change decided upon; (2) whether and when, the union requested bargaining on the procedures to be observed by the agency in implementing such action or change and/or concerning appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by such action or change; (3) the willfulness of the agency's conduct in failing to discharge its bargaining obligations under the Statute; (4) the nature and extent of the impact experienced by adversely affected employees; and (5) whether, and to what degree, an SQA remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an arbitrator who finds a violation of a contractual duty to bargain derives remedial authority from the violated agreement and is not required to apply the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors.[13] However, this distinction between a contractual and a statutory duty to bargain is not warranted[14] unless the contract language indicates that the contractual bargaining obligations differ substantively from the obligations that the Statute imposes.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the dissent that it is necessary for us to conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review and to properly apply the FCI factors.[23] We find that ordering an SQA remedy, under these circumstances, will not effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Conducting a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the entire record, we find the Agency's arguments (which are entirely ignored by the Arbitrator and the dissent) to be particularly compelling and most relevant here. An SQA remedy would result in substantial overtime costs. There are only two supervisors and they would be required to provide adequate staffing during the twenty-four hour, seven-days-per-week schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the relevant <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors, we conclude that an SQA remedy is not only unnecessary to enforce the purposes of the Statute but it would result in unnecessary overtime payments and would disrupt and impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations.[26] It is not difficult to surmise that one is the consequence of the other.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Where management makes a unilateral change regarding a negotiable condition of employment, the effectuation of the purposes and policies of the Statute requires the imposition of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy, absent special circumstances, in order not to render meaningless the mutual obligation to negotiate concerning changes in conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. E.g., Veterans Administration, West Los Angeles Medical</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Los Angeles, California</span>, 23 FLRA 278, 281 (1986). As the decision to institute the sign-out board was itself negotiable, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is warranted in this case, absent special circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no basis in the circumstances of this case on which to conclude that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is unwarranted because of Triplett's retirement. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. As acknowledged in the Respondent's exceptions, the sign-out board continues to exist as a condition of employment within the bargaining unit<span class="Italic">. Cf. Veterans Administration Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona</span>, 24 FLRA 758 (1986), <span class="Italic">Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration</span>, 25 FLRA 659 (1987) (<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> not ordered where practice that agency unilaterally discontinued was the product of an agreement made as to one specific employee who was no longer employed by the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the alleged acceptance of the sign-out board by Triplett's successor does not make a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy inappropriate. The exclusive representative, not the individual employee, is responsible for representing all unit employees in agreeing to conditions of employment in the bargaining unit where exclusive recognition exists. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> <span class="Italic">v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company</span>, 388 U.S. 175, 180, (1967) (national labor policy "extinguishes the individual employee's power to order his own relations with his employer and creates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interests of all employees....&#8197;Thus only the union may contract the employee's terms and conditions of employment[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent">Odd results may flow from the imposition of an SQA remedy. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, AFLC, Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 53 FLRA 1664, 1671-72 (1998), shop employees were permitted to use a phone in a supervisor's office to take and make personal calls. After the supervisor discovered her desk was opened a couple of times, she locked her office and moved the phone outside the office and placed it on a small table. That led to a ULP charge. FLRA determined that an SQA remedy was appropriate because availability of telephones for personal calls is a negotiable subject matter. However, FLRA suggested, the supervisor could lock her office as a matter of agency internal security, and any adverse effects flowing from that action would be negotiable only as to impact. The result was that modification of phone access was redressable through an SQA remedy, but modification of office access was not. Although FLRA's General Counsel had not charged a ULP as to securing the office, the remedy it sought was for the phone to be placed into the supervisor's unlocked office. FLRA's legalistic approach was to put the phone back into the locked office; on a realistic note, however, FLRA directed bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has broad discretion under the Statute to fashion appropriate remedies for unfair labor practices.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In the absence of special circumstances, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is appropriate in cases where, as here, an agency has refused to bargain over the substance of a matter that is within its duty to bargain<span class="Italic">. See Veterans Administration, West Los Angeles Medical Center</span>, <span class="Italic">Los Angeles, California</span>, 23 FLRA 278, 281 (1986) <span class="Italic">(West Los</span> <span class="Italic">Angeles Medical Center</span>). The purpose of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is to place parties, including employees, in the positions they would have been in had there been no unlawful conduct. <span class="Italic">See Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center</span>, <span class="Italic">Asheville, North Carolina</span>, 51 FLRA 1572, 1580 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center)</span>. Other "traditional" remedies, including retroactive bargaining orders and cease-and-desist orders accompanied by the posting of a notice to employees (which are provided in virtually all cases where a violation is found), are also available.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 161 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this precedent, since the decision to move the telephone was itself negotiable, we agree with the General Counsel that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is warranted, absent special circumstances. <span class="Italic">See West Los Angeles Medical</span> <span class="Italic">Center</span>, 23 FLRA at 281. However, contrary to the General Counsel's assertions, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy in this case would not return the telephone to the supervisor's <span class="Italic">unlocked</span> office....&#8197;The conduct challenged in this case was the Respondent's relocation of the telephone. We have concluded above that this was an unfair labor practice as charged. Prior to this unlawful act, the telephone was located inside the supervisor's office. In these circumstances, a properly tailored <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would return the telephone to the supervisor's <span class="Italic">now-locked</span> office, thereby, placing employees in the positions they would have occupied absent the Respondent's unlawful act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no basis to require as a remedy for the Respondent's unfair labor practice that the office be unlocked. In this regard, there is no dispute that the Respondent's decision to lock the supervisor's office constituted an exercise of its right to determine internal security practices under section 7106(a) of the Statute. Therefore, as the Respondent's decision to lock the office was not alleged to constitute a violation under the Statute, we will not order the Respondent to unlock the office, which would turn the clock back not only on the location of the telephone, but also on the decision to lock the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the relief requested by the General Counsel is not a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> prior to the Respondent's unlawful conduct, we do not order the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy sought by the General Counsel. Instead, to remedy the violation found above, we order the Respondent to cease and desist from changing conditions of employment without satisfying its bargaining obligations, and direct the Respondent to bargain, upon request of the Union, over the use and location of a telephone for employees' personal use.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decisions below, some predating the 1990 changes in FLRA methodology concerning recovery of benefits in cases involving failures to bargain egregious enough to warrant a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> order, illustrate the approach taken by FLRA in specific factual situations involving claimed loss of benefits.</p>
