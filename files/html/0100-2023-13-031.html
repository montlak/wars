<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-32"><span id="page_534"></span><span class="space">IV.</span> GOVERNMENT-WIDE REGULATIONS</h2>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7117:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the duty to bargain in good faith shall, to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation, extend to matters which are the subject of any rule or regulation only if the rule or regulation is not a Government-wide rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA ODAR and Ass'n ALJs, IFPTE,</span> 64 FLRA 1000, 1002 n.5 (2010), defined the scope of government wide regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...However, none of the rules or regulations cited by the Agency are "government-wide rules or regulations[,]" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7117(a) of the Statute, because they are not "generally applicable throughout the Federal Government." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 827 F.2d 814, 816-18 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU, Chapter 6</span>, 3 FLRA 747, 751-56 (1980) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, at 51 (1978) ("The term 'Government-wide' shall be construed literally; only those regulations which affect the <span class="Italic">Federal civilian work force as a whole </span>are 'Government-wide' regulations...." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">cf. Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 54 FLRA 1316, 1322 (1998) (finding that parties' agreement "superseded" conflicting Agency regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a proposal is contrary to a government-wide regulation, it is not negotiable. The exemption essentially permits the government to pull a subject out of the bargaining process by issuing a government-wide rule that creates a regime inconsistent with bargaining. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246, 1251 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Most but not all government-wide regulations affecting labor negotiations are issued by OPM. According to <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 59 FLRA 331, 347 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, where a provision establishes requirements that are different from the requirements of a Government-wide regulation, that provision is inconsistent with the regulation<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3157</span>, 44 FLRA 1570, 1577 (1992); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 35-36 (1991), <span class="Italic">enf'd in part, vacated and remanded in part United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1931</span>, 32 FLRA at 1057-58<span class="Italic">. Cf. POPA</span>, 48 FLRA 546, 550 (1993) (<span class="Italic">POPA III</span>) (provision is not inconsistent with a regulation because it incorporates the requirements of the regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent">If parties rely on the application of government-wide regulations in a negotiability case, it is the duty of the proponent to provide those regulations to FLRA, since its ruling will be based only on what is presented to it. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist.</span>, 22 FLRA 513 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The government-wide regulation exception to an agency's obligation to bargain is not conditioned on the need to bargain over appropriate arrangements<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Campbell Dist., Third Region and AFGE Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 191-95 (1990), reviewing an arbitration award, clarified the role of government-wide regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rules and Regulations Within the Meaning of Section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has clearly indicated that the terms "rule, or regulation" as used in section 7122(a)(1) include any enforceable Government-wide rule or regulation. Therefore, when the party excepting to an arbitration award has established that the award is contrary to an enforceable Government-wide rule or regulation, the Authority has found the award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Chicago, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, Local 1395, 34 FLRA 1107 (1990) (award contrary to 41 C.F.R. 101-18.101).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Government-wide rules or regulations are rules, regulations, or official declarations of policy that are generally applicable throughout the Federal Government and are binding on the Federal agencies and Federal officials to which they apply. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 6 and Internal Revenue Service, New Orleans District,</span> 3 FLRA 747, 754-55 (1980). Under section 7117 of the Statute, Government-wide rules and regulations bar the negotiation of, and agreement on, union proposals that conflict with them. Accordingly, Government-wide rules and regulations govern a matter in dispute to which they apply, even if the same matter is covered by a collective bargaining agreement under the Statute. The only limitation on the supremacy of Government-wide rules or regulations is set forth in section 7116(a)(7) of the Statute, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an agency "to enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation implementing section 2302 of this title) which is in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed[.]" Thus, under section 7116(a)(7), a Government-wide rule or regulation, which does not implement 5 U.S.C. 2302, is not controlling with respect to a conflicting provision of a collective bargaining agreement that was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed. Therefore, we will not find an arbitration award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) as contrary to a Government-wide rule or regulation (other than one implementing section 2302) when the award is consistent with an applicable collective bargaining agreement that was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed. Otherwise, we will continue to apply section 7122(a)(1) to find all arbitration awards that conflict with a Government-wide rule or regulation to be deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiability of proposals that are alleged by management to be inconsistent with government-wide regulations was also explored in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 625, 647-50 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized two distinct grounds for finding a bargaining proposal outside the duty to bargain because it conflicts with a law or Government-wide regulation. 5 USC 7117(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Authority has consistently held that matters concerning conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining when they are within the discretion of an agency and are not otherwise inconsistent with law or applicable rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 681-82 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and</span> <span class="Italic">Printing), aff'd mem. Sub. Nom. Bureau of Engraving and</span> <span class="Italic">Printing v. FLRA</span>, No. 95-1499 (D.C. Cir. May 23, 1996). However, negotiation over the exercise of agency discretion has been found to be outside the duty to bargain where a law or regulation indicates that an agency's discretion is intended to be exercised only by the agency--referred to by the Authority as "sole and exclusive" discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 682 n.8. <span class="Italic">See also Illinois National Guard v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">National Guard</span>). In the absence of an indication in the wording or in the legislative or regulatory history of a provision that the agency's discretion is sole and exclusive, the Authority has found that it is not. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA at 692; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">3295 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Thrift</span> <span class="Italic">Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA 884, 894-99 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 46 F.3d 73 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">Second, proposals have been found to be inconsistent with law or regulation and, thus, outside the duty to bargain, where they mandate that an agency apply a standard or procedure that is contrary to the law or regulation.[11] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association</span>, 40 FLRA at 441-43. The fact that an agency's discretion may be bargained does not necessarily mean that the discretion is unlimited. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Prior to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, the Authority's analysis of claims under section 7117I did not always distinguish clearly between these two types of allegations. That is, the Authority would treat an argument that a proposal was inconsistent with an agency's sole and exclusive discretion as one raising both that issue and the issue whether the proposal was otherwise substantively inconsistent with the law granting the discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Overseas Education</span>, 40 FLRA at 441-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This second category of proposals found to conflict with law or regulation is illustrated by several principles established in Authority precedent.[12] For example, where a regulation calls for a case-by-case determination as to whether the standard it establishes has been met, the Authority has held that a proposal that, in effect, made a blanket determination that the standard had been met was outside the duty to bargain because it was inconsistent with the regulation. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury <span id="page_535"></span>Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service</span>, 23 FLRA 681, 682-83 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>). Such a requirement for a case-by-case determination has been found explicitly in the regulation. <span class="Italic">Overseas Education</span>, 40 FLRA at 428-31 (regulation may "be waived by the head of the agency upon determination that unusual circumstances in an individual case justify such action"). This requirement has also been found to be stated implicitly. In this regard, where a regulation requires consideration of specific criteria as applied to particular facts, the Authority has interpreted it to require a case-by-case determination. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service</span>, 23 FLRA at 683 (finding regulation that prevents the disclosure of records where it may "create an unfair advantage" or "compromise the utility" of the selection process to incorporate a standard that must be applied to the particular circumstances presented on a case-by-case basis).[13] In determining whether a regulation requires a case-by-case determination, the Authority is guided by the provisions of the regulation itself, the legislative intent of the statutes that the regulation implements, and court decisions addressing the regulation and those statutes<span class="Italic">. Overseas Education</span>, 40 FLRA at 428-31, 441-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The types of proposals discussed herein are intended merely to illustrate--not define--the scope of this category.</p>

FLRA</span>, 727 F.2d 481, 489-90 (5th Cir. 1984) (finding that specificity of the factors set forth to determine "greatest advantage to the Government" in choosing mode of travel mandates case-by-case determination) (<span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has found proposals to be inconsistent with a regulation where the regulation states an express standard governing the exercise of an agency's authority, and the proposal either expanded or contracted that regulatory standard. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1458 and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the U.S. Attorney, Southern District of Florida</span>, 29 FLRA 3, 4-5 (1987) (finding a proposal that contained a less rigorous standard--"an immediate risk to the employees' health and safety"--than regulation's "imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm" standard was outside the duty to bargain) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Attorney</span>).[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Treasury</span>, <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 35-36 (1991), <span class="Italic">decision and order</span> <span class="Italic">on request for reconsideration as to other matters</span>, 40 FLRA 849 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforced in part, vacated in part, and remanded in part</span> <span class="Italic">as to other matters</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Authority has found a proposal inconsistent with regulation where the proposal precluded an agency from doing something it is required to do under the regulation. For example, the Authority held outside the duty to bargain a proposal precluding an agency from taking disciplinary actions against employees who were found to use illegal drugs, because the regulation provided that an agency is required to "initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs[.]" <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Council of HUD Locals and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 43 FLRA 1405, 1409-13 (1992) (HUD).[15]</p>

<p class="noindent">If the regulation provides discretion to the agency, the discretionary margin is negotiable. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS C&#x0026;BP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-158.html">71 FLRA 808</a>, 810-11 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring), rejected an argument that a proposal concerning the location of a duty station was nonnegotiable because of exclusive agency discretion under regulation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it has sole and exclusive discretion when defining a bargaining&#8209;unit employee's official duty station under the regulations and the FTR. Specifically, the Agency cites FTR language stating that an official station is "an area defined by the agency,"[35] and regulatory wording defining an official duty station as an area "prescribed" by the agency, to support its assertion that it has sole and exclusive discretion to define an official duty station.[36] The Agency also requests that we reconsider our precedent regarding sole and exclusive discretion due to the wording in the FTR and the regulations. In analyzing claims of "sole and exclusive" discretion, the Authority looks at the plain wording and the legislative history of the statute in question.[38] In the absence of any indication that Congress intended the agency's discretion to be sole and exclusive, the exercise of discretion through collective bargaining is not inconsistent with law.[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency points to certain wording in &#x00A7; 300&#8209;3.1 of the FTR and the regulations to support its argument, the wording in the regulations does not demonstrate an intent to give the Agency "unfettered discretion."[41] In particular, the regulations and &#x00A7; 300&#8209;3.1 do not contain any language stating that they preempt the Federal Service Labor&#8209;Management Relations Statute or any other statute.[42] While the Authority does not require any specific wording,[43] the plain language in the regulations and &#x00A7; 300&#8209;3.1 do not evidence that the Agency's discretion in defining an official duty station is "sole and exclusive."[44] Moreover, the legislative history for the regulations[45] and &#x00A7; 300&#8209;3.1[46] do not demonstrate any intent to give agencies sole and exclusive authority over defining an official station or official duty station for travel compensation.[47] Consequently, we decline to reconsider our precedent regarding sole and exclusive discretion. Furthermore, we also find that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that Proposal 1 is outside the duty to bargain because it has sole and exclusive discretion.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although FLRA applies and interprets government-wide regulations, it cannot adjudicate their constitutionality. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 41 FLRA 1106, 1122 (1991). FLRA does not consider the effect of government-wide regulations that may be issued in the future when the it considers the present negotiability of a proposal. <span class="Italic">NFFE Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 49 FLRA 923, 935-36 (1994), concerning the negotiability of Proposal 4 for a monetary subsidy for commuting employees, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the fact that the law requires that guidelines will be issued for the programs authorized does not present a basis for finding that this particular proposal is inconsistent with the law itself.&#x2003;Upon issuance, those guidelines may provide a basis for a claim that a pending proposal that is inconsistent with them is nonnegotiable if the guidelines constitute Government-wide regulations within the meaning of section 7117 of the Statute. Of course, such regulations generally are not enforceable if they conflict with a provision of an existing collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7). However, the anticipated guidelines provide no basis for finding that this proposal is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal is not barred from negotiation because it fails to provide for each regulation or law that might affect its application. The failure of a proposal to treat related legal requirements does not place a provision outside the duty to bargain, unless the provision is inconsistent with those requirements. <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 135 (1987). The inconsistency must be with a specific regulation. Merit system principles are not to be used as bases for finding a proposal nonnegotiable, unless the proposal is contrary to a law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning the principle. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 21 FLRA 730, 731 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 33 and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Galveston</span>, 47 FLRA 765 (1993) ("a merit system principle alone is not a basis on which a proposal will be found nonnegotiable as conflicting with law"; a proposal that implicates a merit system principle will be found nonnegotiable only if it is established that the proposal conflicts with a law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning the merit system principle").</p>
<p class="noindent">An early decision describing the effect of government-wide regulation in a comprehensive manner was <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 6 and IRS, New Orleans Dist.</span>, 3 FLRA 748, 749-50 (1980). The agency long provided cost-free parking spaces to employees. The agency announced to the union that it was returning most of the prepaid parking spaces to the General Services Administration, and the union responded with a proposal that parking spaces not be released to GSA. The agency countered with a declaration of nonnegotiability, the union appealed, and the matter was placed before FLRA. As to the overall responsibility of an agency to bargain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, the duty of an agency to negotiate with an exclusive representative extends to the conditions of employment affecting employees in an appropriate unit except as provided otherwise by Federal law and regulation, including Government-wide regulation. That is, under the Statute, if a proposed matter relates to the conditions of employment of an appropriate unit of employees in an agency and is not inconsistent with law or regulation--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, is within the discretion of an agency--it is within the scope of bargaining which is required of that agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA moved on to determine that GSA Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) were government-wide regulations, 3 FLRA at 752:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The phrase "Government-wide rule or regulation" is used in two different subsections of section 7117 of the Statute. First of all, as here in issue, it is used in section 7117(a) to state a limitation on the scope of bargaining; <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, matters which are inconsistent with Government-wide rule or regulation are not within the duty to bargain. Secondly, it is used in section 7117(d) to state the right of an exclusive representative, in certain circumstances, to consult with respect to the issuance of such rules and regulations effecting any substantive change in any condition of employment. In neither of these contexts does the Statute precisely define what constitutes a "Government-wide rule or regulation" within the meaning of section 7117.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing the legislative history, FLRA continued, 3 FLRA at 754:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Congress intended the term "Government-wide regulation" to include those regulations and official declarations of policy which apply to the Federal civilian work force as a whole and are binding on the Federal agencies and officials to which they apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, while the legislative history of the term "Government-wide" indicates Congress intended that regulations which only apply to a limited segment of the Federal civilian work force not serve to limit the duty to bargain, it does not precisely define the outer limits of the reach required of a regulation in order for that regulation to be a "Government-wide" regulation within the meaning of section 7117. That is, it is unclear, for example, whether Congress intended that a regulation must apply to all employees in the Federal civilian work force in order to constitute a "Government-wide" regulation. In this regard, it is a basic rule of statutory construction that legislative enactments are to be construed so as to give them meaning. A requirement that a regulation apply to all Federal civilian employees in order to constitute a "Government-wide" regulation under section 7117 would render that provision meaningless, since it does not appear that there is any regulation which literally affects every civilian employee of the Federal Government. Furthermore, such a literal definition of the term would also render meaningless the concomitant right of a labor organization under section 7117(d) of the Statute in appropriate circumstances to consult with the issuing agency on Government-wide rules or regulations effecting substantive changes in any conditions in employment. In this regard, the legislative history of the Statute indicates that Congress intended the consultation rights provided in section 7117(d) to be substantial union rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determined that the GSA regulations were government-wide because they were codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, the regulations were binding on most but not all segments of the government, and the legislative history seemed to suggest that GSA property management regulations would meet the test of "government-wide" regulations. The second part of the negotiability test was whether the proposal was inconsistent with the GSA regulations, and for that answer, FLRA solicited an advisory opinion from GSA. GSA concluded that the regulations required agencies to relinquish excess parking space, that the agencies were responsible for making determinations as to what was excessive, and that unions were to have no say in the determination of what constituted excess space. But GSA cited nothing in its regulations that precluded negotiations over what constituted excess space. FLRA rejected GSA's conclusion of nonnegotiability because GSA failed to support the conclusion, and FLRA determined that it, rather than GSA, had the responsibility for making the determination as to bargaining obligations. FLRA concluded that the agency's duty to bargain extended to the aspect of the union proposal concerning the agency decision to relinquish parking space. [Other aspects of the parking space controversy are discussed as to this case in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-495.html#sec6-496">Facilities, Benefits for Employees</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">A court adopted the test that a government-wide regulation is defined by whether it is generally applicable throughout the federal government, i.e., applies to the civilian workforce as a whole, although not to every employee. A regulation that applies to one intergovernmental entity, e.g., the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, is not a government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. V. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1473, 1475 (D.C. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">A separate opinion by Chairman Calhoun on Proposal 2 articulated a limit in the application of the blocking effect of government-wide regulations that restate management rights, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 29 FLRA 380, 400 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Government-wide regulation which essentially restates a management right under section 7106 should not constitute a greater bar to bargaining than the statutory right itself. Accordingly, in those circumstances where I find that a proposal is a negotiable appropriate arrangement because it does not excessively interfere with a statutory right, I will not find the proposal to be nonnegotiable because it conflicts with a regulatory restatement of that right.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA was stating that OPM (or another agency) cannot diminish what Congress established as bargaining rights under the Reform Act. Statutory intent, rather than administrative interpretation, ultimately controls the bargaining equation. FLRA's result and reasoning were affirmed, <span class="Italic">OPM v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 165, 167-68, 171 (D.C. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...To permit regulations that merely recite section 7106(a) rights to prevent bargaining over appropriate arrangements is to read section 7106(b)(3) out of the statute....&#8197;OPM's interpretation, taken to its logical conclusion, would allow it and other agencies to circumvent section 7106(b)(3) simply by promulgating a regulation that tracked section 7106(a) word-for-word. This would amount to a power to issue a regulation that read: "No bargaining can occur over appropriate arrangements, even where section 7106(b)(3) would otherwise apply." OPM cannot prevent bargaining by issuing regulations that merely parrot statutory management rights which do not themselves prohibit bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress intended that section 7106(b)(3) would play a vital role in federal labor-management relations--a role that OPM's interpretation would nullify....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ection 7106(b)(3) provides that none of the management prerogatives...contained in section 7106(a) can bar negotiations over appropriate arrangements. Restating those prerogatives in regulation <span id="page_537"></span>form can give them no greater preclusive effect....&#8197;Our holding today does not preclude OPM from using its expertise to identify <span class="Italic">particular</span> arrangements that, if subject to bargaining, might threaten the governmental efficiency and merit objectives of the statute. OPM, however, must do more than simply set out rehashed versions of the statute in general terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have held that where a government-wide regulation is no more than a restatement of management prerogatives contained in section 7106(a), it cannot bar negotiations over "appropriate arrangements." The question remains: what constitutes a "restatement" of statutory prerogatives? We adopt a "practical effects" standard rather than a historical approach: the test depends neither on the origins of the regulation, nor on whether it developed prior to or independently from the statute, but rather on whether it provides management with new powers that it did not already have by virtue of section 7106(a), or directs the exercise of existing management prerogatives in a <span class="Italic">specific</span> way, so that <span class="Italic">particular</span> subjects or appropriate arrangements are identified as inappropriate topics of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this "practical effects" standard, Requirement 4 is a restatement of management prerogatives contained in section 7106(a)(2)(C). Requirement 4 refers to "management's right to select or not select from among a group of best qualified candidates," and "management's right to select from other appropriate sources." The direction to exercise the selection power to meet agency objectives, seek out fresh ideas, and promote affirmative action goals merely alludes in the most general way to basic objectives of government administration. It falls far short of being the product of OPM's expertise in specifying how management authority is to be exercised....&#8197;Requirement 4 provides management with no more substantive rights, and is no more specific, than section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">Applying <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, the D.C. Circuit decided that the OMB Circular A-76, precluding contract grievance and arbitration of union challenges to contracting-out decisions, was sufficient to bar negotiations on a proposal, tendered as an arrangement, that those disputes be subject to contract grievances. The court explained in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246, 1251 (D.C. Cir. 1993) [discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-123.html#sec6-124">Contracting Out</a>."]:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We held that the government could not gain the exemption from bargaining in section 7117(a) merely by restating with broader effect a provision in the management rights section. But we explained that the government could obtain the full benefit of the exemption if instead of developing new management powers not granted by the Act, it "directs the exercise of existing management prerogatives in a <span class="Italic">specific</span> way, so that <span class="Italic">particular</span> subjects or appropriate arrangements are identified as inappropriate topics of bargaining." <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 864 F.2d at 171....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OMB Circular meets this test; it sets forth substantive and procedural limitations, including detailed cost comparison criteria, that restrict agencies' prerogatives to contract out under the management rights section. The Circular does not purport to expand on management rights recognized in the statute; rather, it restricts rights already granted.</p>
