<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-88"><span class="space">c.</span> Prevailing Party</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit expanded on the concept of prevailing party in <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 884 F.2d 1378, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the underlying action...Mr. Naekel prevailed on four issues of the appeal, and did not prevail on two issues. He established entitlement to back pay for the 20-month period of his interim employment with the Army Reserve; this issue was conceded by the government, but only after it was appealed by Mr. Naekel. He also prevailed on the issues of entitlement to set off his job search and relocation expenses against his interim employment income; entitlement to back pay for the time needed to obtain release from his military position and move to his site of reinstatement; and entitlement to interest on back pay. He did not prevail on the issues of the grade progression at which his back pay would be calculated and the formula for overtime calculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not necessary to succeed on every issue to meet the criterion of "prevailing party" as contemplated by the EAJA....&#8197;We conclude that Mr. Naekel prevailed in the main, achieving more than "partial or limited success," although he did not receive all the relief he requested. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dellew Corp. v. United States</span>, 855 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (comments about the merits by the court during a hearing did not establish sufficient grounds to confer prevailing party status); <span class="Italic">A. Hirsh, Inc. v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 1240, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (neither remand to nor separate interlocutory decisions from a trial court create prevailing party status; look to "'victory' in the context of the litigation as a whole to discern whether the party has achieved the substantive relief it sought"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Toyama v. MSPB,</span> 481 F.3d 1361, 1367 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (suggesting that the petitioner file an EAJA petition for fees, without expressing an opinion on the merits, based upon a procedural reversal of the Board's decision to dismiss an appeal as untimely).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to what constitutes a "prevailing party" for purposes of EAJA, <span class="Italic">Olson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> determined that the phrase is not limited to a victory only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. A party could prevail, according to the legislative history, even if he succeeded only as to either an interim order central to his case or an interlocutory appeal sufficiently significant and discrete to be treated as a separate unit. But if a party wins on a purely procedural issue and obtains a remand, he is not a prevailing party. EAJA did not permit a fee award for a party who established his right to a hearing or demonstrated the need for a remand to permit the introduction of further evidence; the procedural issue divorced from the merits of the case would not establish prevailing party status. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 144 F.3d 794, 797 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("Our reversal of the Board's dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand of the case to the Board for further proceedings does not make Jarman, at this time, a prevailing party under the Equal Access of Justice Act."); <span class="Italic">Vidal v. USPS</span>, 143 F.3d 1475, 1480-81 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (noting the prematurity of an EAJA application submitted when the court's decision remanded the case on the merits to the Board for further analysis). A similar analysis was applied to the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act in <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Stewart</span>, 109 S. Ct. 202 (1988). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. O'Rourke</span>, 891 F.3d 976, 980-85 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (Judge Newman concurring in part and dissenting in part), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether a party that obtains a remand through a court appeal is a prevailing party depends on the nature of the remand, e.g., whether it is substantive, and whether the remand is the result of error of the agency whose decision <span id="Page_4617"></span>is being reviewed, as the Federal Circuit decided in <span class="Italic">Ward v. USPS</span>, 672 F.3d 1294, 1297-1300 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (not considering other elements of the EAJA equation), addressing a case remanded to the Board because of the Board's error in analysis of constitutional due process and statutory protections for federal employees in the adverse action process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under our legal system, parties ordinarily bear their own attorney's fees (i.e., the prevailing party is not automatically entitled to collect from the loser). <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Res.</span>, 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001). Congress, however, has statutorily authorized an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing party in some instances. For example, in the Equal Access to Justice Act ("EAJA"), Congress authorized prevailing parties to collect fees in actions against the United States provided that certain requirements are met. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, &#x00A7; 2412(d) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A). Thus, fees can only be awarded to "prevailing part[ies]" under EAJA if the government's position in the case was not "substantially justified," if no "special circumstances make an award unjust," and if the party seeking the award timely files its application for fees to the court. <span class="Italic">Comm'r, INS v. Jean</span>, 496 U.S. 154, 158 (1990). Only the "prevailing party" element is at issue in this appeal, as the government does not dispute Mr. Ward's contention that the other elements are met. In his application for attorney's fees, Mr. Ward asserts that he is a "prevailing party" under EAJA based on the remand he obtained from this court to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Whether Mr. Ward qualifies as a "prevailing party" under EAJA is a question of law. <span class="Italic">See Former Emps. of Motorola Ceramic Prods. v. United States</span>, 336 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Rader, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court provided guidance on the meaning of the "prevailing party" term in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>. 532 U.S. at 598. In particular, the Court explained that "'[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 603 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. Helms</span>, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987)). According to the Court, the extent of this relief must rise to the level of "enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees creat[ing] [a] 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 604. Under this rule, neither "an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim" nor a "reversal of a directed verdict" qualifies a plaintiff for prevailing party status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 605.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching the conclusion that it did, <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> explicitly overruled what had become known as the "catalyst theory." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 610. Under this theory, parties "could obtain a fee award if their suit acted as a 'catalyst' for the change they sought, even if they did not obtain a judgment or consent decree" in their favor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 625-26 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Federal courts had been applying the catalyst theory to hold that a party could qualify as "prevailing" so long as its ends were accomplished because of the litigation. The rule created by the majority in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> dismantled the catalyst theory by requiring enforceable judgments on the merits or court-ordered consent decrees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, EAJA was not specifically at issue in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, as that case involved the "prevailing party" term from a different attorney's fees statute. This court has concluded, however, that <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> applies with equal force in the EAJA context. <span class="Italic">Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. United States</span>, 288 F.3d 1371, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">see also Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1364 (explaining that the Supreme Court "has interpreted the phrase 'prevailing party' consistently in all federal fee-shifting statutes.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, a remand contained entirely within the federal judicial system (e.g., a remand from a federal appellate court to a district court) "at least in most circumstances, does not constitute relief on the merits for the purposes of the fee-shifting statutes." <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1364. As mentioned above, however, this appeal presents a different type of remand: a remand from a federal court to an agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We addressed whether an agency remand can result in prevailing party status under EAJA in <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1360. In that case, two employees who had been dismissed from their jobs applied to the Department of Labor ("DOL") for benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362. The DOL denied these applications, and the employees subsequently appealed to the Court of International Trade. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Finding error in the DOL's determination, the Court of International Trade remanded the case back to the DOL for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Notably, the Court of International Trade retained jurisdiction over the matter during remand. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The employees eventually obtained the benefits they sought, after which they applied for attorney's fees under EAJA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1363.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing whether the remand to the DOL constituted relief on the merits, we distinguished remands to administrative agencies from remands contained entirely within the federal court system. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1364-65. We relied on two Supreme Court cases in doing so: <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Hudson</span>, 490 U.S. 877 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Shalala v. Schaefer</span>, 509 U.S. 292 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summarizing <span class="Italic">Hudson</span>, we explained that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a district court ordered a remand to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for reconsideration of a Social Security benefits claim, and retained jurisdiction. On remand the claimant was successful in obtaining benefits. The Supreme Court held that that claimant was a prevailing party because it succeeded before the agency after the remand. The Court explained that because there would be no final judgment until the case was decided on remand "for purposes of EAJA," the claimant's status as "prevailing party" was "dependent on the successful completion of the remand proceedings before the Secretary. Moreover, the remanding court continues to retain jurisdiction over the action within the meaning of EAJA and may exercise that jurisdiction to determine if its legal instructions on remand have been followed by the Secretary." The Court therefore held that "where administrative proceedings are intimately tied to the resolution of judicial action and necessary to the attainment of the results Congress sought to promote by providing for fees, they should be considered part and parcel of the action for which fees may be awarded."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1365-66 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hudson</span>, 490 U.S. at 877-88 (internal citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summarizing <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span>, we explained that the case involved the question of</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">when a "final judgment" had been entered for the purposes of starting EAJA's 30-day time period for filing an attorneys' fees application. The district court had remanded the case for reconsideration by the Secretary of Health and Human Services but had not retained jurisdiction. When the district court retains jurisdiction, the Supreme Court held, the time period begins after the district court dismisses. When it does not retain jurisdiction, the time period begins to run with the remand order itself. The Court emphasized that when a district court "revers[es] the Secretary's denial of benefits" and remands without retaining jurisdiction, the claimant is a "prevailing party" for the purposes of EAJA because "the plaintiff has succeeded on a[&#8197;] significant issue in litigation which achieved some of the benefit sought in bringing suit."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1366 (quoting <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span>, 509 U.S. at 298-99, 302 (1993) (internal citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Hudson</span> and <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span>, we formulated the following rule in <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where the plaintiff secures a remand requiring further agency proceedings because of alleged error by the agency, the plaintiff qualifies as a prevailing party (1) without regard to the outcome of the agency proceedings where there has been no retention of jurisdiction by the court, or (2) when successful in the remand proceedings where there has been a retention of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1366. As explained above, the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span> were successful on remand in a case where the remanding court retained jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362-63. Therefore, they qualified as "prevailing parties" under the second prong of the rule stated above. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1367.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first prong of the test articulated in <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span> was not directly applicable to the facts of that case. Thereafter, however, prong one was applied by our court in <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Nicholson</span>. 463 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Rader, J., dissenting). <span class="Italic">Kelly</span> involved a veteran diagnosed with two conditions: olivopontocerebellar atrophy ("OPCA") and ataxia. The Regional Office and the Board of Veterans' Appeals both denied the veteran's claim for benefits, but failed to consider the ataxia evidence before doing so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352. The veteran subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ("Veterans Court") and obtained a remand. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As we later explained, the Board of Veterans' Appeals erred because it violated a statutory obligation to consider the ataxia evidence before rejecting the veteran's service connection claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354-55.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After obtaining his remand, the veteran applied for attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352. Prong one of the <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span> rule was at issue because the Veterans Court did not retain jurisdiction over the remand. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1353. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of the veteran's case was irrelevant in the attorney's fees analysis; the focus was solely on whether agency error caused the remand. We concluded that the VA's failure to consider the ataxia evidence was a sufficient agency error to qualify the veteran for prevailing party status under EAJA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1355.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4618"></span>Notably, our precedent does not characterize every agency remand as a grant of relief on the merits under <span class="Italic">Former Employees.</span> Indeed, we have held that remands not rooted in agency error do not result in prevailing party status. Such remands include: a remand to address the impact of a newly-enacted statute on a case, <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Principi</span>, 336 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2003); a remand to consider newly acquired evidence, <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354; and a remand where the Board of Veterans' Appeals arguably misapplies a federal regulation but where the Veterans Court does not "explicitly or implicitly predicate[&#8197;]" the remand order on this alleged misapplication. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Nicholson</span>, 475 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Gurley v. Peake</span>, 528 F.3d 1322, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2008), a veteran obtained a remand because the Board of Veterans' Appeals failed to properly consider the merits of three claims at once. Instead, the Board of Veterans' Appeals ruled on the merits of one claim while declining to address the other two. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We found that the "sole basis" for this remand was "judicial economy" rather than agency error and concluded that "[u]nder these circumstances, [the veteran] cannot be considered a 'prevailing party' under EAJA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1328.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present matter, since we did not retain jurisdiction over our remand of Mr. Ward's case to the Merit Systems Protection Board, prong one of the <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span> rule applies. <span class="Italic">See Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1366. Thus, the outcome of the remand is inconsequential, and we focus our analysis solely on whether agency error caused the remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ward's remand was clearly caused by administrative error. As we explained in our previous opinion, the Merit Systems Protection Board failed to analyze the deciding official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications under the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> framework, an analysis intended to determine whether Mr. Ward's due process rights were violated. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279. Next, the Board failed to properly address a procedural error committed by the Agency. Specifically, the Agency erred by considering instances of misconduct not mentioned in the Notice of Proposed Removal when determining Mr. Ward's penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1281. The Board then erred by concluding that it could remedy the Agency's error by performing an independent analysis under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, the Board was required to perform a harmless error analysis to determine whether the Agency's procedural error required reversal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Because these administrative errors resulted in Mr. Ward's remand, we conclude that Mr. Ward qualifies as a prevailing party under EAJA. <span class="Italic">See Kelly</span>, 463 F.3d at 1353; <span class="Italic">Former Employees</span>, 336 F.3d at 1366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mr. Ward is a "prevailing party" under EAJA and is therefore entitled to the attorney's fees incurred during his Federal Circuit appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prevailing party status through a remand was achieved in <span class="Italic">Dover v. McDonald</span>, 818 F.3d 1316. 1318-20 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EAJA provides that "a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses...incurred by that party in any civil action...unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A). To determine whether an appellant is the "prevailing party," "the correct legal standard...is [that] party must receive 'at least some relief on the merits of his claim.'" <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Principi</span>, 336 F.3d 1351, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Res</span>., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001)). Relief on the merits requires a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604; <span class="Italic">see also Former Emps. of Motorola Ceramic Prods. v. United States</span>, 336 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("[T]o be a prevailing party, one must receive at least some relief on the merits, which alters the legal relationship of the parties." (internal quotations and citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Traditional examples of relief on the merits include judgments on the merits and consent decrees. <span class="Italic">See Vaughn</span>, 336 F.3d at 1357; <span class="Italic">see also Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist</span>., 489 U.S. 782 (1989). In contrast, "[m]inimal relief resembling an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim or a reversal of a directed verdict will not satisfy the statutory requirements to achieve prevailing party status." <span class="Italic">Vaughn</span>, 336 F.3d at 1357 (internal quotations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Hewitt v. Helms</span>, 482 U.S. 755 (1987); <span class="Italic">Hanrahan v. Hampton</span>, 446 U.S. 754 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Remand for further proceedings by a lower civil court in the federal system is not typically considered relief on the merits. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hewitt</span>, 482 U.S. at 762; <span class="Italic">Hanrahan</span>, 446 U.S. at 758-59. We have held, however, that remand to an administrative agency is different. <span class="Italic">See Motorola</span>, 336 F.3d at 1365. An appeal of an agency decision "is treated as a separate proceeding from the administrative proceeding, and a remand may [therefore] constitute the securing of relief on the merits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consequently, we have held that where the remanding court has not retained jurisdiction, a remand to an administrative agency is relief on the merits if the remand was necessitated by agency error, and the remand calls for further agency proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the parties agree that the remand was necessitated by agency error, and the remanding court did not retain jurisdiction. The disputed issue is only whether the remand calls for further agency proceedings within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Motorola</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA argues that the requirements of <span class="Italic">Motorola</span> are not met because--notwithstanding the remand order's call for "further proceedings"--the order as a whole suggested that those proceedings should be limited to dismissal. The VA relies on <span class="Italic">Halpern</span>, in which we held that a remand instructing the agency to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction does not call for further agency proceedings within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Motorola</span>. <span class="Italic">Halpern</span>, 384 F.3d at 1306. We disagree that <span class="Italic">Halpern</span> dictates the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Halpern</span> is distinguishable from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Halpern</span> we found "nothing in the Veterans' Court's disposition of this case that requires further agency proceedings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In contrast, the remand order here explicitly calls "for further proceedings." The order further instructs the Board that it must permit Mrs. Dover "to submit additional evidence and argument in support of her claim," and that it is "required to consider any such evidence and argument." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On remand, the Board complied with these instructions by granting Mrs. Dover further proceedings on the merits. Because the remand order both contemplated and precipitated further agency proceedings on the merits, we conclude that Mrs. Dover was the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the VA's argument that Mrs. Dover was not the prevailing party simply because the remand opinion indicated that the Board should have dismissed Mrs. Dover's claim without prejudice. First, as noted above, the remand order called for further proceedings. Second, even if the remand order were understood as instructing the Board to dismiss the case without prejudice, that would not foreclose Mrs. Dover from being the prevailing party. In <span class="Italic">Motorola</span>, we held that if the remanding court does not retain jurisdiction, a remand for agency error makes the appellant the prevailing party "without regard to the outcome of the agency proceedings." <span class="Italic">Motorola</span>, 336 F.3d at 1366. Because the ultimate merits determination is irrelevant, <span class="Italic">Halpern</span> requires only that the remand leave the <span class="Italic">possibility</span> of attaining a favorable merits determination through further agency proceedings. In <span class="Italic">Halpern</span>, that possibility was foreclosed because the Veterans Court vacated on jurisdictional grounds. <span class="Italic">See Halpern</span>, 384 F.3d at 1306. In this case, the possibility of a favorable merits determination was not foreclosed because the Veterans Court vacated on procedural grounds. The remand simply cleared a procedural hurdle (i.e., an adverse ruling on the merits with prejudice) so that Mrs. Dover could pursue additional proceedings on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Dover was the prevailing party because the remand she won was necessitated by agency error, the remand called for--and Mrs. Dover received--further agency proceedings, and the Veterans Court did not retain jurisdiction. The Veterans Court's determination the Mrs. Dover is not entitled to attorney's fees under the EAJA as a prevailing party is therefore reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again considering the relation between a remand and prevailing party status under EAJA, <span class="Italic">Robinson v. O'Rourke</span>, 891 F.3d 976, 980-85 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (Judge Newman concurring in part and dissenting in part), on appeal from the Court of Veterans Claims, explained as to a remand to VA from the lower court that prevailing party status may result through a remand based on administrative error (although that did not avail Mr. Robinson):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Robinson Is Not a Prevailing Party</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only substantive issue on appeal is whether the Veterans Court's remand conferred prevailing-party status on Robinson. That issue presents a question of law that we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Nicholson</span>, 475 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Robinson, as the EAJA applicant, carries the burden of proving he is a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated below, Robinson has not satisfied his burden, as he has not shown that the court's remand was predicated on administrative error or that it materially altered the legal relationship of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Legal Principles</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EAJA is a fee-shifting statute that allows a party who prevails in a civil action brought by or against the government to recover attorney fees and costs. The statute provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses[&#8197;]...incurred by that party in any civil action...unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A). The "essential objective" of the EAJA is to remove deterrents "from seeking review of, or defending against, unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved." <span class="Italic">Kelly</span>, 463 F.3d at 1353 (internal quotation marks omitted). This objective is particularly salient in the veterans context, "which is intended to be uniquely pro-claimant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By its terms, the statute applies only to a "prevailing party." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A). In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), the <span id="Page_4619"></span>Supreme Court held, in the context of interpreting a fee-shifting provision in the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, that a prevailing party is one who receives "at least some relief on the merits of his claim." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 603 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 475 F.3d at 1363 ("A party prevails in a civil action if he receives 'at least some relief on the merits of his claim.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 603-04)). The Court noted, however, that not every type or quantum of relief will suffice. Instead, the Court stated that the relief requires a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">Former Emps. of Motorola Ceramic Prods. v. United States</span>, 336 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Thus, the Court noted that, while judgments on the merits and consent decrees generally confer prevailing-party status, minimal relief resembling an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim generally does not. <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604-05; <span class="Italic">Dover v. McDonald</span>, 818 F.3d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the rule set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, we have held that remand to an administrative agency for further proceedings can provide the requisite relief required to confer prevailing-party status, but only if the remand is predicated--either explicitly or implicitly--on administrative error.[2] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ward v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 672 F.3d 1294, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("[W]e have held that remands not rooted in agency error do not result in prevailing party status."); <span class="Italic">Gurley</span>, 528 F.3d at 1327 ("[t]he remand must be based on an administrative error in order for the appellant to qualify as a prevailing party."); <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 475 F.3d at 1364 ("In order for Davis to prevail on this argument, we must conclude that the Remand Order was either explicitly or implicitly predicated on administrative error."); <span class="Italic">Eady v. Shinseki</span>, 321 Fed. Appx. 971, 974 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("In order for the party to be considered 'prevailing,' the remand order must have been either explicitly or implicitly predicated on administrative error." (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although remand to a federal district court for further proceedings is not typically considered relief on the merits, remand to an administrative agency is unique because "[a]n appeal of an agency decision is treated as a separate proceeding from the administrative proceeding" itself. <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 818 F.3d at 1319 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have stated, moreover, that, "[w]here there has been a remand to an administrative agency <span class="Italic">without</span> a judicial finding of administrative error or a concession of such error by the agency, the default rule is that the remand is <span class="Italic">not</span> based on administrative error for EAJA purposes." <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 475 F.3d at 1366 (emphases added). "This default rule places the burden on the EAJA applicant to prove, based on the record, that the remand had to have been predicated on administrative error even though the remand order does not say so." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While briefing in this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court issued a decision clarifying <span class="Italic">Buckhannon's</span> rule. In <span class="Italic">CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 136 S. Ct. 1642 (2016), the Court addressed a fee-shifting provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and held that "a defendant need not obtain a favorable judgment on the merits in order to be a 'prevailing party.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1651. The Court reiterated that the "touchstone" of the prevailing-party inquiry is whether there has been a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1646 (internal quotation marks omitted). This alteration, the Court stated, "must be marked by 'judicial <span class="Italic">imprimatur</span>.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 605). in so holding, the Court noted that a defendant "may prevail even if the court's final judgment rejects the plaintiff's claim for a nonmerits reason" because the defendant fulfills its "primary objective whenever the plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court's decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1651.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have not yet applied <span class="Italic">CRST's</span> guidance in the EAJA context, we have applied that guidance in the patent context. In <span class="Italic">Raniere v. Microsoft Corp</span>., 887 F.3d 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2018), we held that a district court's dismissal of the patentee's infringement suit, with prejudice, for lack of standing conferred prevailing-party status on the defendants under 35 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 285. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1303-09. in that context, we explained that, although a judgment on the merits is <span class="Italic">sufficient</span> to confer prevailing-party status, it is not <span class="Italic">necessary</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1306-07 (citing <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, 136 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We noted, moreover, that the phrase "prevailing party" in the Patent Act's fee-shifting provision should be interpreted consistently with the Court's interpretation in <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, notwithstanding that the Court was interpreting a different statute in that case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1305. indeed, the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">CRST</span> that "Congress has included the term 'prevailing party' in various fee-shifting statutes, and it has been the Court's approach to interpret the term in a consistent manner" across those statutes. <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, 136 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither <span class="Italic">CRST</span> nor <span class="Italic">Raniere</span>, however, dealt with remand to an agency as a basis for finding prevailing-party status, as here. Both cases, moreover, involved <span class="Italic">defendants</span>--rather than plaintiffs--who purported to have prevailed. In <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, the Court noted the asymmetry in the parties' litigation objectives, which affects the showing that each party must make to achieve prevailing-party status. Whereas a plaintiff "seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties" and prevails only when it effects such an alteration in the first instance, the defendant merely "seeks to prevent this alteration" and therefore prevails "whenever the plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court's decision." <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, 136 S. Ct. at 1651.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, it is unclear whether, in the wake of <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, we must reconsider or clarify our precedent requiring administrative error in cases of remand for further agency proceedings. We need not resolve that issue here, however.[3] Robinson is not a prevailing party under either our precedent or the guidance set forth in <span class="Italic">CRST</span>. As explained in more detail below, the Veterans Court's decision in this case was not predicated on administrative error, and it likewise did not materially alter the legal relationship of the parties as contemplated by <span class="Italic">CRST</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note, however, that our "administrative error" precedent likely is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">CRST</span>. Even under our current precedent, prevailing-party status may be conferred on a claimant who has secured remand where the agency erred on procedural or jurisdictional grounds, and not just substantive grounds. <span class="Italic">See Dover</span>, 818 F.3d at 1319-20 (finding that the claimant was a prevailing party where "the Veterans Court vacated on procedural grounds" and remanded to "clear[&#8197;] a procedural hurdle (i.e., an adverse ruling on the merits with prejudice) so that [she] could pursue additional proceedings on the merits"); <span class="Italic">see also Wood</span>, 837 F.3d at 971-75 (finding plaintiffs to be prevailing parties based on remand to agency predicated on a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, and plaintiffs challenged the agency determination on that ground).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Veterans Court's Remand Decision Is Not Predicated on Administrative Error</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remand at issue was not predicated on administrative error. The Veterans Court did not address the merits of Robinson's appeal, much less identify any error committed by the Board below. Nor could it, as Robinson did not argue that he was entitled to an earlier effective date before the Board. Instead, the Veterans Court considered Robinson's belated argument, and remanded for the Board to make factual findings related to that issue in the first instance. In other words, the remand required the Board to consider an argument that it could not have considered previously, through no fault of its own.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the Veterans Court "set aside" the Board's rating decision does not compel a different conclusion. This "set aside" language cannot fairly be read to suggest that the court passed judgment on the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See Eady</span>, 321 Fed. Appx. at 975 (rejecting the argument that, "because the Veterans Court characterized the Board's decision as 'erroneous,' the court's remand order was necessarily predicated on the recognition of agency error"). Instead, it reflects the fact that vacatur was required to allow the Board to make factual findings that the Veterans Court, as an appellate tribunal, could not itself make in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See Deloach v. Shinseki</span>, 704 F.3d 1370, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, as part of its clear error review, must <span class="Italic">review</span> the Board's weighing of the evidence; it may not weigh any evidence itself. As we have recognized, the statute prohibits the court from making factual findings in the first instance." (citing <span class="Italic">Andre v. Principi</span>, 301 F.3d 1354, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor could the Veterans Court's remand decision be read to <span class="Italic">implicitly</span> identify error by the Board. As a general matter, "the Veterans Court has authority to remand cases to the Board for further proceedings for further consideration of legal issues or for clarification of facts underlying a legal issue," and administrative error therefore cannot be inferred from remand, generally. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 475 F.3d at 1364. Further, in concluding that remand was appropriate here, the Veterans Court decided not to apply issue exhaustion, which, we have emphasized, "is generally a matter of judicial discretion." <span class="Italic">Bozeman v. McDonald</span>, 814 F.3d 1354, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">Maggitt</span>, 202 F.3d at 1377 ("While the Veterans Court may hear legal arguments raised for the first time with regard to a claim that is properly before the court, it is not compelled to do so in every instance."). And, as the Veterans Court noted, that discretion involves "balancing the <span id="Page_4620"></span>competing interests at stake," including the interest in "promoting judicial efficiency." <span class="Italic">Remand Decision</span>, 2015 WL 2448037, at *2. A remand order based on the interest of judicial economy is not a remand predicated on agency error. <span class="Italic">Gurley</span>, 528 F.3d at 1328; <span class="Italic">Eady</span>, 321 Fed. Appx. at 975.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> is instructive. There, the Veterans Court vacated the Board's decision and remanded for the Board to make factual findings related to a VA regulation that it had previously overlooked. 475 F.3d at 1362. The Veterans Court thereafter denied the veteran's fee application, holding that the veteran was not a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1363. We affirmed, ruling that the veteran "failed to prove that the remand was based on administrative agency error," in part because the remand merely afforded the veteran the opportunity to litigate again, and "in no way materially altered his legal relationship with the VA as to the claimed...benefits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366. We noted that the Veteran Court's remand decision did "not state that the remand [was] predicated on agency error," and similarly did "not state that the Board had failed to apply or had improperly applied" the regulation in its underlying merits decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1364. Instead, the remand decision permitted additional fact-finding "and allow[ed] the parties to submit additional evidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the Veterans Court did not make a finding of administrative error, nor can such error fairly be inferred from the court's exercise of its discretion in remanding to the Board to consider Robinson's new legal argument. Instead, like in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the court merely allowed Robinson to submit additional evidence to the Board in support of its new argument. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1364; <span class="Italic">see also Vaughn v. Principi</span>, 336 F.3d 1351, 1355-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding that remand to consider new evidence does not confer prevailing-party status); <span class="Italic">Yates v. Nicholson</span>, 140 Fed. Appx. 954, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (granting motion for summary affirmance of a Veterans Court decision finding that the veteran was not a prevailing party, where the court exercised its discretion to allow the veteran "the opportunity to raise a new argument before the Board"); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Principi</span>, 17 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2003) ("Because the Court found no error on this point but, rather, remanded the matter for the Board to consider the issue raised for the first time on appeal, such a...remand does not, by itself, confer prevailing-party status on the appellant.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Robinson nevertheless argues that the Veterans Court implicitly recognized administrative error based on the Board's failure to consider and address in its decision all potentially applicable provisions of law and regulation. In particular, Robinson argues that, by statute, the effective date of an award must be "fixed in accordance with the facts found." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5110(a). Further, by regulation and agency directive, patients "have a right to receive[&#8197;]...prompt and appropriate treatment for any physical or emotional disability." 38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.33(a)(2); Veterans Health Administration Directive 2006-041 (June 27, 2006). Robinson appears to argue from these provisions that the Board should have inferred from the available facts that the VA, rather than Robinson, caused the fourteen-month delay and should have <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determined that the effective date of Robinson's disability rating was February 2006 rather than April 2007. Having failed to do that, Robinson asserts, the Board did not base its decision "upon consideration of all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law and regulation," as required by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7104(a). Robinson argues that the Veterans Court implicitly recognized this failure. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision was based on the available medical evidence in the record--namely, the April 2007 test results, which demonstrated that Robinson's disability had worsened. And, the only relevant dispute before the Board with respect to Robinson's rating was whether he was entitled to a rating "in excess of 60 percent for the period from April 2, 2007, forward." The Board resolved the issue regarding the <span class="Italic">magnitude</span> of the rating, but had no need to address the underlying <span class="Italic">date</span> for that rating. Thus, the Veterans Court would have had no basis to find that the Board's decision was not rooted in "all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law and regulation," as required by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case, therefore, is unlike the cases on which the dissent and Robinson rely. In <span class="Italic">Kelly</span>, for example, the Board received medical information regarding two separate diagnoses. 463 F.3d at 1353. The Board considered only one of those diagnoses, however, in denying the veteran's service connection claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Veterans Court remanded the case for the Board to consider the second diagnosis, and we concluded that the remand was based on administrative error because the Board had not considered all evidence and material of record before making its decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1354. We noted that the veteran did not bring separate claims for his two diagnoses, but rather brought a single service connection claim that was supported by both diagnoses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1353. Here, by contrast, the effective date issue was not one that Robinson raised before the Board. The Board, therefore, did not err because it considered all the evidence and the applicable laws and regulations when making its decision on the issues that were properly before it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Former Employees of Motorola Ceramic Products</span> and <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, the agencies <span class="Italic">conceded</span> error, and there could thus be no doubt that the remand decisions in those cases were predicated on such error. <span class="Italic">See Motorola</span>, 336 F.3d at 1362 (vacating finding that appellants were not prevailing parties where the government consented to remand to the Department of Labor, and "[t]he parties thus agreed that the Department had erred in its action on the applications"); <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 818 F.3d at 1319 ("Here, the parties agree that the remand was necessitated by agency error, and the remanding court did not retain jurisdiction.

The Court has "interpret[ed] the term ['prevailing party'] in a consistent manner" across "various fee-shifting statutes," <span class="Italic">id</span>., and we have thus applied its guidance correspondingly, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Robinson</span>, 891 F.3d at 980-82; <span class="Italic">Former Emps. of Motorola Ceramic Prods. v. United States</span>, 336 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most recently, the Supreme Court held that "a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant has prevailed" in a case involving the fee-shifting provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, 136 S. Ct. at 1646. We have recognized that the Court, in so holding, "noted the asymmetry in the parties' litigation objectives, which affects the showing that each party must make to achieve prevailing party status." <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 891 F.3d at 982 (citing <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, 136 S. Ct. at 1651). The Court explained that while a plaintiff "seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties" and must achieve such an alteration to prevail, the defendant merely "seeks to prevent this alteration" and thus prevails "whenever the plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed." <span class="Italic">CRST</span>, 136 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the Supreme Court's pre-<span class="Italic">CRST</span> decisions in the context of court review of administrative agencies, we have held that to be a "prevailing party" a plaintiff "must 'receive at least some relief on the merits,' which 'alters the legal relationship of the parties.'" <span class="Italic">Motorola</span>, 336 F.3d at 1364 (internal citations and alterations omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 603, 605). In that context,[1] we have held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where the plaintiff secures a remand requiring further agency proceedings because of alleged error by the agency, the plaintiff qualifies as a prevailing party (1) without regard to the outcome of the agency proceedings where there has been no retention of jurisdiction by the court, or (2) when successful in the remand proceedings where there has been a retention of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Typically, "remands by the courts of appeals to district courts for further proceedings do not constitute relief on the merits or confer prevailing party status on the successful party." <span class="Italic">Gurley v. Peake</span>, 528 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2008). "Remands to administrative agencies are, however, different.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366. In the absence of "a judicial finding of administrative error or a concession of such error by the agency, the default rule is that the remand is not based on administrative error for EAJA purposes," and "the burden [is] on the EAJA applicant to prove...that the remand had to have been predicated on administrative error even though the remand order does not say so." <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the Veterans Court ordered further agency proceedings and did not retain jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Remand Decision</span>, the sole issue for our consideration is whether the remand was predicated either explicitly or implicitly on agency error. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 475 F.3d at 1364.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4621"></span>We agree with the government that the Veterans Court correctly concluded that Winters is not a prevailing party under EAJA. As Winters concedes, "the Veterans Court did not make an explicit finding of agency error." Winters instead relies on allegedly implicitly recognized error based principally on the Veterans Court's statement that "[g]iven the Secretary's concession that the Board did not comply with the procedures outlined in <span class="Italic">Ratliff</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Court agrees that the Board's July 24, 2014, adjudication of [Winters's] claims was premature." <span class="Italic">Remand Decision</span>, 2016 WL 1275079, at *8 (emphases added). However, neither the Secretary's "concession" with respect to Ratliff notice, nor the use of the word "premature" "clearly indicates that [Winters's] remand was based on agency error," and it was her burden to prove "that the remand had to have been predicated on administrative error even though the remand order does not say so." <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 475 F.3d at 1366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Winters is also not a prevailing party when we apply the Supreme Court's guidance in <span class="Italic">CRST</span>. <span class="Italic">CRST</span> did not change the requirement that a plaintiff must achieve a "material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties" in order to be considered a prevailing party. 136 S. Ct. at 1651; <span class="Italic">see also Robinson</span>, 891 F.3d at 985-86.

Winters has not demonstrated a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties based on this discretionary vacatur and remand predicated solely on the interest of judicial economy with no discussion directed to the merits of the claims. <span class="Italic">See Robinson</span>, 891 F.3d at 985 (applying <span class="Italic">CRST</span> and affirming determination that appellant was not a prevailing party under EAJA where "the remand reflects the Veterans Court's discretionary decision to allow a waived argument to proceed").

<p class="Body-Text">For the Board's view of what it takes to be an EAJA prevailing party, refer to <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Boyce</span>, 51 MSPR 295, 300-01 (1991) (determining that the EAJA may provide a basis for an award of counsel fees for services rendered before the Board in cases involving actions under 5 USC 7521 against ALJs who are unaffected by the APA tenure provision excluding coverage of other federal employees). Subsequent to and following the analysis of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. v. West Virginia DHHR</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/532/598.html">121 S. Ct. 1835</a> (2001), an agency's withdrawal of a complaint against an ALJ did not place the ALJ in the status of a prevailing party for an EAJA fee award, <span class="Italic">Krafsur v. SSA</span>, 122 MSPR 679, 684-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2015 MSPB 55 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that a different "prevailing party" standard should apply in Board proceedings under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 because, unlike adverse action appeals, such proceedings are initiated by the agency, and the administrative law judge is equivalent to a defendant rather than a plaintiff. However, the Board previously has applied the Buckhannon prevailing party standard to cases arising under the Board's original jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Salas,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 6 (2013) (applying the <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> standard in evaluating a request for attorney fees arising from a petition for disciplinary action initiated by the Office Special Counsel). In proceedings initiated by agencies, just as in proceedings initiated by employees, the Board has held that an employee is a prevailing party if he obtains an enforceable judgment against the agency or enforceable relief through a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in adjudicating requests for attorney fees under the EAJA where the government has initiated, and subsequently withdrawn, complaints against individuals, U.S. circuit courts have held that subsequent dismissals without prejudice did not render those individuals prevailing parties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Turner v. National Transportation Safety Board</span>, 608 F.3d 12, 13, 15-16 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (determining that two pilots were not prevailing parties under the EAJA where the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) voluntarily withdrew its complaints against them, and their appeal of the charges at issue in the complaints was dismissed without prejudice); <span class="Italic">United States v. Milner</span>, 583 F.3d 1174, 1196-97 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that defendants were not prevailing parties where the government sued them for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1311, and subsequently dismissed the claims without prejudice). While these decisions are not controlling authority, we find them persuasive. <span class="Italic">See Fairall v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, as he did below, the petitioner also argues that he was a prevailing party because the Board's prior nonprecedential final order modified the initial decision to dismiss the agency's complaint as withdrawn, rather than dismissed without prejudice. We disagree. Whether a party is a prevailing party depends on the relief ordered in the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). Here, the agency unilaterally and voluntarily initiated the withdrawal of the complaint. The prior nonprecedential final order did not direct the agency to take any action, and was not akin to a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree. <span class="Italic">See Buckhannon,</span> 532 U.S. at 604; <span class="Italic">Baldwin,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 413, &#x00B6; 11.

R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) (when a court dismisses an action at a plaintiff's request, unless the dismissal order states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice). Therefore, our prior final order did not award the petitioner any relief on the merits, or materially alter the legal relationship between the parties, because it did not prohibit the agency from refiling a new complaint based on the same charges.[8] <span class="Italic">See RFR Industries, Inc. v. Century Steps, Inc.,</span> 477 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In contrast, a dismissal with prejudice terminates any claims that one party may have against the other based on the same set of operative facts, and may constitute a judicially sanctioned material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties sufficient to confer prevailing-party status. <span class="Italic">See Green Aviation Management Company, LLC v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 676 F.3d 200, 201, 204-05 (D.C.
