<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-50"><span class="space">a.</span> Regulation Applying Statute; Agency Interpretation of Regulation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As to interpretation by agencies of their own regulations, the Federal Circuit declared, <span class="Italic">Price v. Panetta</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120316127">674 F.3d 1335</a>, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (claim under National Security Personnel System):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless that interpretation is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation." <span class="Italic">Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997); <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co</span>., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945). That principle applies whether the regulation in question is ambiguous or simply silent on the issue in question. <span class="Italic">See White v. United States</span>, 543 F.3d 1330, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Moreover, an agency's interpretation of its regulations is entitled to that generous degree of deference even when that interpretation is offered in the very litigation in which the argument in favor of deference is made, as long as there is "no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered <span id="Page_5225"></span>judgment on the matter in question." <span class="Italic">Auer</span>, 519 U.S. at 462; <span class="Italic">Reizenstein v. Shinseki</span>, 583 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Abbott Labs. v. United States</span>, 573 F.3d 1327, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Gose v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 451 F.3d 831, 838 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("Legitimate agency interpretations may be made even during the very administrative determination that has become the subject of review. However, the interpretation must truly be one that had been applied by the agency, either prior to or, at the latest, during the exercise of its administrative powers in the present matter.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no reason to believe that the Defense Department's interpretation of its NSPS regulations is merely a "convenient litigating position" or a "<span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalization" in this case. <span class="Italic">See Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,</span> 131 S. Ct. 871, 881 (2011); <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp.</span>, 488 U.S. 204, 213 (1988). To the contrary, the record shows that the Department of Defense has treated the effective date of the bonus component of the performance-based payout in the same manner since the initiation of the NSPS program in 2004. The Departmental regulations that were in effect before they were revised in 2008 provided that "Performance-based payouts shall be effective the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1 of each year." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def. Civilian Personnel Manual</span>, DOD 1400.25-M, subch. 1930.9.4. In that form, the regulations unambiguously provided that the "first day of the first pay period" after the first of each year was the effective date for all performance-based payouts, whether in the form of salary increases or bonuses. Pursuant to the 2008 revisions to the NSPS statute, <span class="Italic">see</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 1106, 122 Stat. 3, 349, 356 (2007), the Defense Department repromulgated its regulations through notice-and-comment procedures. In the course of the revisions made to the regulations, the language of the effective date provision was amended to its current form, which continues to provide that employees must be employed on the effective date of the payout to receive a performance-based payout but defines the "effective date" only for increases in salary. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.342(g)(6) &#x0026; (7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the regulatory record, it is clear that, despite the omission of reference to the effective date for bonus payments, the new regulations were intended to codify and continue the previous practice rather than to alter it. The new regulations largely tracked the previous version, and the Department identified those areas in which changes were intended. Those specified modifications did not include any reference to altering the effective date of bonuses by separating salary increases from bonuses for purposes of determining the date of vesting. <span class="Italic">See Proposed Rules</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. 29,882, 29,890 (May 22, 2008). During the notice-and-comment process, a commenter suggested that an NSPS employee "who earns a bonus for the performance year but retires before the end of the calendar year should still be able to receive a bonus payment." <span class="Italic">Final Rule</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. 56,344, 56,372 (Sept. 26, 2008). The Department of Defense rejected that suggestion, explaining that the regulation "clearly states that an employee who is no longer covered by NSPS on the effective date of the payout is not entitled to a performance-based payout." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While that response did not specifically identify the effective date of the bonus component of the payout, it rejected the underlying rationale of Mr. Price's argument--that an employee who is covered by the NSPS during the appraisal period should be entitled to the bonus earned during that period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative record thus shows that the interpretation of the regulation advanced by the government in this case is consistent with the position taken by the Department of Defense as to the effective date issue since the Department first promulgated regulations implementing the NSPS. In short, this is a case in which "the agency's course of action indicates that the interpretation of its own regulations reflects its considered views." <span class="Italic">Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke</span>, 551 U.S. 158, 171 (2007). The Department's interpretation, which is not "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation," <span class="Italic">Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala</span>, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994), is therefore entitled to deference. Because Mr. Price has not pointed to any statutory or regulatory language that is contrary to the Department's interpretation of the regulatory rule, we agree with the district court that the Department's interpretation governs this case and requires that Mr. Price's claim be rejected.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding OPM's regulations, there are several factors encouraging us to grant minimal deference to the agency's interpretation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the agency here had no chance to develop a consistent, established pattern of interpretation.... &#8197;Moreover, though the regulations are complicated, even frustrating, they are neither highly technical nor call upon any special expertise beyond experience in interpretation of bureaucratese formulation of the English language. Hence, we trust that we are competent to review critically interpretations attached by the OPM to the language of the regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, it appears that the OPM has selected an interpretation giving its regulations a "curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity and study of an acute and powerful intellect would discover." We can find an interpretation, we believe, which strains the applicable regulations less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, and finally, we note a significant amendment of the wording of the final regulations.... &#8197;We are not compelled to defer to such interpretation, designed, no doubt, to fill a gap perceived in the original before the amending regulation was in place.</p>

Jenkins</span>, 485 U.S. 415, 430 (1988) ("[W]hen it is the Secretary's regulation that we are construing, and when there is no claim in this Court that the regulation violates any constitutional or statutory mandate, we are properly hesitant to substitute an alternative reading for the Secretary's <span class="Italic">unless</span> that alternative reading is compelled by the regulation's plain language or by <span class="Italic">other indications of the Secretary's intent at the time of the regulation's promulgation</span>.")

However, the interpretation must truly be one that had been applied by the agency, either prior to or, at the latest, during the exercise of its administrative powers in the present matter. An "interpretation" is therefore not a position advanced by the agency for the first time before the Board or in a court of review. Such an "interpretation" is then no more than a litigation position to which no deference is due. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.

(citing <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span> 332 U.S. 194 (1947))). Nonetheless, the standard for deference is often easily met. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Auer</span>, 519 U.S. at 462 (finding that "[t]here is simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation [offered by an agency in a legal brief] does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the interpretation either has to be that of the Secretary or properly imputed to him in some way. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas Jefferson Univ.</span>, 512 U.S. at 517 (implying that deference might be improper if the Secretary's "fiscal intermediary" had displayed a contrary understanding of the regulation and "if petitioner could show that such [action] was approved by--or even brought to the attention of--the Secretary or her designate at the time").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C. Analysis</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that it adjudicated Gose's dismissal by interpreting "public place" to mean "a place where postal customers are located" and that because this interpretation is plausible, it is entitled to deference. As we explained above, in order to merit Seminole Rock deference, the agency's interpretation (1) must have been directed to regulatory language that is unclear; (2) must have been actually applied in the present agency action; and (3) must not be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. In addition, we consider the consistency <span class="Italic">vel non</span> with which the agency has applied that interpretation. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> Part II.B. The agency's interpretation clearly passes the first prong of the tripartite test, as the regulation is vague as to the scope of the phrase "in a public place." It fails the second two prongs for the reasons discussed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning first to the "actual application" prong, we observe that the salient question is whether the agency actually based its decision to remove Gose on the interpretation of "public place" as anywhere that a Postal Service customer can be found. We must ensure that the agency is not now masquerading a <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalization as a then-existing "interpretation." <span class="Italic">See Burlington Truck Lines</span>, 371 U.S. at 168-69 (declining to defer to "appellate counsel's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalizations for agency action"). The problem here is that the agency asks us to accept the after-the-fact testimony before the Board of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the deciding official as proof that it had actually decided the Gose matter by applying a particular construction of the regulation. Clearly, an agency's mere application of law to facts in a particular action cannot be read to establish an implicit "agency interpretation" of the regulation. Such a rule would vitiate the requirement that agency interpretations be legitimate <span class="Italic">precursors</span> to an application of law to fact, rather than <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalizations, by creating <span class="Italic">de facto</span> <span class="Italic">per se</span> deference in every case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the question becomes whether it was arbitrary and capricious for the Board to conclude, based on the evidence before it, that the deciding official had in fact applied a particular "interpretation" of the regulation in his decision, even though his decision letter made absolutely no mention of any such interpretation. We hold that it was. On appeal to the MSPB, however, the AJ improperly overlooked this shortcoming, and relied principally on testimony by the deciding official (Ashworth) that to the Postal Service "any place is a public place that we serve.... &#8197;[E]very citizen is a customer of ours." The AJ then deferred to the agency's interpretation of "public place," stating in his initial decision that he "agree[d] with the testimony of Messrs. O'Reilly [the local customer service manager] and Ashworth [postmaster] ," that "a public place is anywhere that Postal Service customers can be found." The AJ further implied that this interpretation was consistent with "[t]he intent of the Postal Service policy to prevent its uniformed employees from drinking intoxicating beverages in public view." There was, however, no evidence before the Board to suggest the intent of the agency in promulgating the regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ erred in deferring to the agency's interpretation. Where a letter of removal is silent about the agency's interpretation of its regulation, <span id="Page_5228"></span>the existence and application of such an interpretation cannot be established principally by the after-the-fact testimony of agency officials regarding what they had apparently thought but failed to articulate at the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, according to <span class="Italic">Seminole Rock</span>, no deference is due to an agency interpretation of a reference that is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation." 325 U.S. at 414. The agency asks us to read ELM &#x00A7; 661.54 (prohibiting "drink[ing] intoxicating beverages in a public place while in uniform") and to adopt as our definition of "public place" their proffered interpretation--namely, "anywhere that Postal Service customers can be found." We further note, in this regard, the hearing testimony of local Postmaster Ashworth, who stated that to the Postal Service "any place is a public place that we serve.... &#8197;<span class="Italic">[E]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">very citizen is a customer</span> of ours." (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because, according to the Postal Service, a public place exists wherever there is a postal customer, and because by the agency's own account, "every citizen is [its] customer," we reach the logical conclusion that, in the agency's view, a public place exists wherever there is a citizen. This definition would classify as "public places" even employees' private homes, at least to the extent that the employee is not alone there. In short, the problem with this interpretation is that it effectively reads language out of the regulation. If the agency had wished to promulgate a regulation that prohibited drinking in uniform while "in the presence of others," it might have done so. However, it did not. Instead, it promulgated a regulation that specifically forbade such activity only "in a <span class="Italic">public</span> place." (emphasis added). An agency interpretation that effectively eviscerates regulatory language is <span class="Italic">per se</span> inconsistent with the regulation and may be accorded no deference.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Litigation-oriented regulatory interpretation by an agency was deemed unworthy of deference, <span class="Italic">Feuer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the posting is not an interpretation of the regulation. Although the regulation is cited in the vacancy announcement, there is no citation to the regulation in the section on qualifications, and the regulation has nothing to do with the qualifications or experience level required for the position--the subject of the vacancy announcement's requirement. Therefore, the question is whether deference is due to an agency's interpretation of an agency document that is not a regulation, an issue as to which there is little authority. Even assuming <span class="Italic">Auer</span>-like deference [<span class="Italic">Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452 (1997)] is owed in some circumstances to such interpretations, we think it is not owed here. First, no deference is due when the agency's interpretation does not reflect a "fair and considered judgment." <span class="Italic">Kisor v. Wilkie</span>, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2417 (2019) (quoting <span class="Italic">Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp</span>., 567 U.S. 142, 155 (2012)).

OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 675, 674-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-20 (2004), differentiated regulations that are necessary (and those that are not necessary) to fill in statutory gaps, and regulatory guidance that does not rise to the level of a regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM argues that the Board "should defer to [its] implementing regulations unless they are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the act in question," and it cites <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984), for the proposition that, "where Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, a reviewing forum should not simply impose its own construction of a statute, particularly where the administration of a congressionally created program necessarily requires an administrative agency to formulate policy and make rules to fill implicit and explicit gaps."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A.</span>, 467 U.S. at 843-44, that, when Congress "explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there [was] an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation," and "legislative regulations" filling the gap were to be "given controlling weight unless they [were] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." It also indicated that, even when the legislative delegation was implicit, a court was not free to substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 844. The Court in <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, however, was considering the effect of "legislative regulations," i.e., regulations that were the product of formal, "notice and comment" rulemaking proceedings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 840-41, 853-59.

Specifically, it has "made clear that agency personnel policies embodied in informal sources such as handbooks and directives... do not ordinarily merit <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we see no basis for finding that Congress "explicitly left a gap" with respect to the crediting of service such as that at issue here, or that it otherwise expressly delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations on that particular subject. More important, the only formally promulgated rule or regulation OPM has cited in support of its position is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.703(b), in which full-time and part-time service are defined. As we have indicated above, those definitions do not support the position OPM has taken here. The only general guidance OPM has issued on the matter at issue here appears to be Retirement and Insurance Letter (RIL) 2002-21, issued on October 2, 2002, which appears to be an internal letter OPM has issued to its employees, providing guidance on the crediting of service for retirement purposes. Such a document clearly is not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">See Roman v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 297 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (court referred to OPM's <span class="Italic">CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices</span> as "an internal handbook" and indicated that an agency's reliance on such a document was "not ordinarily entitled to the same weight as its reliance on a regulation that was promulgated pursuant to statutory authority and following formal notice and comment proceedings"). Instead, it is accorded only "a lesser degree of deference 'proportional to its "power to persuade,"' depending on such factors as its thoroughness, logic, expertness, and fit with prior interpretations." <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span>, 336 F.3d at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5229"></span>RIL 2002-21 refers to employees who have been receiving OWCP benefits, who are returned to work on a schedule designated as full-time, but who in fact "work on a part-time schedule" that is "gradually increased[d] ... to full-time." According to the RIL, OPM "generally allows this 'rehabilitation' time to be credited as full-time <span class="Italic">if the employees are brought back under a full-time work schedule and are working a full-time schedule within a reasonable period of time after returning to work.</span>" (emphasis added). We have indicated above that the appellant's work schedule was not increased to full-time and that the appellant in fact never worked more than 4 hours a day. Under RIL 2002-21, therefore, the appellant's service would not appear to be creditable as full-time service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the RIL provides only a very brief explanation of the reasoning on which its instructions are based. It acknowledges that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), employees who are on leave without pay while receiving OWCP benefits "are not limited to the six-month restriction on leave without pay." It then provides that "the law does not state that employees get full service credit just for being on OWCP"; and it concludes that, "[s]ince the employee is employed and is actually working a part-time schedule, he/she is not on LWOP and the LWOP credit for service cited in Title 5... is not relevant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not regard this explanation as persuasive. Section 8332(f) of Title 5, U.S.C., provides full service credit for time during which an employee is receiving OWCP benefits, and we see nothing in that provision or elsewhere that indicates that the fact that the employee is able to work to some extent during this time makes him ineligible for that credit. The RIL also includes no explanation at all of the "rehabilitation period" exception to the general rule it described; no reasons for its instructions that the exception applies only if the employee is "working a full-time schedule within a reasonable period of time after returning to work"; and--other than the brief reference to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) that is mentioned above--no citation of any authority for its position on the subject.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that RIL 2002-21 is entitled to little weight.[6] Moreover, as noted previously, the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) supports the appellant's position that an employee who returns to duty in his full-time position following a compensable injury is entitled to full credit for his service in that position, even if he is receiving OWCP benefits for the hours exceeding those he is able to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We also note that the RIL was not issued until fairly recently, i.e., the month after the appellant retired.

Comity is the discretionary practice of forums to recognize each other's acts. BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 303 (9th ed. 2009); <span class="Italic">see Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co</span>., 341 U.S. 246, 254 (1951) (observing that it is proper for the court to refer to an administrative forum a matter that falls within its authority both as a matter of comity and to avoid conflict). Based on policy considerations of comity and cooperation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a coequal tribunal, the Board has previously exercised its discretion to defer to EEOC's procedural determinations regarding whether an appellant made a valid election between the Board and equal employment opportunity processes. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Burgos v. Department of Defense</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 10 (1998) (observing that the Board and EEOC are coequal in the mixed-case process); <span class="Italic">cf. Cloutier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 411, &#x00B6; 6 (2001) (deferring to the employing agency's determination that a discrimination complaint was untimely). This deference is based on the recognition of EEOC's major responsibility for the equal employment opportunity process and a desire not to frustrate EEOC's goals. <span class="Italic">Dawson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 194, 197 (1990). Similarly, we find here that OGE is primarily responsible for oversight of the ethical standards of federal employees. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Nichols</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 445, 455 (1988) (recognizing that OGE is the agency primarily responsible for developing rules and regulations pertaining to conflicts of interest and standards of conduct). Our prior finding in <span class="Italic">Jonson I</span> is contrary to OGE's determination that its concurrence in the minimum fitness regulations was not required and could create confusion. Therefore, we find this situation one in which it is appropriate to defer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our ruling here, we reverse our prior finding in <span class="Italic">Jonson I</span> that section 1822(f)(2), and not section 1822(f)(4), of the RTCCA empowers FDIC to prescribe the conduct for which it removed the appellant. <span class="Italic">Jonson I</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 12. Section 1822(f)(2) requires FDIC to obtain OGE concurrence before prescribing regulations that supplement the ethics and conflict of interest rules and regulations issued by OGE. The declaration from OGE compared the minimum fitness regulations to OGE's own regulatory authority and concluded that the minimum fitness regulations did not require OGE's approval because they did not "modify or expand the government-wide Standards of Ethical Conduct for Executive Branch Employees, nor do they regulate an area reserved for supplemental agency regulations (such as: outside activity limitations, prior approval requirements and prohibited holding restrictions)." Therefore, we conclude that FDIC was not required to promulgate the minimum fitness regulations under section 1822(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with FDIC that our prior ruling incorrectly found that it lacks authority under section 1822(f)(4) to regulate employee conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 12-17; <span class="Italic">see Jonson I</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 12. In evaluating an agency's construction of a statute, we look first to congressional intent. <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 841-42 (1984). Absent clear congressional intent, as here, we next examine whether the agency was explicitly charged with filling in a gap left in the legislation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 843-44. Where, as here, we find that it was, the agency's regulations "are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 844. Express congressional authorization to an agency to engage in rulemaking, and the use of the notice and comment procedures in promulgating such rules, are significant indicators that <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Mayo Foundation for Medical Education &#x0026; Research v. United States</span>, 562 U.S. 44, 57-58 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The text of section 1822(f)(4) provides that FDIC may "prescribe regulations... for ensuring that any individual who is performing, directly or indirectly, any function on behalf of the Corporation meets the minimum standards of competence, experience, integrity and fitness." 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1822(f)(4)(A). No OGE approval is required for the subject regulations. Therefore, FDIC was charged with filling any gaps left in the statute with the minimum fitness regulations. In promulgating <span id="Page_5230"></span>the minimum fitness regulations, FDIC relied on section 1822(f)(4)(E), which requires that the minimum fitness regulations prohibit certain behaviors, including "a pattern or practice of defalcation regarding obligations to insured depository institutions." Minimum Standards of Fitness for Employment with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 61 Fed. Reg. 28,725, 28,726 (June 6, 1996). Further, before finalizing its regulations, FDIC sought notice and comment. Minimum Standards of Fitness for Employees with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 61 Fed. Reg. 5956 (Feb. 15, 1996). We find the agency's reliance on section 1822(f)(4) to be appropriate, and we give its regulations controlling weight.</p>
