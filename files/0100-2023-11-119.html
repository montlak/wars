<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-119"><span class="space">D.</span> WITHDRAWAL OF ALLEGATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once a complainant withdraws a claim in the precomplaint stage, she is not entitled to have it reinstated without sufficient cause. <span class="Italic">See Horn v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A24946 (2003); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960740 (1996). In the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> case, the complainant initiated precomplaint counseling on an allegation of sexual harassment against a coworker. While still in counseling, she was informed that the agency had issued a 14-day suspension to her coworker and withdrew her complaint. In upholding the agency's refusal to later reinstate the complaint, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has failed to provide an adequate justification for reinstating her informal complaint. We note in this regard that the record contains no persuasive evidence or argument that would indicate that she was unable to appreciate the significance of her October 2, 1995 withdrawal. On the contrary, the document indicates that appellant, by signing, fully understood that by withdrawing her informal complaint she was waiving her right to any further processing of her informal complaint. Although she subsequently maintained that she was "tricked" into withdrawing her informal complaint and was denied representation, a review of the record indicates that appellant did not provide any details or evidence to support her assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Due to the rather serious nature of appellant's allegations, it reasonable to conclude that she would not have withdrawn her informal complaint without a great deal of deliberation. Consequently, we find that appellant knowingly and voluntarily withdrew her informal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chung v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A21129 (2002), the Commission held that when a complainant withdraws from precomplaint counseling and later reinitiates counseling outside of the original 45-day time limit, the complaint is untimely and should be dismissed. A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Miles v. Government Printing Office</span>, 01A33018 (2003), where the complainant withdrew her allegations of discrimination regarding nonselection during precomplaint counseling and then reinitiated counselor contact outside the 45-day time limit. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Barrios v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A34748 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">Diminished capacity due to depression may not be sufficient to establish that the withdrawal of an precomplaint complaint was not knowing and voluntary. It appears that, in order to have the complaint reinstated, the complainant must show that she lacked the mental capacity to make a knowing and voluntary decision. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Farin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973577 (1998), found that the complainant's withdrawal of her precomplaint complaint was voluntary, despite the complainant's assertions of coercion and depression. The Commission found no persuasive evidence of coercion, particularly where the complainant signed a separate withdrawal form for each of her five complaints and each form contained a statement that the withdrawal was not due to "threat, coercion, intimidation, promise or inducement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission further found that the opinion of the psychiatrist about the complainant's mental capacity was tainted by the assumption that she had been subjected to coercion. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Farin</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant withdrew her informal complaints on September 5, 1996. In an October 12, 1996 letter, appellant requested reinstatement of her informal complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As reason for the request, appellant stated that she was depressed, emotional and unable to make a good decision at the time of the withdrawal of her informal complaints. She also felt pressured to withdraw the complaints or to proceed with filing formal complaints. Appellant further stated that she did not have the energy to file formal complaints at the time and the EEO Counselor told her that her cases were old and had to be processed. Appellant also indicated that she was afraid that filing EEO complaints would affect her career. After leaving the EEO office, she regretted the withdrawal and was "so upset" that it took her until October 12, 1996 to request reinstatement of the withdrawn informal complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a December 14, 1996 letter, appellant's psychiatrist, who treated her from April 1996 through November 1996, indicated that appellant withdrew her informal complaints at the behest of the EEO Counselor. The psychiatrist indicated that appellant was suffering from depression and accepted the EEO Counselor's recommendation because she was easily intimidated. The psychiatrist further indicated that appellant's mental state on the date of her withdrawals affected her ability to make a reasoned and fully voluntary decision and that she should not have been pressured to withdraw the informal complaints, while she was still being treated for depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant submitted an April 17, 1996 affidavit, wherein she asserted that she was pressured by the EEO Counselor to withdraw her complaints; that she was depressed and vulnerable at the time; that the manner of the EEO Counselor, who had worked in the EEO office for 16 years, was overbearing and she was intimidated; that the EEO Counselor told her that her allegations were workers' compensation matters; that the EEO Counselor, having known her [appellant] for two years, should have recognized that she [appellant] was depressed and unable to withstand any strong suggestions; and that she was unable to complete formal complaints on that day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that a complainant may not request reinstatement of an informal complaint unless the complaint was withdrawn pursuant to a settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Allen v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940168 (May 25, 1995). Once a complainant has withdrawn an informal complaint, absent a showing of coercion, a complainant may not reactivate the EEO process by filing a complaint on the same issue<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> To allow such a practice would, in effect, extend the limitations period for filing a formal complaint ad infinitum and subvert the need for timeliness and efficiency in the EEO administrative process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that the agency's dismissal was proper. We do not find persuasive appellant's arguments that she was coerced into withdrawing her informal complaints. In December 23, 1996 and February 12, 1997 letters to the Senior EEO Complaints Specialist and the Appeals Review Specialist, the EEO Counselor stated that she met with appellant on September 5, 1996 to discuss appellant's informal complaints. Prior to meeting with appellant, she advised her of her right to representation and appellant informed her that as an EEO Counselor/Investigator herself, she [appellant] was familiar with EEO regulations and guidelines. The EEO Counselor denied intimidating or coercing appellant or expressing any opinion regarding whether appellant's claims were workers' compensation matters. The EEO Counselor stated that it was appellant who decided to withdraw the complaints of her own accord. The record also reflects that each of the five withdrawals signed by appellant contains a statement that the withdrawal did not result from threat, coercion, intimidation, promise or inducement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also cannot find that appellant lacked the mental capacity to decide to withdraw her complaints. We note that the psychiatrist's opinion is based, at least in part, on her belief that appellant was, in fact, coerced into withdrawing her complaints, a conclusion with which we do not agree. We note also that despite appellant's statement in her letter requesting reinstatement that she regretted her withdrawal after leaving the EEO office and continued to be upset in October following the September withdrawal, it is of interest that appellant was seen by her psychiatrist on September 23, 1996, and no reference was made of this allegedly upsetting event in the psychiatrist's report. In addition, the Commission is not unmindful that appellant is herself an EEO Counselor/Investigator.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Horne v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01990047 (2001), the Commission upheld dismissal of a complaint where the complainant withdrew her allegations during precomplaint counseling based on the agency's promise to reassign her if she withdrew the complaint. The complainant later contacted a counselor and asserted that she believed incidents that occurred largely before the withdrawal of her complaint could be consolidated with an earlier complaint pending before an administrative judge. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, rejected the complainant's assertion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant argues that she first contacted an EEO Counselor in September 1997. This earlier contact is confirmed by an unsigned statement from Counselor AA, obtained during an inquiry by the EEO Counselor whom complainant contacted in May 1998 (hereinafter "Counselor B"). Counselor AA's statement corroborates complainant's assertion on appeal that she was required to withdraw her informal complaint of reprisal that was pursued in September 1997. According to Counselor AA, he was assigned as complainant's EEO Counselor in September 1997, and they discussed actions of alleged reprisal by her supervisor and the abolishment of her section. Counselor AA states that he suggested speaking with a department director regarding a possible reassignment for complainant, and complainant agreed. Subsequently, the parties decided that complainant would be reassigned to an agency department identified as "G6." Counselor AA explained that when the reassignment was to be implemented, he informed complainant that "management would not approve her reassignment unless she agreed to withdraw her complaint of reprisal...." Complainant agreed, as long as her "current EEO complaint" (the complaint that was the subject of the AJ notification discussed above) would not be impacted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_126"></span>Based on a thorough review of the record, we find that while complainant contacted the EEO office in September 1997, she subsequently withdrew the matter from counseling. We are not persuaded by complainant's assertions that she believed the later matters, occurring between December 1996 and October 1997, could be considered with the separate complaint pending before the AJ. Because complainant has not provided sufficient justification for tolling or extending the time limit for contacting an EEO Counselor, the Commission finds that the agency's dismissal was proper. Complainant's initial EEO contact, in May 1998, was more than 45 days after the alleged incidents raised in the instant complaint. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss the complaint is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, where a complainant both withdraws her precomplaint complaint and files a formal complaint on the same day, the agency errs in dismissing the complaint without further inquiry into the intention of the complainant. <span class="Italic">Maynard v.
