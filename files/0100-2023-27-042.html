<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-42"><span class="space">10.</span> Subjective vs. Objective</h4>
<p class="noindent">As a general matter, the more objective the criteria used by the agency in making promotion selections, the easier it will be for the agency to defend its ultimate selection and, conversely, the rejection of other candidates. For example, the agency rebutted a complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the basis of national origin where it showed that each candidate interviewed was asked the same set of 21 questions, each interviewer scored the answers independently, and the candidate with the highest combined interview score was selected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830757 (1983). Likewise, the agency articulated a legitimate reason for its nonselection of the complainant where it demonstrated that it used a numerical scoring system to credit the experience of candidates for a position and had applied the same system to all applicants<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Pinckney v. Department of Navy</span>, 01830824 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Bart M. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120141479 (2016) (crediting the agency's explanation that the selectees all had more "recent and relevant" subject matter knowledge than the complainant as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its choice); <span class="Italic">Minh G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161339 (2016) (finding the agency presented a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the complainant's nonselection where it provided evidence that the complainant's application was disorganized and did not present his experience well). Conversely, the Commission entered a finding of discrimination where the agency ignored all objective factors related to performance and based the selection on purely subjective criteria related to "leadership skills." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 0720060082 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission defines subjective criteria as "characteristics that [can] not be substantiated." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Castro v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01871467 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Mohammed v. Callaway</span>, 698 F.2d 395 (10th Cir. 1983)). In <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, the Commission found that job attitude and behavior toward coworkers are not subjective criteria because they "are easily observable and can be evaluated." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency offered specific testimony regarding attitude and behavior. Such criteria might be considered subjective in cases where the agency makes no attempt to substantiate the characterization of the complainant's attitude and behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of subjective criteria does not establish that a particular selection was based on discriminatory motives. It is legitimate for the selecting official to consider supervisory appraisals that rate one candidate's potential higher than another's where the appraisals are based on relevant work situations. To rebut the agency's proffered reasons, the complainant must produce direct evidence of a discriminatory motive or show indirectly that the reasons are not worthy of credence. <span class="Italic">See Frey v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01830815 (1983). The fact that the use of subjective criteria results in the disparate treatment of persons is not proof of discrimination where the subjective factors are legitimate considerations for the position at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Army</span>, 01821640 (1983). But, if a complainant's qualifications are plainly superior to the selectee's, the use of selective criteria can establish discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Thorns v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05930308 (1994). Where the complainant's qualifications are plainly superior, the Commission will more strictly scrutinize the employer's reasons for making the selection, particularly if subjective criteria were used. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Varley v. Attorney General</span>, 01972338 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Varley</span>, the Commission closely examined the agency's use of "people skills" in selecting a polygraph examiner where the complainant was objectively better qualified for the job:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the agency's reliance on the "people skills" of A2 as a basis for selecting him over appellant, the Commission finds that this basis is also lacking in credibility. The agency, through several witnesses, placed great emphasis on the need for a Polygraph Examiner with good interpersonal skills. Yet, curiously, those qualities are not mentioned in the agency's own written guidelines. Rather, the qualities mentioned include: (1) investigative experience in complex investigations; (2) maturity, good judgment, and self-motivation; and (3) ability to work well alone (emphasis added). The testimony of the agency's witnesses appear contrived. Each witness gave almost the exact testimony regarding the importance of interpersonal skills. Each witness for the agency spoke only of two qualifications of a Polygraph Examiner: (1) strong investigative experience; and (2) interpersonal skills. The agency even called a full-time Polygraph Examiner (E1) as an "expert" witness. E1 testified that the MIOG, which sets out the written criteria for the Polygraph Examiner position, was simply intended to be a general guideline. The testimony of the agency's witnesses gives the impression that good people skills is unquestionably one of the most important qualities in a Polygraph Examiner. Each and every witness characterized it as being a well-recognized critical factor. However, we find it illogical that such a well-recognized, critical factor would not make the "guideline" list of criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, if, good "people skills" was, in fact, a critical aspect of the role of Polygraph Examiner, it likewise seems irrational that the Career Board would fail to acquire specific information regarding the applicants, true abilities in this area, rather than make their selections based on brief hallway encounters and rumors. As the AJ correctly noted, there are over 500 agents in the Los Angeles Field office, located on several different floors. No Career Board member worked with appellant or A2. No Career Board member reviewed any applicant's personnel file. Yet, the Board was convinced that appellant did not have the right personality for the job, despite the fact that appellant's direct supervisor stated otherwise in his recommendation. Accordingly, based upon the evidence, the Commission does not find the agency's proffered reasons for its selection credible.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of subjective criteria is often the deciding factor when the selecting official is confronted with a choice between two candidates who have substantially equal qualifications. The Commission generally will give great latitude to these subjective criteria in the absence of evidence suggesting a discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Tabor v. Department of Army</span>, 01832502 (1985) (the selecting official testified that he believed that the fact that the selectee had taken college courses would make her more readily adaptable to the position than a similarly qualified black applicant without the college courses).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where one candidate possesses a greater degree of education and experience than another, subjective criteria can still be legitimately considered in making a selection. This is particularly true if the education and experience are not requirements for the job. In <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 01A00117 (2001), the complainant was a licensed attorney with a law degree and a Master's degree in Public Administration, and had worked for the agency in a variety of capacities for more than 25 years, most recently at the GS-12 level. The selectee had a bachelor's degree and had worked for the agency for over 13 years, most recently at the GS-11 level. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> credited the agency's explanation that the additional education and <span id="Page_1578"></span>experience were not required, and that the selectee displayed a higher level of enthusiasm and better interpersonal skills required for the job:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contended that he was more qualified for the position than the selectee, noting that he had more agency experience, a more extensive education and was already at the GS-12 level. In response, the relevant agency officials stated that both were well qualified for the position and performed well in the interviews. However, they noted that the position neither required the law or Master's degrees possessed by complainant nor his more lengthy agency experience. The relevant officials averred that the determinative factors in making the selection were the selectee's high level of productivity, enthusiasm, demonstrated skills in negotiation and oral communications, willingness to travel and to take on additional work, and a perception that the selectee could better handle reporting to two separate supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As evidence of pretext, complainant again pointed to his superior academic degrees, more extensive agency experience and the fact that he was already at the GS-12 level. He further noted that the Compliance Officer position involved the interpretation of laws, questioned the selectee's productivity, and asserted that the selectee's friendship with the selecting officials was subjectively interpreted as enthusiasm. In addition, as noted above complainant asserted that the agency has never hired an African-American male to the position of Product Safety Investigator/Compliance Officer in the agency's Atlanta satellite office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, employers have discretion to choose among qualified candidates, provided that the decision is not based upon unlawful criteria<span class="Italic">. Burdine</span> at 259. While the several of the factors cited by the agency as utilized in choosing among the qualified candidates (enthusiasm, willingness to travel and to take on additional work, and a perception that the selectee could better handle reporting to two separate supervisors) are subjective, we note that the two selecting officials arrived at their judgments individually. After a thorough review of the record, we find that the complainant has failed to establish that the reasons proffered by the agency are a pretext for discrimination. In finding that complainant failed to establish discrimination, we also note that the fact that a reviewing authority may think that an employer misjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself expose the agency to Title VII liability<span class="Italic">. Burdine</span> at 259.</p>
<p class="noindent">The unique nature of a position can justify the use of subjective criteria and is not indicative of discrimination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Homer S. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120130531 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The undisputed facts fully support the AJ's determination that the responsible management officials dearly articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. After careful review of the record, as well as the arguments presented on appeal, we conclude that Complainant failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that these proffered reasons were a pretext designed to mask discrimination on any basis alleged. Complainant correctly points out that the qualities the selecting official focused on in deciding not to select him, by priority consideration, for the position were quite subjective. However, this subjectivity alone is insufficient to establish pretext. The unique nature of the position in question, which required the incumbent to serve as a proxy for the Director, provided an adequate justification for the subjectivity in selection criteria. Complainant also argued that the Director failed to contact his former or current supervisor for recommendations. However, the Director noted that Complainant was in her chain of command and she used her personal knowledge to make her decision. While Complainant may not believe this was the most reliable way of assessing his qualifications, this factor does not prove discriminatory animus was at play. Finally, Complainant points out that the selectee was interviewed while he was not. However, it is undisputed that the selectee was interviewed during the competitive selection process, and Complainant's computer score during that process did not reach the cut-off point for consideration for an interview.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Thirkill v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120121029 (2012), the agency provided a road map of how not to make a selection when it failed to credit the complainant's education and experience and gave other candidates more credit on those items than they deserved:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that it made the selection decisions based on an objective standard, when it used S1's matrix to rank the candidates. It further asserted that Complainant was not rated high enough to be offered an interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Complainant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's articulated reasons were a pretext for discrimination and/or unlawful retaliation. The record shows that S1 only credited Complainant with five to ten years experience, when he had 19 years. S1 also did not credit Complainant for his two associate degrees, as well as his specialized license. The Agency selected individuals with less education, less experience and years of service who were not Black males and who had no prior EEO activity. Although education was touted as necessary, one selectee had a high school diploma and Complainant had two associate degrees and an electrician's license. The record shows that the Agency extended an interview to individuals with no craft experience but credited them with more experience than was warranted by their resumes, based on the subjective criteria, while denying that same opportunity to Complainant and other non-White males.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The responses provided by management officials do not explain why they deviated from applying the Agency's standard Planner Candidate Assessment Instrument or why Complainant was rated in a way that failed to fully credit him with his actual years of service, education and specialized licenses. The Agency did not articulate why it imposed its requirements selectively, rather than uniformly. The matrix was based on subjective criteria that adversely denied Complainant an equal and fair opportunity to compete, based on his actual qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the application of subjective criteria in a selection process may be permissible, the Commission recognizes that the use of subjective criteria "may offer a convenient pretext for unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">Carter v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080005 (Oct. 23, 2009). Complainant's qualifications were observably superior to those of the persons selected for interview or appointment. <span class="Italic">See Bauer v. Bailor</span>, 647 F.2d. 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record shows that the Agency selected one individual (RT) whose assigned score appeared at times to be 200, which was below the 260 cut-off score. The Agency also did not interview other non-white males who scored above 260. The record also shows S2 advocated for the four Caucasian males and two Black females with lesser qualifications, who were interviewed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the record does not support the Agency's final decision or reasoning that its actions were legitimate and non-discriminatory because they were objectively based on a premise that Complainant was less qualified than the persons interviewed or selected. The Agency's rationale for not selecting complainant was pretextual because the Agency's reasons were inconsistent with the objective evidence in the record and based on inconsistently applied subjective criteria. The record before us shows that the Agency's proffered reasons are not true or legitimate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of subjective criteria, such as initiative and willingness to go "beyond the call of duty," are legitimate subjective factors that can be considered. However, when combined with the use of qualifications not listed in the vacancy announcement, it is a basis for subjecting the selection to "closer scrutiny." <span class="Italic">Rogillio v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01891516 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">McKenney v. Marsh</span>, 31 FEP 179 (D.D.C. 1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of subjective criteria in "blue collar" or lower-level positions is especially suspect and will be scrutinized carefully by the Commission. The Commission explained its position in <span class="Italic">May v. USPS</span>, 01853225 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]romotions to blue collar or other lower level positions relying on subjective criteria should be examined very closely as the reliance on subjective determinations in filling such positions can encourage and foster or at least offer a convenient pretext for discrimination, and leave ample room for the operation of bias. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Califano</span>, 613 F.2d 957 (D.C. Cir. 1979); <span class="Italic">Rowe v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 457 F.2d 348 (5th Cir. 1972). On the other hand, judicial deference to an employer's use of subjective criteria increases when upper level, supervisory or professional promotions are involved. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Board of School Comm'rs of Mobil County</span>, 600 F.2d 470 (5th Cir. 1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> on this point, 616 F.2d 719 (4th Cir. 1980)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Reliance on subjective factors, such as oral communications and interpersonal relations skills, can be appropriate, particularly as a selection factor for a supervisory position. <span class="Italic">See Zahn v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01923072 (1993). In that case, the Commission found consideration of alleged communication deficiencies on the part of the complainant was not a mask for prohibited discrimination even though that testimony surfaced for the first time at the hearing. The Commission found the selecting official placed more emphasis on other selection criteria and, in any event, there was other evidence of record to support the assessment of the complainant's skill deficiencies.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of subjective criteria combined with the rejection of an objectively better qualified minority candidate can be persuasive evidence of pretext standing by itself. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cole v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01860185 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant alleges that subjective selection criteria were applied, he or she may advance either a disparate treatment or disparate impact theory of discrimination. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Wright v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01882676 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant claims that the Supreme Court holding in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust Co.</span>, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 (1988), requires the application of a disparate impact analysis to cases where a selection is based on subjective criteria. Thus, appellant argues, the AJ and the agency erred in failing to apply the disparate impact analysis in this case where subjective selection criteria were used. However, a reading of this case reveals that it permits, not requires, the application of the disparate impact analysis to <span id="Page_1579"></span>cases where subjective selection criteria were used to make a selection. A reading of the case further reveals that it is appellant's burden to initially establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. In order to do this, appellant must introduce statistical evidence sufficient to establish that a practice operates to exclude a particular group. In this case, although appellant has presented evidence showing that certain groups are underrepresented, he has failed to present any evidence showing any causation between the underrepresentation and the utilization of the interview process.</p>
