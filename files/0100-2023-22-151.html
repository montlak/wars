<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-150"><span class="space">6.</span> Retroactivity of Remedies</h4>
<p class="noindent">The 1991 Civil Rights Act does not address specifically the issue of retroactivity of the new remedies. In <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed.2d 229 (1994), the Supreme Court held that the additional damage remedies and the corresponding right to a jury trial were not intended to be applied to cases pending on the effective date of the Act. Prior to the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the courts were split on the issue of retroactivity and the Commission vacillated. As discussed more fully below, however, a different rule may apply to certain interest provisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, in a Policy Guidance Statement issued on December 27, 1991, the Commission found that the new remedies applied only to acts of discrimination that occurred on or after November 21, 1991--the effective date of the legislation. However, on April 13, 1993, the Commission voted to rescind its policy guidance regarding retroactivity. Also reversing its previous position, the Department of Justice filed a brief in the <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> case arguing in favor of retroactivity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 93 LWUSA 99 (May 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">During the pendency of the <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> case, the Commission took the following position in <span class="Italic">Neal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924024 (1993), and several other cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]ntil the Supreme Court decides this issue of retroactivity, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will apply the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which are at issue in <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, to all open cases that on November 21, 1991, were pending at the hearing <span id="Page_1082"></span>stage. Where discrimination is found in a matter which was pending on November 21, 1991, and compensatory damages were awarded, the Commission will stay enforcement of that portion of the order granting compensatory damages until such time as the Supreme Court renders a decision in the above-referenced case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission indicated it also would apply the same policy to all cases at the agency and appellate stages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the number of courts that were split over the issue, and the Commission's own seeming inability to make up its mind on the issue, it is surprising that, ultimately, only Justice Blackmun dissented from the Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>. Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, began the <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> opinion by noting that a number of the provisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act were enacted in specific response to various recent decisions of the Supreme Court that Congress viewed as weakening "the scope and effectiveness of Federal civil rights protections." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Other provisions, he noted, were drafted with the specific intent of strengthening existing civil rights laws.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a lengthy and complex decision, the Court found the damage provisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act could not be applied retroactively. After initially discussing the failed efforts in 1990 to pass a civil rights bill and the subsequent history of the successful 1991 bill, much of the decision involves analyzing an apparent clash in two lines of cases involving statutory interpretation as it relates to the issue of retroactivity. Justice Blackmun, in his dissent, was direct and to the point. He believed that the extensive analysis of legislative history and cases involving retroactivity contained in the majority opinion missed the mark. In Justice Blackmun's view, the Act itself clearly stated that it applied to all cases pending as of its effective date. He wrote that there was no need to consider legislative history when the language of the Act was plain and unambiguous.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite its length, the <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> decision adds little to the existing body of civil rights law beyond its immediate holding. Still, for those who are interested in such things as the Court's rationale, excerpts of the <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> opinion are set forth below. The Court in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1491-96, started its opinion with a review of the legislative history:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102 also allows monetary relief for some forms of workplace discrimination that would not previously have justified any relief under Title VII. As this case illustrates, even if unlawful discrimination was proved, under prior law a Title VII plaintiff could not recover monetary relief unless the discrimination was also found to have some concrete effect on the plaintiff's employment status, such as a denied promotion, a differential in compensation, or termination. <span class="Italic">See Burke, supra</span>, at __, 112 S. Ct., at 1873-1874. ("[T]he circumscribed remedies available under Title VII [before the 1991 Act] stand in marked contrast not only to those available under traditional tort law, but under other federal antidiscrimination statutes, as well"). Section 102, however, allows a plaintiff to recover in circumstances in which there has been unlawful discrimination in the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), even though the discrimination did not involve a discharge or a loss of pay. In short, to further Title VII's "central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination," <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co.</span>, 422 U.S., at 421, 95 S. Ct., at 2373, &#x00A7; 102 of the 1991 Act effects a major expansion in the relief available to victims of employment discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1990, a comprehensive civil rights bill passed both Houses of Congress. Although similar to the 1991 Act in many other respects, the 1990 bill differed in that it contained language expressly calling for application of many of its provisions, including the section providing for damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination, to cases arising before its (expected) enactment. The President vetoed the 1990 legislation, however, citing the bill's "unfair retroactivity rules" as one reason for his disapproval. Congress narrowly failed to override the veto. <span class="Italic">See</span> 136 Cong. Rec. S16589 (Oct. 24, 1990) (66-34 Senate vote in favor of override).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The absence of comparable language in the 1991 Act cannot realistically be attributed to oversight or to unawareness of the retroactivity issue. Rather, it seems likely that one of the compromises that made it possible to enact the 1991 version was an agreement not to include the kind of explicit retroactivity command found in the 1990 bill.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The omission of the elaborate retroactivity provision of the 1990 bill--which was by no means the only source of political controversy over that legislation--is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was struck in the 1991 Act. The Legislature might, for example, have settled in 1991 on a less expansive form of retroactivity that, unlike the 1990 bill, did not reach cases already finally decided. <span class="Italic">See</span> n.8 <span class="Italic">supra</span>. A decision to reach only cases still pending might explain Congress' failure to provide in the 1991 Act, as it had in 1990, that certain sections would apply to proceedings pending on specific preenactment dates. Our first question, then, is whether the statutory text on which petitioner relies manifests an intent that the 1991 Act should be applied to cases that arose and went to trial before its enactment.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's textual argument relies on three provisions of the 1991 Act: &#x00A7; 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c). Section 402(a), the only provision of the Act that speaks directly to the question before us, states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Except as otherwise specifically provided, this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That language does not, by itself, resolve the question before us. A statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date. (10) Petitioner does not argue otherwise. Rather, she contends that the introductory clause of &#x00A7; 402(a) would be superfluous unless it refers to &#x00A7; 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for prospective application in limited contexts.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(10) The history of prior amendments to Title VII suggests that the "effective-upon-enactment" formula would have been an especially inapt way to reach pending cases. When it amended Title VII in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Congress explicitly provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"The amendments made by this Act to section 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be applicable with respect to charges pending with the Commission on the date of enactment of this Act and all charges filed thereafter." Pub. L. 92-261, &#x00A7; 14, 86 Stat. 113.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In contrast, in amending Title VII to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy in 1978, Congress provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendment made by this Act shall be effective on the date of enactment." &#x00A7; 2(a), 92 Stat. 2076.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The only Courts of Appeals to consider whether the 1978 amendments applied to pending cases concluded that they did not. <span class="Italic">See Schwabenbauer v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. of Olean</span>, 667 F.2d 305, 310 n.7 (CA2 1981); <span class="Italic">Condit v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 631 F.2d 1136, 1139-1140 (CA4 1980). <span class="Italic">See also Jensen v. Gulf Oil Refining &#x0026; Marketing Co.</span>, 623 F.2d 406, 410 (CA5 1980) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act amendments designated to "take effect on the date of enactment of this Act" inapplicable to case arising before enactment); <span class="Italic">Sikora v. American Can Co.</span>, 622 F.2d 1116, 1119-1124 (CA3 1980) (same). If we assume that Congress was familiar with those decisions, <span class="Italic">cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago</span>, 441 U.S. 677, 698-699, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 1958-1959, 60 L. Ed.2d 560 (1979), its choice of language in &#x00A7; 402(a) would imply non-retroactivity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that &#x00A7; 402(b) was intended to exempt a single disparate impact lawsuit against the Wards Cove Packing Company. Section 402(b) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CERTAIN DISPARATE IMPACT CASES</span>.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in this Act shall apply to any disparate impact case for which a complaint was filed before March 1, 1975, and for which an initial decision was rendered after October 30, 1983."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 109(c), part of the section extending Title VII to overseas employers, states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS</span>.--The amendments made by this section shall not apply with respect to conduct occurring before the date of the enactment of this Act."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to petitioner, these two subsections are the "other provisions" contemplated in the first clause of &#x00A7; 402(a), and together create a strong negative inference that all sections of the Act not specifically declared prospective apply to pending cases that arose before November 21, 1991. Before addressing the particulars of petitioner's argument, we observe that she places extraordinary weight on two comparatively minor and narrow provisions in a long and complex statute. Applying the entire Act to cases arising from preenactment conduct would have important consequences, including the possibility that trials completed before its enactment would need to be retried and the possibility that employers would be liable for punitive damages for conduct antedating the Act's enactment. Purely prospective application, on the other hand, would prolong the life of a remedial scheme, and of judicial constructions of civil rights statutes, that Congress obviously found wanting. Given the high stakes of the retroactivity question, the broad coverage of the statute, and the prominent and specific retroactivity provisions in the 1990 bill, it would be surprising for Congress to have chosen to resolve that question through negative inferences drawn from two provisions of quite limited effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner, however, invokes the canon that a court should give effect to every provision of a statute and thus avoid redundancy among different provisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &#x0026; Service, Inc.</span>, 486 U.S. 825, 837, and n.11, 108 S. Ct. 2182, 2189, and n.11, 100 L. Ed.2d 836 (1988). Unless the word "otherwise" in &#x00A7; 402(a) refers to either &#x00A7; 402(b) <span id="Page_1083"></span>or &#x00A7; 109(c), she contends, the first five words in &#x00A7; 402(a) are entirely superfluous. Moreover, relying on the canon "<span class="Italic">[e]xpressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>," <span class="Italic">see Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</span>, 509 U.S. __, __, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 1163, 122 L. Ed.2d 517 (1993), petitioner argues that because Congress provided specifically for prospectivity in two places (sections 109(c) and 402(b)), we should infer that it intended the opposite for the remainder of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner emphasizes that &#x00A7; 402(a) begins: "Except as otherwise specifically provided." A scan of the statute for other "specific provisions" concerning effective dates reveals that &#x00A7; 402(b) and 109(c) are the most likely candidates. Since those provisions decree prospectivity, and since &#x00A7; 402(a) tells us that the specific provisions are <span class="Italic">exceptions</span>, &#x00A7; 402(b) should be considered as prescribing a general rule of retroactivity. Petitioner's argument has some force, but we find it most unlikely that Congress intended the introductory clause to carry the critically important meaning petitioner assigns it. Had Congress wished &#x00A7; 402(a) to have such a determinate meaning, it surely would have used language comparable to its reference to the predecessor Title VII damages provisions in the 1990 legislation: that the new provisions "shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment of this Act." S. 2104, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. &#x00A7; 15(a)(4) (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is entirely possible that Congress inserted the "otherwise specifically provided" language not because it understood the "takes effect" clause to establish a rule of retroactivity to which only two "other specific provisions" would be exceptions, but instead to assure that any specific timing provisions in the Act would prevail over the general "take effect on enactment" command. The drafters of a complicated piece of legislation containing more than 50 separate sections may well have inserted the "except as otherwise provided" language merely to avoid the risk of an inadvertent conflict in the statute. If the introductory clause of &#x00A7; 402(a) was intended to refer specifically to &#x00A7; 402(b), 109(c), or both, it is difficult to understand why the drafters chose the word "otherwise" rather than either or both of the appropriate section numbers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's argument that both &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 402(b) and 109(c) merely duplicate the "take effect upon enactment" command of &#x00A7; 402(a) unless all other provisions, including the damages provisions of &#x00A7; 102, apply to pending cases. That argument depends on the assumption that all those other provisions must be treated uniformly for purposes of their application to pending cases based on preenactment conduct. That thesis, however, is by no means an inevitable one. It is entirely possible--indeed, highly probable--that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of the 1990 legislation, Congress viewed the matter as an open issue to be resolved by the courts. Our precedents on retroactivity left doubts about what default rule would apply in the absence of congressional guidance, and suggested that some provisions might apply to cases arising before enactment while others might not. Compare <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital</span>, 488 U.S. 204, 109 S. Ct. 468, 102 L. Ed.2d 493 (1988) with <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Richmond School Bd.</span>, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S. Ct. 2006, 40 L. Ed.2d 476 (1974). <span class="Italic">See</span> also <span class="Italic">Bennett v. New Jersey</span>, 470 U.S. 632, 105 S. Ct. 1555, 84 L. Ed.2d 572 (1985). The only matters Congress did not leave to the courts were set out with specificity in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 109(c) and 402(b). Congressional doubt concerning judicial retroactivity doctrine, coupled with the likelihood that the routine "take effect upon enactment" language would require courts to fall back upon that doctrine, provide a plausible explanation for both &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 402(b) and 109(c) that makes neither provision redundant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the text of &#x00A7; 402(b), it seems unlikely that the introductory phrase ("Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act") was meant to refer to the immediately preceding subsection. Since petitioner does not contend that any other provision speaks to the general effective date issue, the logic of her argument requires us to interpret that phrase to mean nothing more than "Notwithstanding &#x00A7; 402(a)." Petitioner's textual argument assumes that the drafters selected the indefinite word "otherwise" in &#x00A7; 402(a) to identify two specific subsections and the even more indefinite term "any other provision" in &#x00A7; 402(b) to refer to nothing more than &#x00A7; 402(b)'s next-door neighbor--&#x00A7; 402(a). Here again, petitioner's statutory argument would require us to assume that Congress chose a surprisingly indirect route to convey an important and easily expressed message concerning the Act's effect on pending cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevant legislative history of the 1991 Act reinforces our conclusion that &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 402(a), 109(c) and 402(b) cannot bear the weight petitioner places upon them. The 1991 bill as oriGINAlly introduced in the House contained explicit retroactivity provisions similar to those found in the 1990 bill. However, the Senate substitute that was agreed upon omitted those explicit retroactivity provisions. The legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement. The history reveals no evidence that Members believed that an agreement had been tacitly struck on the controversial retroactivity issue, and little to suggest that Congress understood or intended the interplay of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 402(a), 402(b) and 109(c) to have the decisive effect petitioner assigns them. Instead, the history of the 1991 Act conveys the impression that legislators agreed to disagree about whether and to what extent the Act would apply to preenactment conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court concluded that, although a majority of Congress that passed both the 1990 and 1991 versions of the Civil Rights Act may have favored retroactivity, there was no clear expression of that fact in the legislative history of the bill. The Court then went on to address the apparent conflict in two lines of cases involving retroactivity. Ultimately, in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1496-1508, the Court concluded the lines of cases were not conflicting, but rather applied to two distinct situations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not uncommon to find "apparent tension" between different canons of statutory construction. As Professor Llewellyn famously illustrated, many of the traditional canons have equal opposites. In order to resolve the question left open by the 1991 Act, federal courts have labored to reconcile two seemingly contradictory statements found in our decisions concerning the effect of intervening changes in the law. Each statement is framed as a generally applicable rule for interpreting statutes that do not specify their temporal reach. The first is the rule that "a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision," <span class="Italic">Bradley</span>, 416 U.S., at 711, 94 S. Ct., at 2016. The second is the axiom that "[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law," and its interpretive corollary that "congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result." <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, 488 U.S., at 208, 109 S. Ct., at 471.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have previously noted the "apparent tension" between those expressions. <span class="Italic">See Kaiser Aluminum &#x0026; Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno</span>, 494 U.S. 827, 837, 110 S. Ct. 1570, 1577, 108 L. Ed.2d 842 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also Bennett</span>, 470 U.S., at 639-640, 105 S. Ct., at 1560. We found it unnecessary in <span class="Italic">Kaiser</span> to resolve that seeming conflict "because under either view, where the congressional intent is clear, it governs," and the prejudgment interest statute at issue in that case evinced "clear congressional intent" that it was "not applicable to judgments entered before its effective date." 494 U.S., at 837-838, 110 S. Ct., at 1577. In the case before us today, however, we have concluded that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 does not evince any clear expression of intent on &#x00A7; 102's application to cases arising before the Act's enactment. We must, therefore, focus on the apparent tension between the rules we have espoused for handling similar problems in the absence of an instruction from Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin by noting that there is no tension between the <span class="Italic">holdings</span> in <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> and <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, both of which were unanimous decisions. Relying on another unanimous decision--<span class="Italic">Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham</span>, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S. Ct. 518, 21 L. Ed.2d 474 (1969)--we held in <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> that a statute authorizing the award of attorney's fees to successful civil rights plaintiffs applied in a case that was pending on appeal at the time the statute was enacted. <span class="Italic">Bowen</span> held that the Department of Health and Human Services lacked statutory authority to promulgate a rule requiring private hospitals to refund Medicare payments for services rendered before promulgation of the rule. Our opinion in <span class="Italic">Bowen</span> did not purport to overrule <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> or to limit its reach. In this light, we turn to the "apparent tension" between the two canons mindful of another canon of unquestionable vitality, the "maxim not to be disregarded that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used." <span class="Italic">Cohens v. Virginia</span>, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821).</p>
<p class="noindent-c">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As JUSTICE SCALIA has demonstrated, the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted. For that reason, the "principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." <span class="Italic">Kaiser</span>, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 S. Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for the Court in <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Graham</span>, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S. Ct. 960, 67 L. Ed.2d 17 (1981), the <span class="Italic">Ex Post Facto</span> Clause not only ensures that individuals have "fair warning" about the effect of criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 28-29, 101 S. Ct., at 963-964 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Constitution's restrictions, of course, are of limited scope. Absent <span id="Page_1084"></span>a violation of one of those specific provisions, the potential unfairness of retroactive civil legislation is not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute its intended scope. Retroactivity provisions often serve entirely benign and legitimate purposes, whether to respond to emergencies, to correct mistakes, to prevent circumvention of a new statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage, or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law Congress considers salutary. However, a requirement that Congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the early days of this Court, we have declined to give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights unless Congress had made clear its intent. Thus, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Heth</span>, 3 Cranch 399, 2 L. Ed. 479 (1806), we refused to apply a federal statute reducing the commissions of customs collectors to collections commenced before the statute's enactment because the statute lacked "clear, strong, and imperative" language requiring retroactive application,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 413 (opinion of Paterson, J.). The presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference to the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the fact. Indeed, at common law a contrary rule applied to statutes that merely removed a burden on private rights by repealing a penal provision (whether criminal or civil); such repeals were understood to preclude punishment for acts antedating the repeal. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., United States v. Chambers</span>, 291 U.S. 217, 223-224, 54 S. Ct. 434, 435-436, 78 L. Ed. 763 (1934); <span class="Italic">Gulf, C. &#x0026; S. F. R. Co. v. Dennis</span>, 224 U.S. 503, 506, 32 S. Ct. 542, 543, 56 L. Ed. 860 (1912); <span class="Italic">United States v. Tynen</span>, 11 Wall. 88, 93-95, 20 L. Ed. 153 (1871); <span class="Italic">Norris v. Crocker</span>, 13 How. 429, 440-441, 14 L. Ed. 210 (1852); <span class="Italic">Maryland v. Baltimore &#x0026; Ohio R. Co.</span>, 3 How. 534, 552, 11 L. Ed. 714 (1845); <span class="Italic">Yeaton v. United States</span> 5 Cranch 281, 284, 3 L. Ed. 101 (1809). <span class="Italic">But see</span> 1 USC &#x00A7; 109 (repealing common-law rule).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The largest category of cases in which we have applied the presumption against statutory retroactivity has involved new provisions affecting contractual or property rights, matters in which predictability and stability are of prime importance. The presumption has not, however, been limited to such cases. At issue in <span class="Italic">Chew Heong v. United States</span>, 112 U.S. 536, 5 S. Ct. 255, 28 L. Ed. 770 (1884), for example, was a provision of the "Chinese Restriction Act" of 1882 barring Chinese laborers from reentering the United States without a certificate prepared when they exited this country. We held that the statute did not bar the reentry of a laborer who had left the United States before the certification requirement was promulgated. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court observed that the law in effect before the 1882 enactment had accorded laborers a right to re-enter without a certificate, and invoked the "uniformly" accepted rule against "giv[ing] to statutes a retrospective operation, whereby rights previously vested are injuriously affected, unless compelled to do so by language so clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt that such was the intention of the legislature." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 559, 5 S. Ct., at 266-267.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we have long embraced a presumption against statutory retroactivity, for just as long we have recognized that, in many situations, a court should "apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision," <span class="Italic">Bradley</span>, 416 U.S., at 711, 94 S. Ct., at 2016, even though that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit. There is, of course, no conflict between that principle and a presumption against retroactivity when the statute in question is unambiguous. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in <span class="Italic">United States v. Schooner Peggy</span>, 1 Cranch 103, 2 L. Ed. 49 (1801), illustrates this point. Because a treaty signed on September 30, 1800, while the case was pending on appeal, unambiguously provided for the restoration of captured property "not yet definitively condemned,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 107 (emphasis in oriGINAl), we reversed a decree entered on September 23, 1800, condemning a French vessel that had been seized in American waters. Our application of "the law in effect" at the time of our decision in <span class="Italic">Schooner Peggy</span> was simply a response to the language of the statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 109.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even absent specific legislative authorization, application of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations. When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive. Thus, in <span class="Italic">American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council</span>, 257 U.S. 184, 42 S. Ct. 72, 66 L. Ed. 189 (1921), we held that &#x00A7; 20 of the Clayton Act, enacted while the case was pending on appeal, governed the propriety of injunctive relief against labor picketing. In remanding the suit for application of the intervening statute, we observed that "relief by injunction operates in futuro," and that the plaintiff had no "vested right" in the decree entered by the trial court. 257 U.S., at 201, 42 S. Ct., at 75-76. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Hall v. Beals</span>, 396 U.S. 45, 48, 90 S. Ct. 200, 201-202, 24 L. Ed.2d 214 (1969); <span class="Italic">Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering</span>, 254 U.S. 443, 464, 41 S. Ct. 172, 175, 65 L. Ed. 349 (1921).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Bruner v. United States</span>, 343 U.S. 112, 116-117, 72 S. Ct. 581, 584-585, 96 L. Ed. 786 (1952), relying on our "consisten[t]" practice, we ordered an action dismissed because the jurisdictional statute under which it had been (properly) filed was subsequently repealed. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hallowell v.

Ed.2d 570 (1978), we held that, because a statute passed while the case was pending on appeal had eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement for federal question cases, the fact that respondent had failed to allege $10,000 in controversy at the commencement of the action was "now of no moment." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Alabama</span>, 362 U.S. 602, 604, 80 S. Ct. 924, 926, 4 L. Ed.2d 982 (1960) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">Stephens v.

Application of a new jurisdictional rule usually "takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case." <span class="Italic">Hallowell</span>, 239 U.S., at 508, 36 S. Ct., at 202. Present law normally governs in such situations because jurisdictional statutes "speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties," <span class="Italic">Republic Nat. Bank of Miami</span>, 506 U.S., at __, 113 S. Ct., at 565 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now ask whether, given the absence of guiding instructions from Congress, &#x00A7; 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is the type of provision that should govern cases arising before its enactment. As we observed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1494, there is no special reason to think that all the diverse provisions of the Act must be treated uniformly for such purposes. To the contrary, we understand the instruction that the provisions are to "take effect upon enactment" to mean that courts should evaluate each provision of the Act in light of ordinary judicial principles concerning the application of new rules to pending cases and pre-enactment conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two provisions of &#x00A7; 102 may be readily classified according to these principles. The jury trial right set out in &#x00A7; 102(c)(1) is plainly a procedural change of the sort that would ordinarily govern in trials conducted after its effective date. If &#x00A7; 102 did no more than introduce a right to jury trial in Title VII cases, the provision would presumably apply to cases tried after November 21, 1991, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred. However, because &#x00A7; 102(c) makes a jury trial available only "[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages," the jury trial option must stand or fall with the attached damages provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102(b)(1) is clearly on the other side of the line. That subsection authorizes punitive damages if the plaintiff shows that the defendant "engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual." The very labels given "punitive" or "exemplary" damages, as well as the rationales that support them, demonstrate that they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions. Retroactive imposition of punitive damages would raise a serious constitutional question. <span class="Italic">See Turner Elkhorn</span> 428 U.S., at 17, 96 S. Ct., at 2893 (Court would "hesitate to approve the retrospective imposition of liability on any theory of deterrence...or blameworthiness"); <span class="Italic">De Veau v. Braisted</span>, 363 U.S. 144, 160, 80 S. Ct. 1146, 1155, 4 L. Ed.2d 1109 (1960) ("The mark of an <span class="Italic">ex post facto</span> law is the imposition of what can fairly be designated punishment for past acts"). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Louis Vuitton S.A. v. Spencer Handbags Corp.</span>, 765 F.2d 966, 972 (CA2 1985) (retroactive application of punitive treble damages provisions of Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 "would present a potential <span class="Italic">ex post facto</span> problem"). Before we entertained that question, we would have to be confronted with a statute that explicitly authorized punitive damages for preenactment conduct. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 contains no such explicit command.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision of &#x00A7; 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery of compensatory damages is not easily classified. It does not make unlawful conduct that was lawful when it occurred; as we have noted, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1490-1491, &#x00A7; 102 only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concerns about a lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that such discrimination was in many cases (although not this one) already subject to monetary liability in the form of backpay. Nor could anyone <span id="Page_1085"></span>seriously contend that the compensatory damages provisions smack of a "retributive" or other suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects Congress' desire to afford victims of discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules established more than a generation ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At least with respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then, &#x00A7; 102 is not in a category in which objections to retroactive application on grounds of fairness have their greatest force.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provision would operate "retrospectively" if it were applied to conduct occurring before November 21, 1991. Unlike certain other forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintessentially backward-looking. Compensatory damages may be <span class="Italic">intended</span> less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victims whole, but they do so by a mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not "compensate" by distributing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring particular employers to pay for harms they caused. The introduction of a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties' planning. In this case, the event to which the new damages provision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent John Williams; if applied here, that provision would attach an important new legal burden to that conduct. The new damages remedy in &#x00A7; 102, we conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It will frequently be true, as petitioner and <span class="Italic">amici</span> forcefully argue here, that retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully. That consideration, however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against retroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursue a single goal, and compromises necessary to their enactment may require adopting means other than those that would most effectively pursue the main goal. A legislator who supported a prospective statute might reasonably oppose retroactive application of the same statute. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the omission of the 1990 version's express retroactivity provisions was a factor in the passage of the 1991 bill. Section 102 is plainly not the sort of provision that <span class="Italic">must</span> be understood to operate retroactively because a contrary reading would render it ineffective.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> applies only to substantive provisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. At least one court has held that the amendment to the 1991 Act permitting interest on attorney fees and costs is not a substantive provision, but a collateral provision. Interest on attorney fees and costs are retroactive and apply to cases that were pending on the date the Act became effective. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Marsh</span>, 868 F. Supp. 15 (D.D.C. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sundt v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01920681 (1992), the Commission reaffirmed its oriGINAl policy statement regarding the retroactivity of the compensatory damages clause and declined to award compensatory damages in a case involving the breach of a settlement agreement where the breach occurred prior to the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. In reaffirming its stance, the Commission noted that the allegation of breach was filed before November 21, 1991. In so doing, the Commission left open the prospect that, in breach of settlement agreement cases, it will be the date of breach and not the date of the oriGINAl claim of discrimination that controls whether the compensatory damage provision of the new civil rights legislation applies.</p>
