<h2 class="h2" id="ch05">DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2021, Executive Order 14035 was issued directing agencies to make diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility a priority. The goal is to "cultivate a workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation" and the federal government is at its best when drawing upon all parts of society because "our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering the importance of this initiative, agency HR offices have been tasked to develop an agency-specific DEIA strategic plan that is consistent with law and merit system principles. Become acquainted with your agency's plan so that you can do your part to create and foster a DEIA environment which can help you capitalize on the range of your employee's talents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>What is DEIA?</b> According to EO 14035, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility are defined as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Diversity</b> refers to the practice of including the many communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures, and beliefs of the American people, including underserved communities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Equity</b> means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. Underserved communities are populations sharing a particular characteristic, or geography, who have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Inclusion</b> means the recognition, appreciation, and use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Accessibility</b> is the design, construction, development, and maintenance of facilities, information and communication technology, programs, and services so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. This includes providing accommodations and modifications to ensure individuals with disabilities have equal access to employment and participation in activities, reducing or eliminating physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, committing to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently access every outward-facing and internal activity or electronic space, and pursuing the best practices, such as universal design.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Your role as a manager.</b> "Leveraging diversity" is one of the key competencies on which you are evaluated as a federal manager. Your rating in this area may affect your performance rating and, therefore, your future career. With EO 14035, you may see changes that add equity, inclusion, and accessibility to your performance requirements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In general terms, to ensure DEIA, you should:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Manage your workforce so that you model and enforce respect for all employees, who are valued for their diverse backgrounds and promote equity, inclusion, and accessibility in your programs.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Engage in recruiting, hiring, and retention efforts to promote DEIA in your workforce. Manage your workforce to get the most out of every employee, leveraging DEIA to achieve positive business results.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Manage your own behavior and that of your employees to discourage any form of bias, inequity, or discrimination. If you spot inappropriate behavior, take corrective action.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">In addition, to ensure DEIA is a priority across the federal government, EO 14035 specifically directs agency heads to take steps to implement or increase the availability and use of DEIA training programs that should:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Provide employees, managers, and leaders knowledge of systemic and institutional racism and bias against underserved communities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Help build skillsets to promote respectful and inclusive workplaces and eliminate workplace harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Educate employees, managers, and leaders on agency accessibility practices.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Provide an increased understanding of implicit and unconscious bias.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">So, not only do employees have to be trained, but managers also must participate in DEIA training.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>What does diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility look like?</b> How can you measure the DEIA of your workforce? Generally, we use variations of categories long established as protected against discrimination by equal employment opportunity law:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Sex.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Age.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Race.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Color.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> National origin.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Religion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Disability.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">More recently, employees have been protected against discrimination because of genetic information. Although it is not a factor in measuring a diverse workforce, any bias or discrimination on the basis of genetic information would be considered a failure in diversity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited as sex discrimination under Title VII. Any adverse actions against employees on these bases would be a failure to leverage DEIA and could also lead to liability under EEO law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In addition to these traditional legal avenues, EO 14035 has directed OPM and OMB to work with the EEOC to come up with data-driven approaches to measure, ensure, and promote accountability for DEIA in the agency's workforce composition.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Building diversity</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Workforce diversity doesn't just happen. It's the result of consistent efforts to leverage diversity by managers who clearly understand and support the agency's diversity goals -- and then take the steps necessary to reach them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Building a diverse workforce requires more than good intentions. Let's look at what you need to do to create and leverage a diverse workforce.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Understand the staffing process and alternatives.</b> As a manager, it is your job to work closely with HR staffing specialists to recruit and hire the employees you need. This cooperation, which may extend to your agency's EEO office, has the twin goals of:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Providing you with the employees you need to perform your mission.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Recruiting and promoting from the most diverse pool of qualified applicants possible.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">If you fill every vacancy simply by posting announcements and hoping for the best, you'll probably have a hard time meeting agency diversity goals or finding the best qualified applicants for that matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are a variety of special hiring authorities and other techniques managers can use to recruit qualified candidates across the spectrum of available workers. Ask your agency's staffing professionals to explain the various alternatives open to you when filling vacancies. And don't just settle for an inventory of the various programs available. Ask for specific advice on how you could use some or all of them to attract a more diverse range of candidates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Remember:</b> Meeting your agency's diversity goals never requires you to hire a candidate because of the category to which that candidate belongs. You are not expected to fill some sort of hiring quota, which would be illegal in any case. You are expected to work with HR to increase the diversity of the pool of qualified candidates from which you select your new employees. This process is often called "affirmative employment."</p>
<h3 class="h3">Promoting equity</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">President Biden has prioritized making sure that federal employment practices go beyond providing equal employment opportunity to ensuring equitable outcomes. So, as a manager, you should be aware of the current administration's push for more equity in federal employment, as laid out in Executive Order 14035, which presents a plan, framework, and deadlines for OPM, OMB, and agencies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although this strong focus on equity may eventually mean more accountability for managers, this won't happen until after OPM and OMB generate a governmentwide plan and agencies develop an agency-specific plan. Nonetheless, managers are likely to see their agencies assess and report the status of their current DEIA initiatives and determine whether the agency's employment path is equitable. This will require agencies to look at equity in agency recruitment, hiring, promotion, retention, professional development, performance evaluations, pay and compensation policies, reasonable accommodations access, and training policies and practices.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Equity versus equality.</b> Although EO 14035 defines equity, to most people, the difference between equality and equity may not be so clear even though both promote fairness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Equality generally refers to providing people the same employment resources or opportunities. EO 14035 defines equity as "the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment." In more general terms, equity is often described as allocating the specific resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal and just outcome with the understanding that people have different circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To visualize the difference, consider a workplace that provides employees the same type of bicycle to perform their work regardless of individual differences. Although employees are getting equal tools with the same exact bike, the result is inequitable because this bike is too small for the tall employee, too big for a much shorter employee, and completely unusable for an employee who uses a wheelchair. To promote an equitable outcome, the employer would need to provide the right-sized bike for the tall and short employees and a bike modified for someone who uses a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are some examples showing the difference between "equality" and "equity" efforts at the workplace:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assignments.</b> Ensuring everyone gets an assignment might be equal but inequitable if some assignments are more beneficial. Consider a situation where Jack and Jenny are given details. However, Jenny is given one without formally inputting the requisite forms in her personnel file while Jack is credited for the detail in his file. Even though both had detail assignments, Jack will be able to use the assignment for promotions while Jenny will not because her boss did not properly record the detail. For equity, Jenny's manager would have the same information formally annotated in her record with the correct standard form which would allow her to apply for the same jobs and promotion as Jack.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Networking.</b> An equality-based approach would invite all employees (or members of a particular team or office) to networking events, such as informal happy hours or barbeques, conferences and seminars, and sports leagues or events. However, non-white college graduates are more likely to be first-generation college attendees, which means they are less likely to have access to the professional networks which can provide key advice for getting key positions. Consequently, first-generation professionals may not know how important going to a certain seminar or going to an agency baseball game event is for getting to know higher level officials and getting a promotion. In an equity-based approach, a manager would recognize that their team may not have equal knowledge of the significance of these events and let them all know that these events are important for advancement and promotion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Advancement and promotions.</b> Even though the government has mechanisms for ensuring equal employment opportunity to apply for jobs -- such as ensuring job vacancies are posted for all eligibles to apply regardless of membership in an underserved community, not everyone knows how to become eligible for jobs that would take them to the next stage of their careers. Plus, in many instances, the specific steps for a certain career path are not clearly outlined so employees do not know that they have to get certain experience to increase their chances of advancement. Not having clear paths often leaves underrepresented groups at a disadvantage because they may not have had a mentor or boss telling them how to achieve their goals. To ensure equitable advancement opportunities, agencies would have to ensure that all employees know the steps for getting to the next stage in their careers. Having clear standardized career paths -- that outline specific training, certifications, and experience needed to get to each higher-level career stage -- helps reduce the confusion over how to get to the next stage and place eligible employees at the same starting point. If the agency does not have set career paths, you can create these guidelines with and for your employees so that everyone knows how to get to the next stage of their career, along with using individual development plans to push employees along these paths.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Underserved communities in the federal workforce.</b> To understand the breadth of your responsibility to promote equity, you also must know the meaning of "underserved communities." Under EO 14035, these are populations sharing a particular characteristic or geography who have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the context of the federal workforce, underserved communities are defined as:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals belonging to communities of color, such as Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, Alaska Native and Indigenous, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, and North African persons.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals whose communities face discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, including LGBTQ+ individuals.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> People who face discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions or their status as parents and caregivers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals whose communities face discrimination based on their religion or disability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> First-generation professionals or first-generation college students.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals with limited English proficiency and immigrants.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals whose communities may face employment barriers based on older age or former incarceration.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> People who live in rural areas.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Veterans and military spouses.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> People who are otherwise adversely affected by "persistent poverty, discrimination, or inequality."</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Pay equity.</b> Another potential change is directed at making pay more equitable across the board so someone who does the same job as another employee is paid the same regardless of the amount they earned before they took this job. EO 14035 instructs OPM to review regulations to address any pay inequities, including job classifications and compensation practices, and whether to prohibit agencies from seeking or relying on salary history to set pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Hiring equity.</b> EO 14035 tasks agencies with moving away from relying on unpaid internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships because people from underserved communities often are unable to take an unpaid position. So, people who need paid jobs may not take unpaid positions, which offer key experience, relationships, and mentoring that can get them into a full-time position. This policy change is designed to give people from underserved communities more equitable access to these positions that often lead to full-time government employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM and OMB will issue guidance on how to increase availability of paid versus unpaid internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships. According to EO 14035, these programs should:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Serve as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the competitive hiring process.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Improve outreach and recruitment of individuals from underserved communities.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Serve to develop individuals' talent, knowledge, and skills for careers in government service.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Ensure individuals with disabilities have a process for requesting reasonable accommodations.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">The EO also directs OPM to evaluate any possible barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in getting federal jobs and the effect of those barriers on the civil service. OPM also must evaluate possible actions to expand federal employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals, including a new hiring authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Equity in performance appraisals and promotions.</b> To ensure performance standards and appraisals are fair, you must ask the "right questions" and solicit broad perspectives when setting standards. Often people designing performance standards and reviews are not thinking about how stereotypes and biases are informing their traditional views on the criteria for a high performer. When working with HR to design standards, as a manager, you should:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Get broad input and consult with a diverse group of individuals with different experiences when designing these measurements. This can help make the evaluation process more equitable, which ultimately impacts who will get a promotion and move up in their careers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Take an internal look at whether built-in biases or stereotypes are affecting evaluations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Consider new or non-traditional ways of measuring performance criteria. People often get stuck in a very narrow, limiting way of thinking on the criteria for a high performer, which can be based on stereotypes or how a dominant group has done things in the past. Ask yourself whether other factors should be added to the criteria or measurements.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Consider headwinds or challenges employees may have faced. Learn more about headwinds in the <b>Foster inclusion</b> section.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Foster inclusion</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Along with diversity, equity, and accessibility, you also have to foster inclusion to connect all employees to the workplace and harness their potential. Inclusion occurs when your workplace culture encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness to enable employees to participate to their fullest. The resulting respect and understanding allows your employees to work better together, learn and grow from each other, feel like they have a voice, and gain opportunities to develop and maximize their potential. Inclusion also serves to instill trust in management, which is vital to a fair workplace.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By incorporating more diverse perspectives into each workplace goal, challenge, or assignment, you can embed inclusion into the office culture, rather than a separate diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility effort. This requires you to serve as an example, adopt key practices, and make inclusion a daily practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be an inclusive leader, you should adopt these key principles:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Visible commitment.</b> Authentically articulate your commitment to DEIA, hold yourself and others accountable, and make DEIA a priority. This will be especially important once OPM releases guidance on adding DEIA as a criterion in performance evaluations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Humility.</b> Be modest about your capabilities, admit mistakes, and mindfully and proactively make enough space for others to contribute.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Awareness of bias.</b> To avoid bias, challenge yourself before each decision to ensure objectivity, equity, and fairness are present. This includes examining any systemic flaws that may exist. Work to ensure meritocracy in assignments, benefits, development, and personnel actions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Curiosity and cultural intelligence.</b> Keep an open mindset, be curious about others, listen without judgment, try to be empathetic to understand others, be attentive to other cultures, and adapt as needed.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Effective collaboration.</b> Empower others, be attentive about promoting diversity of thinking and psychological safety, and foster cohesiveness within the team.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">While adopting these key principles, consider the following to foster an inclusive culture in your workplace:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Develop an inclusive orientation process for new employees.</b> Involve a variety of staff members in the orientation process. This will demonstrate to employees that their contributions are valued, and it will indoctrinate the new employee to the inclusive culture in your work unit.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Involve new people in key projects.</b> When choosing members for a team or project, consider these questions: 1) Who is currently or will potentially be affected?; 2) Who can bring diverse thinking?; and 3) Who would grow by helping to tackle this challenge? This will help you incorporate individuals who may not otherwise have been included, improve engagement, and provide new perspectives. Varied viewpoints -- such as from different generations and fields -- can help teams flourish and take on challenges more successfully. Different views can also result in better morale, more buy-in, a better more-informed process, and the ability to cover potential "blind spots."</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Gather information on the perceptions of your employees.</b> It helps to understand their views of an inclusive office environment. Discuss the issue with new employees as well. They can share their observations with a degree of objectivity. Conduct employee surveys or set up focus groups to explore the issue. Add inclusion questions to your exit interviews. Once you gather this information, act on it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Encourage awareness of others' headwinds and tailwinds.</b> "Headwinds" are the things in life that can make progress more difficult, while "tailwinds" are the privileges that propel employees forward faster than those with no tailwind and those facing the challenges posed by a headwind. Those facing a headwind can work just as hard as others but not make the same progress forward. Framing the conversation around headwinds and tailwinds often has better response than discussing privilege, a word that can often elicit heated responses from some. Some examples of potential headwinds include race or color, being a woman in a male-dominated field, being a first generation professional, coming from a lower socio-economic background, or having a medical condition. Potential tailwinds may include having mentors, education, family support, socio-economic status, or a financially stable home. Not understanding people's headwinds can lead to a variety of unproductive behaviors, including acting entitled, stereotyping, lacking empathy, and being judgmental. In contrast, awareness can build camaraderie and increase productivity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Utilize flexible policies and work schedules.</b> Accommodating staff when possible exhibits a respect for their job responsibilities and can enhance their work/life balance. Your ability to be flexible with your employees is an excellent ingredient of an inclusive culture.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Support participation in employee affinity and resource groups.</b> These networking groups offer opportunities for employees to meet and share ideas outside of the work unit. Affinity groups can be based on a wide variety of interests and shared backgrounds such as age, race, gender, disability status, sexual orientation, and military service. Your support will show that you "walk the walk."</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Start a wellness program.</b> Living a healthy lifestyle is important to everyone. A wellness program creates a common goal among staff and can improve workforce health and productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Workers with a variety of backgrounds bring a corresponding variety of insights and skills to the table. Show your employees you embrace their experiences, insights, and skills and leverage them strategically to serve your customers and perform your mission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Using the varied talents of your employees not only has immediate positive business results, but it also helps you to retain those employees and therefore increases the diversity of the employee pool available for promotion to higher grades.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your seasoned employees are an important part of your diverse workforce. If they have been with the agency for several years, they carry a great deal of institutional knowledge. Consider asking a seasoned worker to mentor a new hire. The onboarding process will go more smoothly, and you'll be sending the message that these employees are a valued resource.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees who speak a second language are also a great resource. They can help your agency communicate with customers and community stakeholders who speak their language. Consider asking these employees to provide an informal training to other workers on their language -- for example, "the top 10 Creole words you should know."</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Make sure employees who use their skills on behalf of the agency understand that they are appreciated and valued for their unique contributions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Leadership development.</b> Another way to promote diversity and inclusion is to incorporate it into your leadership development programs. It's important to draw from all segments of your workforce in the development of your staff so that your future agency leaders are as diverse as other levels. To do this:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Enhance your mentoring program.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Widely advertise special assignment opportunities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Make sure succession planning includes a wide variety of potential leaders.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Consider making a stronger effort to develop and promote lower-graded employees rather than relying on outside recruitment to fill higher-graded vacancies. You have a wealth of talent at your entry-level positions. Tap into their potential and plan for their success by:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assigning them work or details that will contribute to their development.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Encouraging and directing them to obtain training.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Providing them with coaching and mentoring opportunities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Designing positions that allow noncompetitive promotion to higher grades as additional experience or qualifications are obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Diversity alone should not be the basis for promotion. Focus on the actual requirements of the position and how the qualifications presented by the candidates match those position requirements. This approach will ensure your adherence to the law and merit system principles. At the same time, tap into diverse pools so that people with diverse backgrounds can compete for these positions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>'Trauma-informed' management.</b> The Biden administration's Governmentwide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility Plan recommends that agencies develop work-life programs that meet the needs of the workforce and destigmatize participation in mental health, financial well-being, trauma-informed care, substance abuse, and other employee support services. Agencies are also supposed to prioritize ensuring that employees responsible for receiving, investigating, and resolving complaints are well-trained to perform their functions promptly, fairly, and in a trauma-informed manner.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">So what exactly does "trauma-informed" mean? It doesn't mean that managers need to provide trauma therapy. You shouldn't feel that you are responsible for healing employees who have suffered trauma. Many employees have suffered trauma in any number of ways: from sexual harassment or abuse to the deaths and suffering caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to the "racial reckoning" since George Floyd's death in May 2020.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You can help these employees by understanding that their response to the world in the form of poor performance or behavior at work actually makes sense due to the trauma they've experienced. You can support them in getting the help they need to get better, which in turn can make them great employees. Recognize that they aren't happy being miserable and unproductive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Handling matters in a trauma-informed manner brings needed humanity to the manager-employee relationship. Try getting to know your employees, the stressors that they face, how they're motivated, and what they hope to get out of their work life. This will also promote having a real connection to your employees beyond just productivity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Including the LGBTQ+.</b> As a manager, you should be aware of recent efforts to create a more inclusive culture for the LGBTQ+ community. The White House's "Contact Us" webpage was amended to allow individuals who identify as nonbinary to select the gender-neutral title "Mx." The drop-down menu for preferred pronouns also was amended to include she/her, he/him, they/them, other, and prefer not to share.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Since the Biden administration is taking steps to use more inclusive language on the White House website, managers may see their agencies make similar changes in the future.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In addition, Executive Order 14035 directs agency heads, in coordination with OPM, to ensure:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Existing employee support services equitably serve LGBTQ+ employees, including providing supportive services for transgender and gender non-conforming and non-binary employees who wish to legally, medically, or socially transition.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> LGBTQ+ employees, including their beneficiaries and their eligible dependents, have equitable access to health care and health insurance coverage.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> All federal employees have their respective gender identities accurately reflected and identified in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Inclusion of people with disabilities</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Ensuring your employees -- and you -- understand proper etiquette when interacting with people with disabilities is important for creating an inclusive workplace. Good disability etiquette can help your employees feel more comfortable when interacting with their coworkers with disabilities and help prevent awkward situations. It can also help your agency perform its mission more effectively.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The term "disability etiquette" refers to "respectful communication and interaction with people who have disabilities," according to the Employee Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion. EARN notes that the principles of disability etiquette are fairly simple: rely on common sense to guide your interactions with people with disabilities and behave in the same courteous and respectful way with individuals with disabilities that you would with anyone.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EARN offers several general steps for ensuring appropriate disability etiquette:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use "people first" language.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do not ask questions about a person's disability unless the individual brings it up.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If you offer assistance, wait until the offer is accepted, then listen to or ask for instructions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do not be afraid to ask questions if you are unsure what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Beyond those general recommendations, the Job Accommodation Network offers etiquette tips on its website addressing a wide range of situations:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Vision impairments</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Verbally greet and identify yourself before extending your hand to greet a person who is blind. Use the same courtesy when entering or leaving a room or saying goodbye. Do not just walk away when talking with a person who is blind or visually impaired.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Offer your arm rather than just taking the arm of a person who is blind or visually impaired. As you walk, tell the person where you are going, make note of steps and slopes, and point out obstacles, such as opening doors.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When walking alongside someone who is using a guide dog, walk on the side opposite of the animal.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Offer to read written information, where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Hearing impairments</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Because individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate in a variety of ways, pay attention to cues indicating whether the person uses sign language or is reading lips, writing, or gesturing. Do not be afraid to say you do not understand if you have difficulty understanding a person's speech.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do not put your hands in front of your face or food in your mouth when communicating with someone who is reading lips. Also, do not turn your head or walk away while talking.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When speaking with someone who is using a sign language interpreter, maintain eye contact with and direct your communication to the person who is deaf.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Speak using a normal tone of voice unless asked to raise your voice. Rephrase, rather than repeat the same words, if you are not understood.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When in a meeting or group setting, speak to one person at a time so the person who is deaf or hard of hearing can read lips if they are able to.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Mobility impairments</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do not make assumptions about the extent of a person's limitations based on the use of assistive devices -- or the lack thereof. Individuals may use a cane, walker, or wheelchair regularly or only as needed, and people who appear to be mobile may still need accommodations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do not touch or lean on a wheelchair or move a person's walker or cane without being asked to. Also, do not pet a service animal without permission. JAN explains that "a wheelchair, mobility aid, or service animal is part of an individual's personal space: an extension of that individual."</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Upon hiring a new employee with an obvious mobility impairment, offer to provide a tour so the individual can evaluate the worksite's accessible and inaccessible elements.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Ask whether a person needs assistance before helping. Do not be afraid to ask how you can help.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Sit down when speaking for more than a few minutes with a person who uses a wheelchair, so you are at eye level.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be careful about the language you use. For example, people are not "confined" or "bound" to a wheelchair. Rather, the wheelchair enables them to get where they need to go.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">In a publication titled Disability Etiquette: Tips on Interacting with People with Disabilities, the United Spinal Association added these additional tips:</p>
<ul class="bull-b1">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If it is not possible to sit at eye level, stand at a slight distance, so the person in a wheelchair is not straining their neck to make eye contact with you.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> People who use canes or crutches need their arms to balance themselves, so never grab them. People who have limited mobility may lean on a door for support as they open it. Pushing the door open from behind or unexpectedly opening the door may cause them to fall.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be aware that people who do not have a visible disability may nonetheless have needs related to their mobility. For example, a person with a respiratory or heart condition may have trouble walking long distances or walking quickly.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If you offer a seat to a person who has limited mobility, keep in mind that chairs with arms or with higher seats are easier for some people to use.</li>

<h3 class="h3">Supporting a neurodiverse workforce</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">What is neurodiversity? Neurodiversity is an inclusive concept that signals the value of people with brains that function in different ways, both neurodivergent and neurotypical. It recognizes variations in the human brain that impact sociability, learning, attention, mood, and other mental functions without applying negative connotations. Essentially, there's no one right way of thinking, learning, and behaving, and these differences should not be viewed as deficits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Neurodivergent" refers to a person whose brain functions differently in one or more ways than is considered standard or typical. Some of the most common types of neurodivergence include autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia (difficulty with reading), dyspraxia (difficulty with motor tasks), dyscalculia (difficulty with numbers), and certain mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. "Neurotypical" refers to a person who has the brain functions, behaviors, and processing considered standard or typical.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Challenges.</b> It's important to understand the challenges of your neurodiverse employees. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="bull0">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Anxiety.</b> People who are neurodivergent have been finding ways around and coping with their conditions since their school days, often putting in far more effort than their colleagues just to get to the same level. This additional pressure may manifest itself in depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Time management.</b> Many people who are neurodivergent struggle with time management. Some may enter an almost "Zen-like" state of flow when they are working and become fully immersed in a task. This can lead to the boundaries between work and home life becoming blurred, leading to even more stress and feeling overwhelmed. People with dyspraxia may have difficulty with timekeeping and planning tasks, while employees with dyslexia may have difficulty remembering instructions or managing their inboxes.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Feeling overwhelmed.</b> Sensory overload can be a problem for everyone, including those who are neurotypical. For people who are neurodivergent, it can be overwhelming. Sensory overload can be an even greater challenge for employees with neurodivergent conditions if they are parents who are having difficulty balancing childcare with their own workload.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Ways to help.</b> Here are some ways you can support your team members:</p>
<ul class="bull0">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Educate yourself about neurodivergence.</b> Understanding what challenges individual employees may be facing is the first and most important step for managers to take. This heightened awareness will allow you to be as understanding and supportive as possible of your neurodiverse staff members.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Offer accommodations.</b> Examples of accommodations that may be effective for neurodivergent employees include noise-cancelling headphones, flexible work schedules, written or recorded instructions for reference, and fragrance-free environments.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Be explicit and communicate clearly.</b> For many employees who are neurodivergent, it's particularly helpful for their manager to tell them explicitly what their workplace responsibilities are. Provide clear directions, deadlines, and feedback when assigning job duties or stating expectations for workplace procedures. When providing feedback and performance evaluations, be straightforward and offer constructive criticism.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Help set routines.</b> Help employees set routines and accommodate their preferred way of working as much as possible. Also be very clear on expectations and priorities. Talk to your team and ask them what they need and really find out what their challenges and barriers are.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Set finishing times.</b> Set absolute finish times at the end of each day for remote workers. It's easy to work after hours and lose track of time, especially for neurodivergent employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Encourage breaks.</b> Encourage employees to take proper and regular breaks away from their desks.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Create structure.</b> Help employees to set priorities and work plans ahead of time. Adding structure to the day really helps employees to focus and concentrate on the tasks at hand.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Stay in touch.</b> Set aside time to schedule occasional video calls with employees who work remotely. A video call can tell you much more than a phone call, as you can see body language and facial cues to really see how your team is doing.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Minimize interruptions.</b> Minimize the disruption of impromptu meetings to maximize employees' ability to focus on the tasks in front of them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Advancing accessibility</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">As a manager, you are responsible for your employees having what they need to be able to perform their jobs successfully, including ensuring they have access to the right resources and support. The Rehabilitation Act imposes an additional responsibility to ensure that employees and applicants with disabilities are not subjected to discrimination and are provided with reasonable accommodations that allow them to effectively perform the essential functions of their positions. Going beyond the Rehabilitation Act's statutory mandate, EO 14035 states that because a workforce that includes people with disabilities is a stronger and more effective workforce, agencies must provide an equitable, accessible, and inclusive environment for employees with disabilities. To do this, EO 14035 requires agencies to become model employers of individuals with disabilities and ensure they have access to the same benefits and privileges that employees without disabilities enjoy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>What is accessibility?</b> Under the EO, accessibility means the design, construction, development, and maintenance of facilities, information and communication technology, programs, and services so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. This includes:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Providing accessible information technologies where needed.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Providing reasonable accommodations and modifications to ensure equal access to employment, participation in activities, and access to opportunities for advancement.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reducing or eliminating physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Committing to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently access every outward-facing and internal activity or electronic space.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pursuing best practices such as universal design.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Agency responsibility for accessibility.</b> Under EO 14035, agencies must evaluate and consider Schedule A hiring guidance to enhance equitable employment opportunities and financial security for employees with disabilities with help from OPM and related agencies. Agencies also must ensure that applicants and employees with disabilities have access to information and understand their rights regarding:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Disability self-identification.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Schedule A hiring authority for individuals with disabilities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Requesting reasonable accommodations, workplace personal assistance services, and accessible information and communication technology.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency heads also must ensure:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The processes for responding to reasonable accommodation requests and appealing denials are timely and efficient.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> All information and communication technology and products are accessible and usable by employees with disabilities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> All federal office buildings and workplaces are accessible to employees with disabilities and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Accessibility of physical workplaces is maximized to reduce the need for reasonable accommodations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees receive periodic notice that complaints concerning accessibility barriers in federal buildings can be filed with the Access Board.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Talk about accessibility positively.</b> To foster a truly inclusive culture, discuss accessibility and accommodations positively, rather than as something your agency must give or do for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">People with disabilities often hesitate to ask for accommodations and choose not to self-identify because they lack trust in their leadership and fear retaliation. However, you can help your employees feel more comfortable about self-identifying if you have a disability and self-identify. Employees seeing their experience reflected in leadership is the number one thing that leads to more people self-disclosing their disabilities, according to leaders with disabilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies can help create a safe place for requesting accommodations and encourage self-disclosure by promoting accessibility and providing different resources at all levels, such as captions on movies, alt text during presentations, and accessible physical spaces. Watch for situations where additional resources would benefit your employees with disabilities and seek assistance from your disability compliance office on how to implement them.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Sustainability</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Where diversity supports a collection of individual attributes in your workforce, and inclusion calls for connecting your workforce to the agency, sustainability serves to maintain that culture. You must equip yourself with strategies and structures that will enable you to manage diversity, be accountable, measure results and refine strategies, and institutionalize a culture of inclusion. To achieve sustainability, it is critical that you:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Hold yourself accountable for leading the diversity and inclusion efforts in your workplace.</b> To ensure that you are accountable for diversity, your agency may link your performance appraisal to the progress of your diversity initiatives. Act on this responsibility in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be proactive in your efforts to understand your agency's policy and strategy toward a diverse and inclusive workforce.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Examine your own work unit and assess the level of diversity within your ranks. Review your own efforts to make your employees feel included.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be accountable for making changes. Work with HR to take an active role in your unit's diverse composition and the inclusive culture of your office.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Display your commitment to diversity and inclusion.</b> We all know that a program that is not supported by the boss will not flourish or even sustain. And while some managers may not openly express their non-support for a program, their detached actions will certainly show staff where they stand and, therefore, doom it to failure. In order for it to sustain, it's important for you to demonstrate your support and commitment to the diversity and inclusion effort of your agency. You will find that drawing on the talents and diverse perspectives of all your employees will pay huge operational dividends.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Cultivate a supportive, welcoming, inclusive, and fair environment.</b> How do you welcome new employees? Are there certain employees you're uncomfortable talking to? Are you sure that you've created a fair environment for your employees? These are the questions you should ponder in order for inclusion to thrive. Try gathering all employees in the conference room to welcome the new coworker on their first day. Make a big deal out of it. Strike up a conversation with someone who you don't ordinarily speak to. Everybody feels better when the boss expresses an interest in them. Also, make sure that your programs and procedures are transparent and fair to all employees and that they perceive them as so. This, too, will add to sustainability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Measure your progress in diversity management.</b> Sustainability efforts can be assessed through statistics in areas such as hiring, retention, promotions, EEO compliance, awards, grievances, discipline, success of talent outreach efforts, and employee affinity group accomplishments. Work with your HR, EEO, and diversity and inclusion offices to evaluate results and develop innovative strategies to sustain diversity efforts. The examination of this data is critical because you will be expected to make measurable progress in your diversity management.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Encourage, support, and become involved with diversity and inclusion training and education.</b> Put yourself at the forefront of this effort to send a clear message that diversity and inclusion training and education is something you value, and that staff should value as well. Encourage staff to become involved. For example, if your agency has a diversity and inclusion counsel or committee, support your employee's efforts to serve, and find out what you can do to be involved. Your lead to support training and educate staff can have great influence on the success of a diverse and inclusive workplace culture.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Promoting DEIA is simply good management. You can go a long way by following a few simple principles.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Indulge in actual or apparent favoritism or discrimination in employment decisions.</b> Watch out for subjective criteria in hiring.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Treat employees with disrespect.</b> Model appropriate behavior for your workforce.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore what is going on in your workforce.</b> Encourage respectful behavior and correct any form of bias or discrimination. Recognize and address inequities and lack of accessibility.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to look for and encourage the contributions of all of your employees.</b> Look beyond your usual "go to" employees to foster inclusion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Neglect to take advantage of diversity when you choose task forces, committees, and working groups, or discuss ways to serve diverse customers.</b> Be fair and even-handed in providing opportunities for professional development and promotion. Ensure these opportunities are accessible to individuals with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I do well in hiring a diverse workforce, but I have trouble retaining them. What am I doing wrong?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The answer may be inclusion. It's one thing to have a diverse workforce, but if your employees feel alienated, they'll go somewhere that fosters inclusion. Work toward changing your workplace culture. Encourage collaboration, flexibility, and fairness, and enable all employees to participate to their fullest. This will make them feel valued and connected to the workplace, and should help with retention.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does promoting diversity mean I have to pick unqualified or lesser-qualified candidates?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. The point of promoting diversity is not to force hiring managers to select unqualified people but to enlarge the pool of qualified applicants.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Some groups of employees seem to get stuck as GS-5s and GS-7s. Should I be concerned?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Diversity is harmed when some groups are represented primarily at the lower grades. There are several approaches you can take, either alone or simultaneously, depending on the reasons for the discrepancy between lower and higher grades:</p>
<p class="Body-Texth">Analyze qualifications at the higher grades (especially for education or certification) and get rid of any that aren't necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Texth">Establish training programs that give more of your lower-graded employees the chance to acquire the qualifications that allow for promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Texth">Adjust your recruitment strategies for the higher grades to attract more qualified candidates from the groups involved.</p>
<p class="Body-Texth">Your HR office can guide your analysis of the problem and help you come up with solutions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What questions do I need to avoid during employment interviews?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Avoid questions that don't focus on the candidates' qualifications, experience, and ability to perform the job. In general, questions based on assumptions tied to age, race, sex, and the like are out of bounds. Many agencies have approved interview procedures. Ask your supervisor or HR representative about the interview procedures in your agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. My agency conducts a lot of "special emphasis" events to celebrate the background and achievements of different groups. I'm always short of time. Do I really have to attend?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You should make the time, participate as actively as possible, and encourage and enable your employees to do the same. You are a manager. What you do -- and what you are seen doing -- matters to your employees. These events are a way of showing respect for the groups of employees involved, and respect is an important part of leveraging diversity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How can I leverage diversity among my existing employees?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> That will vary according to the requirements of your mission. Activities can include:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Diversity in the composition of committees, working groups, and task forces.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discussions of how to serve the needs of diverse customers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The fairness with which you make available opportunities for professional development and promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I authorized staff to send emails of interesting cultural facts during Black History Month. Am I cultivating an inclusive environment?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Sure you are. But consider taking it to the next level. You can actively demonstrate your support by sending a few emails yourself. The message will be clear that you embrace the practice and, even more important, that you endorse an inclusive environment.</p>
