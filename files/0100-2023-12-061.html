<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-61"><span class="space">1.</span> Applicants for Employment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Applicants for employment are covered by the plain terms of Title VII. 42 USC 2000e-16. The same is true for the Rehabilitation Act, the ADEA, and GINA. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR 1614.103(c). A person who applies for a position with a federal agency and is denied that position has standing to bring a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">For certain classes of positions, the Office of Personnel Management makes determinations about the pool of qualified candidates who officially may become applicants for the position<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 5 CFR Part 300. These persons have standing to file an EEO complaint if they believe they have been discriminated against in the screening process. In such cases, OPM, not the actual employing agency, is the proper defendant because only OPM can grant the necessary relief. <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01792105 (1981). For more instruction, see section on "<span class="blue">Agency Jurisdiction</span>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, a complaint that an agency has prevented a person from becoming an applicant for employment is within the purview of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Ficken v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01880655 (1988) (concerning an allegation that the agency filled a vacancy without announcing it and kept the appointment secret).</p>
<p class="noindent">There are times when an agency's selection records leave something to be desired. To state a claim for relief, a complainant is not required to conclusively prove that he applied for the position. If the complainant asserts he applied for the position and submits some evidence of that fact, he is sufficiently aggrieved to state a claim and the agency should investigate the case on the merits. <span class="Italic">Murray v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01933990 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The method of application is not relevant to a determination of whether the complainant is an applicant for agency employment. In <span class="Italic">Osman v. International Development Agency</span>, 0120080348 (2008), the agency argued that the complainant was not an applicant for employment because the solicitation for the position was done through a private company. The Commission found that the complainant, if hired, would have received a three-year contract with three one-year renewal options. In addition, the position was a management position, was supervised by agency employees, and performed core agency functions. The Commission further noted that the contract for the position offered fringe benefits not generally available to contractors. As a result, the Commission held that the complainant was an applicant for employment with the agency entitled to use federal sector complaint procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Porter v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120081465 (2008), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant was not applicant for employment because he had not submitted an on-line application and his paper application was not in a format that could be scanned into the electronic system. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Porter</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant argues for the reversal of the FAD. In response to the appeal, the agency argues that the complainant does not state a claim because complainant should not be considered an applicant. It argues that the agency's standard business practice is to accept applications through a web-based electronic submission process using Resumix, and while it can accept a paper resume, it must be in a specific format so it can be scanned into the Resumix System. It contended that complainant's paper application did not use the proper format. The agency argues that an applicant is an individual who has followed the employer's standard procedures for submitting applications. It argues that because complainant did not follow its standard procedures, he is not an applicant and hence his complaint fails to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_176"></span>As an initial matter, we are unpersuaded by the agency's argument that complainant lacked standing because he was not an applicant for employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Beth G. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120161015 (2016), the Commission applied the <span class="Italic">Ma</span> factors to determine whether a joint employer relationship existed regarding an applicant. In that case, the complainant applied for a nurse practitioner position with a third party, CR Associates, Inc., which contracted with the VA to provide health care resources. CR Associates notified the complainant that her application was incomplete because she had not submitted a "declaration of health," which required a doctor's examination. The complainant agreed to submit to an examination upon receipt of a committed offer of employment. The credentialing process was ended, and the complainant was not considered for the position. The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, because the complainant was an applicant of CR Associates, not of the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Beth G.</span> disagreed, relying heavily on the agency's "credentialing" process as evidence of agency control over the complainant's employment and further chastised the agency for its pre-offer medical examination requirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the instant appeal considers the Agency's dismissal due to Complainant's alleged lack of standing, we cannot ignore the Agency alleged actions relating to a pre-offer medical examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers may evaluate whether an applicant is qualified for a job in question by, for example, asking about an applicant's ability to perform specific job functions or by asking applicants to describe or demonstrate how they would perform the job's tasks. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (Oct. 10, 1995) (web version) ("1995 Enforcement Guidance"), at 2. Under the Rehabilitation Act, however, "an employer may ask disability-related questions and require medical examinations of an applicant only after the applicant has been given a conditional job offer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13(a). As this Commission has explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the past, some employment applications and interviews requested information about an applicant's physical and/or mental condition. This information was often used to exclude applicants with disabilities before their ability to perform the job was even evaluated. For example, applicants may have been asked about their medical conditions at the same time that they were engaging in other parts of the application process, such as completing a written job application or having references checked. If an applicant was then rejected, s/he did not necessarily know whether s/he was rejected because of disability, or because of insufficient skills or experience or a bad report from a reference. As a result, Congress established a process...to isolate an employer's consideration of an applicant's medical condition.... Under the law, an employer may not ask disability-related questions and may not conduct medical examinations until after it makes a conditional job offer to the applicant. This helps ensure that an applicant's possible hidden disability (including a prior history of a disability) is not considered before the employer evaluates an applicant's non-medical qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant argues that she was "excluded from becoming an employee by the actions of the [Agency] requiring a physical prior to an offer of employment." Specifically, Complainant asserts that it was the Agency which "made the demand for a pre-offer physical and CR Associates withdrew [her] application for failure to acquire such, rending both [CR Associates and the Agency] potentially responsible for this act of discrimination." When Complainant responded to the allegedly unlawful request by asking for a description of the physical requirements of the position and a "committed offer," she was informed that her credentialing would not continue. In this case, we find that the nature of the Agency's allegedly discriminatory actions themselves reflect a level of control held by a joint employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant's position to qualify as her employer for the purpose of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Lorita A. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2021004328 (2021), found that an offer of reemployment from the agency did not convert the complainant into an "applicant" for employment. The complainant, in that case, alleged disability discrimination and reprisal when the agency withdrew its offer of reemployment. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for failure to state a claim, finding that the offer was made during settlement negotiations in a prior complaint. The complainant maintained that the agency's offer was a "<span class="Italic">Ford</span>" offer and the withdraw of that offer constituted reprisal. The agency conceded that it was a "<span class="Italic">Ford</span>" offer, but argued that the withdraw of same could not support an independent cause of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that the Agency's job offer was not made in good faith. Complainant reasons that the Agency made a "<span class="Italic">Ford</span>" reemployment offer to limit the amount of backpay the Agency would be responsible for providing related to another formal complaint Complainant filed. In <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC</span>, 458 U.S. 219 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court held that an employer charged with discrimination in hiring under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 can toll the continuing accrual of backpay liability under Section 706(g) of Title VII by unconditionally offering the claimant the job previously denied, and is not required to offer seniority retroactive to the date of the alleged discrimination. Consequently, the rejection of an employer's unconditional offer ends the accrual of potential backpay liability. Here, Complainant asserts that the Agency withdrew the <span class="Italic">Ford</span> offer out of retaliation after Complainant failed to reject the offer and attempted to cooperatively work with the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Agency concedes that the AJ incorrectly stated that the job offer was provided as a settlement between Complainant and the Agency. However, the Agency agrees that the reemployment offer was indeed a <span class="Italic">Ford</span> offer used to mitigate any back or front pay potentially resulting from a finding of liability in Complainant's previously filed EEO complaint. The Agency argues this Commission has long held that a separate EEO complaint relating to an agency's legal defense of an existing complaint constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on the other adjudication and thus fails to state an actionable discrimination/retaliation claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission agreed that, based on the facts of this case, the withdraw did not create a viable cause of action. Nor did the offer convert the complainant into an "applicant" for purposes of standing in <span class="Italic">Lorita A</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant had not worked for the Agency for over five years when the job offer was rescinded. While Complainant argues on appeal that she had standing to file an EEO complaint over this matter because she was an "applicant" for employment, we conclude that the weight of the evidence does not support this conclusion. Instead, we find that rather than being an applicant, the offer of reemployment was, in fact, a <span class="Italic">Ford</span> offer provided by the Agency as part of its legal strategy while defending itself during the hearing process in her prior complaint (Agency No. EU-FY08-044).3 Both parties concede that the September 26, 2016 reemployment offer was an unconditional offer. Additionally, both parties have indicated that the purpose of this offer was to mitigate front and/or backpay liability by the Agency in her earlier complaint. Despite Complainant's counsel's statements on appeal, the record reflects that Complainant's counsel also considered the reemployment offer as a way to mitigate the Agency's potential liability in Agency No. EU-FY08-044 when he wrote in in an October 11, 2016 letter to the Agency that, "[Complainant] also has a claim for front pay. We understand that the Agency is currently attempting to mitigate this economic harm by seeking to reemploy [Complainant] with an accommodation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has long held that an allegation of discrimination and/or unlawful retaliation directly stemming from an agency's legal defense of a previously filed EEO complaint fails to state an independent actionable claim and is properly dismissed under either 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), as a collateral attack on the adjudicatory processing of the prior complaint, or under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(8), as an allegation of dissatisfaction with the processing of the previously filed complaint. <span class="Italic">See Appleby v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933897 (March 4, 1994) (affirming dismissal of a complaint alleging agency counsel submitted false answers to interrogatory questions); <span class="Italic">Colonna v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960347 (September 10, 1996) (affirming dismissal of claim concerning agency counsel conduct); <span class="Italic">Ming-Chiang v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986508 (August 31, 2001) (failure to state an actionable claim for actions taken by agency counsel in proceedings in an earlier complaint); <span class="Italic">Virgilio v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120172046 (February 8, 2018) (claim of reprisal when Agency counsel breached confidentiality during litigation of previously filed complaint properly dismissed under 1614.107(a)(8)); <span class="Italic">Nerissa v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120172858 (December 12, 2018) (dismissal appropriate under 1614.107(a)(8) when Agency counsel allegedly withheld evidence during the adjudication of previously filed complaint); <span class="Italic">Gryder v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091598 (June 10, 2010) (absolute privilege for statements made by Agency counsel during judicial or administrative proceeding). <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941906 (July 7, 1995) (damages are not recoverable for injuries resulting from participation in the EEO complaint process), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950919 (Feb. 15, 1996). In sum, we conclude that the offer of reemployment at issue here was an acceptable litigation strategy on the part of the Agency to limit its potential liability in the adjudication of Agency No. EU-FY08-044. By the same token, its decision to rescind that offer upon obtaining new information was also a defensive move by the Agency in its litigation mode and not an independent employment action by the Agency as an employer. As such, we conclude that the claim was properly dismissed as an independent claim giving rise to a new EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, while the offer of reemployment made here was not an offer of settlement, we note that settlement negotiations, including any statements or proposals, are treated as confidential and privileged to <span id="Page_177"></span>facilitate settlement between the parties and cannot form the basis of an independent claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Green v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980207 (1998) (Complainant alleged he was discriminated against when management withdrew an offer of a supervisory position made during settlement negotiations. The Commission affirmed the dismissal of the allegation for failure to state a claim). We are persuaded by the Agency's argument that the same rationale that protects actions during settlement negotiations should also be extended to reinstatement offers made in the Ford mitigation context. If withdrawal of a Ford reinstatement offer based on new relevant information is deemed impermissible, agencies may be reluctant to make them in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, we find the AJ properly dismissed this complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) and (8).</p>
