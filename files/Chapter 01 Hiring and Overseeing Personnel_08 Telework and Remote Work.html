<h2 class="h2">TELEWORK AND REMOTE WORK</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Telework has existed in the federal government for many years. Since the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 became law, agencies have demonstrated that telework is an efficient and effective way of working to deliver on agency missions. The importance of a robust telework program became readily apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced even more adoption of telework as an important tool for safely and efficiently delivering mission-critical services during both short- and long-term emergencies. Remote work -- an arrangement that doesn't require employees to regularly return to the agency worksite during each pay period -- also has become more widely used as a strategy to assist agencies' in fulfilling their missions and attract and retain and talented and skilled workforce.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Telework</b> is a work arrangement that allows employees to have regularly scheduled days on which they telework and regularly scheduled days when they work in their agency worksite. This includes any arrangement where an employee conducts work activities during any regular, paid hours, from an alternative location mutually agreeable to the employee and the agency, such as the employee's home or some other telework site.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Telework has also been used by agencies as part of their Continuity of Operations Plans. COOPs provide procedures to allow agencies to continue operating even when their regular worksites are closed or disrupted by severe weather or other emergencies, such as health or safety concerns.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Remote work</b> is an alternative work arrangement that involves an employee performing their official duties at an approved alternative worksite away from an agency worksite, without regularly returning to the agency worksite during each pay period. This HR management tool can be utilized to recruit and retain high-quality talent from geographically dispersed labor markets, reduce costs associated with real estate, and optimize performance and productivity through practices that help agencies sustain continuity of operations when one location is adversely affected by an emergency event.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Telework and remote work can help employees balance work and personal responsibilities and make use of beneficial work environments, thereby enhancing employee satisfaction and wellbeing, aiding retention, and serving as a draw to potential applicants. Therefore, use of these arrangements makes good business sense by enhancing government efficiency while making life better for federal workers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Dispelling 3 myths about working at home</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">As a manager, you may be uneasy about teleworking employees. You may feel that if they're not in the office, they may be slacking off or susceptible to distractions in the home. This is a common concern for managers and unfortunately, it can serve as a barrier for success. Here are three common concerns by managers about employees working at home:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. Distractions.</b> You're concerned that teleworking employees are too susceptible to distractions at home. However, distractions are also likely to occur at work. Annoying coworkers, extreme office temperatures, unexpected phone calls, and impromptu meetings are just as distracting as children, pets, and telemarketers. The difference is that teleworkers can set boundaries and manage home distractions much easier than those over which they have no control in your workplace. The added advantage for teleworking employees is that they can address any issue that may arise in their home environment and instantly return to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. Productivity.</b> Another concern is that there is no way to tell if an employee is actually working while at home. Unless you're standing over the shoulders of your non-teleworking employees in your workplace, you should have the same concerns about them. Don't assume that someone who is present and looks busy is actually accomplishing more work than someone who is not on-site. If you shift your focus to the work product instead of the work activity, you will be better able to monitor the accomplishment of your employees' duties. Communicating clear expectations is key for all employees, regardless of whether they telework or not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>3. Care of family members.</b> Managers may feel that telework is just another way for employees to stay home and get paid to tend to the needs of family members. While the need to care for family members is not uncommon, employees are not permitted to do so while engaged in the performance of official duties. When making a determination about telework eligibility of an employee who is caring for a family member, the focus should remain on the work and the ability of the employee to perform official duties without interruption for specified periods of time, not on the proximity of the elderly or infirm family member in the home. You can strike a balance in these situations, so they should be examined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Features of telework</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Let's first take a look at some of the important details you should know about telework.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Who is eligible?</b> There is no specific definition of an eligible employee, and each federal agency can establish its own policies on who can telework and under what circumstances. But under the law, all agency employees must be notified of their eligibility status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies should make sure the process and criteria used to make decisions about who may telework are written down, applied equitably and consistently, and as transparent as possible. The criteria for their decisions should be detailed in the agency policies (and may also be covered in applicable collective bargaining agreements, which should be applied in accordance with law and governmentwide regulation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note these points:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees otherwise eligible may not telework if they have been subjected to discipline for being absent without permission for more than five days in any calendar year or for viewing, downloading, or exchanging pornography.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Eligible employees must also complete telework training and sign written agreements with their managers governing their specific work arrangement before they may telework.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees must be excluded from telework if their duties require them -- during every work day -- to handle classified materials or to perform duties that may not be performed at alternate worksites.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an agency decides eligibility, you are called upon to make judgments about the eligibility of your employees according to your agency's criteria.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Types and conditions of telework.</b> There are two categories of telework:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Routine telework in which telework occurs as part of an ongoing regular schedule.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Situational telework in which telework is approved on a case-by-case basis and the hours worked were not part of a previously approved, ongoing, and regular telework schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Here's a comparison of the features of routine and situational telework to help you better understand the differences.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Telework is subject to these key conditions:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="bulla">&#x2022;</span> It is not an entitlement.</p>

<p class="list"><span class="bulla">&#x2022;</span> Because it is official duty, teleworkers are covered by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act in the event of injury.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Features of remote work</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Remote work is an alternative work arrangement that involves an employee performing their official duties at an approved alternative worksite away from an agency worksite, without regularly returning to the agency worksite during each pay period. Because remote work is a different type of arrangement than telework -- which you're likely more familiar with -- let's take a look at some of its distinguishing features.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>No entitlement to remote work.</b> A remote work arrangement is not an employee right or entitlement. Agencies have the discretion to support or deny any request for remote work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You should make remote work determinations based on the nature of required job tasks and duties to help maximize equity and make it easier for your agency to explain why some people have certain options available to them based on what they do.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Eligibility.</b> Agencies retain both the discretion to decide whether to offer remote work, and, if so, the authority to determine employee eligibility for remote work subject to business-related operational needs. Any management decisions regarding remote work eligibility and participation should focus on the performance standards for the position and methods for making sure performance against those standards can continue to be accurately assessed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Subject to the requirements and limitations of the law, agencies have discretion to determine the eligibility criteria for employees who are approved for remote work arrangements. The criteria should be detailed in agency policy and may also be covered in applicable collective bargaining agreements, to the extent consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because agencies are not required to permit remote arrangements at all, they may be selective about who is permitted to do remote work, may impose conditions on granting it, and may approach approvals on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Promising candidates.</b> Employees who are self-directed and require minimal supervision are good candidates for a remote work arrangement. Additionally, while such employees must be able to work independently, they must also be responsive to the organization, team, and customers. That means keeping a high profile (not out of sight, out of mind), keeping supervisors and coworkers informed about the status of projects pending and completed, and pitching in to help when needed. They should also be comfortable not having day-to-day contact with colleagues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Training.</b> Your agency should have training requirements for remote work arrangements that are at least as rigorous as training provided to teleworkers, with any additional training that the agency believes is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Official worksite.</b> Remote work arrangements in which a General Schedule or other employee covered by Title 5 locality pay, special rates, and nonforeign area cost-of-living allowances does not report to the agency worksite at least twice each biweekly pay period on a regular recurring basis (and for which a temporary exception to this requirement has not been approved), will require a documented change in official worksite to the alternative worksite.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depending on the location, this change may impact the employee's pay and the agency's budget -- positively or negatively. The change in official worksite thus may be a significant consideration when deciding to approve or deny a remote work arrangement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Severance pay.</b> When a remote work arrangement is initiated at the request of an employee for personal reasons, you should consult with your HR office and legal counsel to revise the position description that will apply, once remote work begins, to provide for potential reassignment in the event the employee's performance diminishes and to state that any such reassignment will not be considered involuntary. This will preclude a severance payment if the employee chooses to separate instead of accepting the reassignment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Work schedules.</b> Work schedules for remote employees should be clearly defined with established working hours, core business hours, and, if applicable within the agency-specific policy, flexible time bands within which an employee may vary their arrival and departure from the work site.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Travel and relocation benefits.</b> Remote workers may be entitled to receive travel and relocation benefits under the Federal Travel Regulation, depending on their location. When considering remote work arrangements, especially remote work that occurs outside the local commuting area of the agency worksite, you must take into consideration how often the employee needs to physically come into the agency worksite.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a remote worker lives within 50 miles of the office location, then temporary duty and relocation benefits will not apply. However, the employee could be reimbursed for local travel costs based on agency policy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Workers' compensation.</b> Employees who work remotely are covered by Federal Employees' Compensation Act whether they are working at home or at a satellite government office. In a home office (whether the home office is local or outside the commuting area where they are assigned organizationally), the employee is covered under FECA at their workstation while performing assigned duties or performing employment activities incident to those duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Injuries sustained while performing activities that are not immediately directed toward the actual performance of assigned duties are not covered. Unlike a traditional office setting, employees remove themselves from the performance of assigned duties as soon as they walk away from their workstation to use the bathroom, get a cup of coffee, or seek fresh air.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Labor relations.</b> Changing an employee's status to or from a remote worker could affect their bargaining unit coverage. The employee's status depends on the bargaining unit's description found in the Certification of Representative issued by the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Reduction in force</b>. The presence of remote workers -- especially those who may be located in a different geographical area -- in an agency's workforce may affect how the minimum competitive area is structured in connection with a reduction in force. If an agency wants to redefine a competitive area within 90 days of the RIF effective date, the agency must obtain OPM's approval for the change.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Managing performance</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">There is much involved in successful telework and remote work management that is probably outside your area of responsibility such as security, technology and CBA provisions. However, performance management is your direct supervisory responsibility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Manage effectively.</b> Effective performance management is important to the success of telework and remote work programs. Your agency's telework and remote work policies must provide that an employee may not be authorized to telework or remote work if their performance does not comply with the terms of the telework or remote work agreement. Managers also have an obligation to ensure that telework or remote work does not diminish employee performance or agency operations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When implementing the agency telework program, you should keep in mind that performance standards for teleworking and remote working employees must be the same as performance standards for non-teleworking employees. Also, management expectations for performance should be clearly addressed in each employee's performance plan, regardless of whether or not they are a teleworker or remote worker.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an employee participates in telework or remote work, your expectations about accountability should not differ by virtue of the telework or remote work arrangement. Following clear and consistent performance management principles and techniques should result in a successful transition for you and your employees who move to telework and remote work arrangements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Recency bias and distance bias.</b> When it comes to assigning work and evaluating efforts, don't fall prey to recency bias and distance bias. "Recency bias" refers to the likelihood that managers favor employees who are in more constant communication with them. "Distance bias" refers to the tendency to favor those employees who are in closer proximity to their managers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Be aware of how you're assigning high-priority projects because you're often thinking in terms of the last three to six weeks for what you remember about performance, accomplishment, and impact. Make sure to have regular check-ins with your employees and equip them to be able to communicate and summarize their ongoing contributions over the long haul.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Special considerations for remote workers.</b> To some degree, remote work may pose greater challenges for effective performance management of remote workers. To successfully navigate within the structures and procedures of a fully virtual work environment, you need to be more deliberate about how and when you communicate with employees who rarely report to the office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You also must understand how to measure and account for performance against established performance standards for the position while building connections with employees when you cannot see them. Effective communication with remote workers can help to establish an environment of trust and accountability while still giving employees a feeling of independence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency should provide you with training on fair and equitable performance management for hybrid teams, but one thing you should be aware of in this area is that evaluation of an employee's performance should be based on factors such as accountability for results or quality of the work. It should not be affected by whether an employee is working in the office, teleworking, based remotely, or working a flexible work schedule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Additionally, it's important that you maintain open lines of communication and provide all employees with objective feedback regarding performance expectations. Any decisions you make regarding remote work eligibility and participation should focus on the performance standards for the position and methods for making sure performance against those standards can continue to be accurately assessed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Focus on results.</b> How do you improve your performance management techniques? Experts suggest a strong focus on results. You should know -- or be able to find out -- what you may reasonably expect your employees to produce, how long it should take, and what the quality should be. After all, these expectations form the basis of any reasonable performance plan and performance appraisal, wherever an employee works.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you concentrate on these results, you should be able to determine whether or not a teleworker or remote worker is meeting your expectations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If your expectations are not met, you must take steps, as you would with any employee. Normal problems with equipment and software, access to data, communication with coworkers, customers, and others (including you) may be magnified by the telework or remote work situation. You can find out what the challenges are by discussing the performance situation with your employee and working jointly on solutions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You may have to adjust your expectations, work out new arrangements, or both. But ultimately, a teleworking employee should be at least as productive as a non-teleworking colleague. You may have to adjust your supervisory style somewhat to establish a clear basis for mutual trust.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Matter of trust.</b> The foundation of a successful program is trust between management and employees. To build this trust, you should:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Manage by results, not micromanage based on face time in the office.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Clearly communicate goals and set expectations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Establish interim and final due dates for projects.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Identify sources employees can turn to for assistance.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Plan work assignments carefully.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Review interim products to ensure expectations are being met.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Monitor productivity and performance of teleworkers and remote workers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Effectively communicate to ensure teleworkers and remote workers are kept up to date on critical office information.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Make sure teleworkers are connecting as they should with coworkers, customers, and others with whom they must cooperate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">But trust is a two-way street. Teleworkers and remote workers must:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Work their core office and telework/remote work hours.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Plan ahead to make sure they have all materials to do assignments.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Prioritize assignments more carefully.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Work efficiently and be at least as productive as they would be in the office.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Multitask and deal with nonwork-related distractions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Meet interim and final deadlines.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Collaborate with others when necessary.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Keep others informed of the status of their work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Learn to say "no" to distractions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Request leave as appropriate when drawn away from their work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee cannot or will not live up to the level of trust required, you may have to consult HR and higher management, and either adjust or terminate the telework or remote work arrangement.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Driving performance and engagement</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Now, let's focus on more specific actions you can take to drive high levels of performance and engagement from your employees. OPM has issued guidance outlining general strategies you can utilize in a hybrid workplace, for in-office, remote, and teleworking employees. We've also included additional steps you can take to help maximize performance and engagement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Planning.</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Clarify the intent and meaning of performance standards for your employees. Individual perspectives can vary in their interpretation of what constitutes an exceeds, meets, and below performance.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Standardize expected results where possible. This helps increase the equity of the performance standards among employees in similar positions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Enable autonomy and growth by clearly highlighting for employees how their work aligns with the organizational mission.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Plan work assignments carefully, working with employees to set specific goals and a realistic timeline. Also make sure teleworkers and remote workers have all materials necessary to carry out their assignments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Open communication.</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> For in-office employees, encourage teamwork/collaboration and team check-ins by scheduling 5-10-minute breaks during meetings for "hallway" chats among employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Utilize technology such as video conferencing to help maintain an "in-person" connection amongst in-office, remote, and teleworking employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be deliberate and consistent in communication methods and channels. People need to feel they are accepted as part of the group. Don't give up on virtual meetings and informal in-office interactions; they are more valuable to employee morale than you may realize.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Make sure to clearly communicate goals and set expectations. Also establish interim and final due dates for projects to check progress along the way and avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Effectively communicate with teleworkers and remote workers to ensure they are kept up-to-date on critical office information. Make sure teleworkers and remote workers are connecting as they should with coworkers, customers, and others with whom they must cooperate. Also work with them to carefully prioritize assignments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Learning and development.</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Implement routine check-ins for two-way and 360-degree assessments. These feedback sessions should be bi-directional -- that is, from manager to employee and from employee to manager -- and encourage constant development.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Offer and encourage online learning and free training programs from other agencies, job-specific associations, and local universities or partners.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Establish or promote mentoring, coaching, and detail opportunities to link employee goals and development.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">You can also identify other sources employees can turn to for assistance, based on the specific circumstances of a project or issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Monitoring.</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Demonstrate inclusion to employees through thoughtfully providing performance feedback using inclusive language.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Engage employees through multiple informal and formal feedback sessions throughout the year.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Don't jump to conclusions (especially if your employee has been working remotely) about why an employee has or hasn't been performing acceptably. There may be unseen circumstances and events impacting the employee's performance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">You should also manage by results, not micromanage based on face time in the office. Review interim products to ensure your employees are meeting expectations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Rating.</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Hold performance evaluation meetings in a neutral environment free of noise and distraction (in both virtual and physical environments).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Begin with positive feedback; constructive feedback is more easily accepted by employees if you've prefaced it with positive feedback.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be cognizant of your own rater bias. Evaluate performance based on measurable results, not on any conscious or unconscious biases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Rewards and recognition.</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Ask your employees about how they want to receive recognition and meet that need. Some are not comfortable with public acknowledgment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Recognize employee contributions tied to organizational values -- not just productivity and performance.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Celebrate individual and team success throughout the year, not just at annual evaluation time. People want to feel appreciated and know they are contributing to the success of the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Dependent care</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">If you've ever wondered about the reason some employees request a telework or remote work arrangement, it's a safe bet that many of them have caregiving responsibilities at home. Telework and remote work are just two of several dependent care options that employees may use to ensure close proximity to children or adults requiring care. These arrangements are not a substitute for dependent care, but they can be very valuable flexibilities to employees with caregiving responsibilities by eliminating time required to commute and expanding their choices about dependent care.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You should think of teleworkers and remote workers just as you do in-office staff. All workplace policies remain in place, including work start/end times, rules regarding time and attendance, and employee expectations concerning performance and conduct. Teleworkers and remote workers should request approval for appropriate leave if they need time to handle dependent care responsibilities, just as they would if they were in your workplace.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you become aware that a dependent is in the household of a teleworker or remote worker, it should not automatically prohibit them from participation in the telework or remote work program. Your focus should be on results and performance management. While an occasional, brief interruption may occur when a dependent is present in the home, teleworkers and remote workers must be careful to keep interruptions to a minimum because they can disrupt the accomplishment of their work. If you make it clear to your employees that they cannot telework or remote work with the intent or sole purpose of meeting their dependent care responsibilities while performing official duties, it should not pose a problem.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the event that the care of a dependent does prevent or significantly disrupts work accomplishment, workers should notify you as soon as possible about the situation. They should then request approval for appropriate leave while performing dependent care responsibilities. Failure to comply with the terms of the telework agreement or deterioration in an employee's performance could result in suspension or even termination of the employee's telework agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Maxi flex schedule.</b> A maxi flex schedule is a work schedule that allows employees to balance caregiving responsibilities and work responsibilities throughout an entire day. If your agency has adopted the option of using a maxi flex schedule, you may work with a teleworker or remote worker to come up with a plan for how the employee can complete a full workday while attending to dependent care responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A maxi flex schedule provides employees with greater work scheduling flexibility than is provided under a traditional eight-hour daily schedule, which requires the use of paid leave -- such as annual leave -- to account for non-work periods during the employee's workday. For example, instead of requiring the employee to work 10 workdays in a biweekly pay period, you could vary the length of the work week and permit longer hours on fewer days to further assist the employee with caregiving responsibilities, rather than having to forego caregiving responsibilities or take annual leave to comply with the strictures of a traditional eight-hour schedule or throughout an entire pay period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Temporary short-term workplace flexibility.</b> Your employees may experience unexpected situations for which temporary teleworking may be a solution. If, for example, schools close due to inclement weather, telework may be a fitting short-term workplace flexibility for employees with children. These short-term temporary circumstances should be the exception and not the rule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Provided the employee has a telework agreement in place and is telework-ready, your agency benefits in these situations because:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee may accomplish at least some of their duties from the telework site instead of taking off the entire day.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> It demonstrates your agency's support of a healthy work-life balance.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Telework flexibility supports continuity of operations and mission accomplishment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Recruitment, retention, and employee engagement are positively affected.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> It develops higher morale.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Increased levels of child or elder care may require more communication between you and your employee about possible flexible work options such as a change in work schedule or the use of leave. While occasionally permitting employees to telework on a short-term basis is OK, stay focused on good performance management and adhere to the telework policy in a fair and consistent manner.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Different geographic location.</b> Telework provides employees the flexibility to better manage their work, family, and personal responsibilities. It could be used temporarily from a different geographic location if such temporary arrangements are permitted under your agency's telework policy. An authorized agency official has the discretion to grant an exception to the physical reporting requirement on a temporary basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of an appropriate situation might be an employee's need to spend time away from their work site to help attend to a health crisis involving an elderly family member in a different geographic location. As with any arrangement involving work at an alternative work site, work from a temporary location away from an employee's official work site should be accompanied by a written agreement that spells out expectations. This exception is intended for temporary arrangements. Any short-term need that becomes extended should trigger a reassessment by you. You'll need to determine if the employee is to return to their duty station or if you're willing to have the employee continue to perform work in the different location as a remote worker. Serving as a remote worker has implications for the employee's official work site.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again, an employee may not care for a family member while engaged in the performance of official duties. The focus should remain on the work and the ability of the employee to perform official duties without interruption for specified periods of time. The focus should not be on the proximity of the elderly family member in the home. Examine each situation on a case-by-case basis when making your decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Childbirth, adoption, or foster care.</b> Telework can also be useful to employees during the period following childbirth, adoption, or foster care. A telework arrangement can be used when an employee transitions back to work after the birth of a child. Telework is often used in conjunction with leave during the transition period between childbirth and the return to full-time official duties. The telework arrangement that you approve must conform to your agency telework policy and be based on the ability of the employee to accomplish their work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Childbirth recovery.</b> A formal written telework agreement that summarizes expectations should be executed for telework related to an employee's recovery from childbirth or to care for a family member recovering from childbirth and transitioning back to work. Such telework agreements should, for example, outline a work schedule that indicates the days and hours of the week the employee will be working, outline any additional requirements (e.g., technology needs) beyond those specified by law, clarify any assumptions regarding frequency and modes of communication (e.g., email vs. telephone, core hours of contact, speed or expected time frame for returning calls and emails), and establish terms under which the agreement can be modified or terminated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may not care for a newborn while engaged in the performance of official duties. However, when making a determination about telework eligibility following childbirth, the focus should remain on the work and the ability of the employee to perform official duties, not on the proximity of the newborn in the home. Decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Nursing mothers.</b> Just as the Affordable Care Act requires federal agencies to provide nursing mothers in your workplace with a reasonable break time to express breast milk for their children up to one year after the child's birth, this rule also applies to employees working at an approved alternative work site.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While the law does not require agencies to compensate nursing mothers for breaks taken for the purpose of expressing milk, many agencies already provide compensated breaks of 15 minutes in the morning and afternoon that employees can use for any purpose. A teleworking employee who uses that break time to express milk must be compensated in the same way that other employees are compensated for such break time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Keep in mind that OPM urges agencies to support all nursing mothers to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Performance management.</b> You must hold teleworkers and remote workers to the same performance standards as non-teleworking employees. Poor performance cannot be excused because the employee had to care for their children or an adult dependent while they were teleworking. It's important to maintain open lines of communication and to provide all employees with objective feedback regarding performance expectations, including work outputs completed in the office or at an alternative work site. Any management decisions regarding telework and remote work eligibility and participation should focus on effective performance management and accountability measurement principles that are clearly addressed in the employee's performance plan.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ensure that you and your employees understand your agency's specific telework and remote work policies, training requirements, and agreements, as well as any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Many workplace flexibilities offered by your agency can also be used in conjunction with your telework and remote work programs.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Reasonable accommodation</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Rehabilitation Act, agencies must accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified applicant or employee with a disability, unless the agency can show the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allowing an eligible individual with a disability to work at home may be a form of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether telework is a reasonable accommodation for a specific employee with a disability is a fact-specific question and the following should be examined:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The disability usually needs to be documented with medical records, unless it's apparent.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The agency must make an eligibility determination regarding the specific job and the specific employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> It has to be clear that teleworking will allow the employee with a disability to meet the essential functions of their job.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If the determination is made that a position is NOT eligible for telework, the job must be examined to see if it can be modified in a nonessential way so that an employee with a disability could do it as a teleworker. For example, if the job requires face-to-face interactions with coworkers, could that be handled through phone calls or audioconferencing? It could be that presence in the office isn't really an essential function of the job. Your EEO office will help you make these assessments. The law requires that an individualized assessment be made, rather than saying an employee with a disability can't telework simply because they hold a particular title or job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Fair treatment.</b> It's imperative that you treat teleworkers the same as your in-office workers. You can't pile on extra reporting or check-in requirements just because they work from home. And you can't skip over them for assignments or promotions that they are qualified for and capable of handling just because they telework or just because they have a disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Discipline.</b> The EEOC has said that taking away a telework accommodation isn't usually a suitable way to discipline a teleworker. The discipline should be similar to what an in-office worker would receive as discipline for a similar offense. For example, let's say a teleworker mismanages an agency credit card by charging personal items on it and not paying the bill in a timely manner. Appropriate discipline may include taking away the credit card. But taking away the telework accommodation is probably not appropriate. That's because the Rehabilitation Act entitles the employee to a reasonable accommodation that enables them to do their job. Taking away the accommodation basically takes away the job.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Recording audio or video</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">With so many employees teleworking, many are asking whether conversations or meetings can be recorded under the law and related agency policies. Current laws, however, have not kept up with technological advancements and the increase in the use of telework and remote work. As a manager, you should understand that determining whether employees may record an audio or video meeting will rest on the interaction between agency policies, relevant state law, and federal law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency policy may allow disciplining employees for violating a ban on recording meetings or conversations, but a thorough analysis of the relevant state, federal, and case law is required before pursuing such an action. This means you must work with HR and/or legal counsel to determine whether you can pursue discipline for such recordings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if your agency has policies banning such recordings, state law often decides whether such recordings are legal. At the same time, most courts have found that if the recording is to enforce or participate in a protected activity under federal law, then federal law should prevail, although some courts disagree.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are some key areas to know when considering discipline for an employee who violated an agency policy on recording meetings:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. Know the relevant state law.</b> Twelve states prohibit surreptitious recordings unless all parties consent, including Maryland and Pennsylvania. In contrast, the District of Columbia and Virginia do not require both parties to consent. Employees who violate these state laws could face criminal charges, so they should consult counsel before recording any meetings. Yet, the 12 states with two-party consent laws typically prohibit audio recording but generally do not prohibit video recordings without audio. So, in theory, a video only recording would not violate state law if the statutes do not cover video, according to some experts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. Check your agency's policy.</b> Many agencies have policies preventing recording conversations or meetings, either on agency property or when going about agency business. If your agency prohibits such recordings, regardless of the relevant state law, most likely you can charge the employee with failure to follow instructions, insubordination, or something similar, as opposed to specifically charging failure follow the policy banning the recording. However, in two-party consent states, case law shows that employees also can face criminal charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>3. Be aware of rights under federal law.</b> Under the whistleblower protection laws, federal employees who want to make a recording for the purpose of documenting a violation of law, rule, or policy have some protection under Supreme Court precedence. However, arguing that federal law protects the individual even though the employer has a policy against tape recording is less likely to be successful in a two-party consent state like Maryland. The same is true for recordings that evidence discrimination protected under federal law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Blanket policies.</b> Keep in mind that although some employers have blanket policies against recordings, enforcing such policies could be troublesome because discipline for violating a blanket policy can be used as evidence of punishing a protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, for example, an employee claims the recording contained evidence of whistleblower retaliation, managers should be careful before removing the employee for violating the agency ban on such recordings. On appeal, the judge could find the removal is evidence of whistleblower retaliation and therefore protected. If the manager disciplines the employee for the policy violation, the agency has admitted to removing the employee for the tape recording and the action will likely be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">So instead of blanket policies, any ban on recordings should outline the exceptions to the general ban that are not subject to discipline even if the policy is violated. Even if the policy is not specific about these exceptions, managers should know that exceptions still exist.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Terminating an agreement</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Termination of a telework agreement. You can terminate a telework agreement in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee has been officially disciplined for being absent without permission for more than five days in any calendar year.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee has been officially disciplined for violations of subpart G of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch for viewing, downloading, or exchanging pornography, including child pornography, on a federal government computer or while performing official federal government duties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Telework continues to diminish employee or agency performance, even after attempts to mitigate such diminishment have been attempted</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If an employee does not comply with the terms of the written agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">When a telework agreement is being terminated due to diminished performance, the agency needs to be able to document and demonstrate both of the following:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee's teleworking directly and negatively impacts the employee's performance or the performance of the work group/organization.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Remediation can best be accomplished by terminating the telework arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">When terminating an employee's telework agreement, remember that:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Terminations should be based on the provisions of the Telework Enhancement Act and, where discretion is possible, sound reasoning.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You should be fair, consistent, and equitable, making sure that decisions are transparent and supported by the act and agency policies and rules.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Terminations should be in writing and timely.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> In conjunction with HR labor relations specialists and agency counsel, any applicable collective bargaining agreement should be consulted to verify that the agency has complied with any requirements the agreement may place on the agency regarding the termination of a telework agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">As a general rule, a manager should provide official notice to the employee before termination of a telework agreement. The notice should follow some basic principles:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be in writing.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Provide an explanation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be timely.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Include an effective date.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Follow agency policies and procedures for denial/termination of telework requests.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Include any appeals/grievance procedures available to the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Consult with agency employee and labor relations specialists regarding legal requirements and CBA provisions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Additionally, the denial or termination of the telework agreement could include information about when the employee might be eligible for telework again, and if applicable, what actions the employee should take to improve their chance of approval.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Special considerations for termination of remote work arrangement.</b> Terminating a remote work arrangement poses special problems not present when a telework arrangement is terminated, because the employee may not live within commuting distance of an agency worksite.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency should consider how such a situation should be managed when creating a remote agreement with an employee. The answer may turn on whether the position was posted as one in which the employee could work remotely or whether the employee in the position had worked at the agency worksite and then requested a remote arrangement for personal reasons.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">It is part of your job to make telework a success in your agency. These hints will help you get with the program.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Resist telework on principle.</b> It's here, it's the law, and unless you can show with specific business-based reasons why it cannot be applied to your unit, you are better off getting with the program.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Be overly restrictive.</b> If other employees in your agency are teleworking and many of your employees are not, for reasons they don't accept, they will resent it and your bottom line will suffer. You may also find yourself the target of grievances and EEO complaints.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Accept telework as an employee entitlement.</b> Telework is not like annual or sick leave. Your agency's program has specific guidelines for eligibility.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Expect more (or less) from teleworkers than from other employees.</b> All performance and conduct standards should be enforced across the board.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Micromanage teleworkers.</b> If you can't trust your employees, they shouldn't be teleworking, or there is something very wrong with your supervisory style, or both. Telework allows workers more flexibility. Don't try to take it away by constantly hounding them.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Leave teleworkers on their own.</b> Although you don't want to micromanage, you must communicate regularly. Make sure teleworkers have all the information they need to feel part of the team. And make sure they report to you regularly.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Give preferential treatment to non-teleworkers.</b> It is natural to feel closer to the people you see every working day than to those you connect with mostly by telephone or email, but you can't let that color your personnel decisions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Overload non-teleworkers.</b> You may be tempted to assign urgent or last-minute tasks to the people you see at their desks. This is understandable, but if it results in an unfair burden, you may have to adjust your assignment style.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. My employees say they are entitled to telework. Are they?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, not exactly. Telework is not an entitlement of federal employment, like sick leave or annual leave. You need to check on how your agency telework policy and any labor agreements on the subject define eligibility. Then enforce these guidelines. Don't make up your own.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How can I make sure teleworkers are doing what they are supposed to be doing?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The same way you should be evaluating the employees you see every day -- by their results. A certain amount of trust is necessary to make telework successful, but the trust must be validated by performance. Enforce the same standards of performance and conduct on teleworkers that you would on employees in the office. After all, you don't expect most office employees to be at their desks every second of the working day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What do I do if teleworkers fail to keep up their productivity?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You need to find out why. Is this a support problem or a performance problem? If it is a performance problem, treat it as you would any such problem, with informal discussion and, if required, formal counseling. If a performance problem is serious and is not cleared up, it should be documented and telework privileges may be withdrawn (consult HR). But the problem may be insufficient technical support, supervisory support, or support from coworkers. In that case, the level of support to the teleworker needs to be improved. If it cannot be improved, the position may not be suited for telework.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How do I tell employees they are not eligible for telework?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Just as you would transmit any other bad news about their employment -- clearly, professionally, and with full explanation of the reasons. Telework is not an entitlement. Employees who are not eligible under agency guidelines, whether it is "their fault" or not, cannot be permitted to participate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What if non-teleworking employees complain they are being overloaded?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If the complaint is justified, you have a problem either with program design or with your supervision. Employees who telework should produce at least as much as they did before they teleworked. If some work can only be done in the office, and if the employees remaining in the office are handling too much of it, you may have to:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reduce the number of teleworkers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reduce the number of days they telework.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Establish a better rotation of teleworkers to keep the office properly staffed at all times, just as you would with flexible or compressed work schedules.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. A teleworker has the TV on in the background when I call. Is this a problem?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If customers call, it may be. Otherwise, it probably isn't. If you let employees in the office listen to music on headphones, your teleworker can have the TV or music on at home. But you probably should suggest that the use of the mute button when calls come in would be more professional.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What if employees want to telework because they have small children or elderly parents at home?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> This is a problem. Work at home does not coexist well with elder or child care. Make it clear to employees who want to work at home that they must make dependent-care arrangements. The employee assistance program may help. But don't overdo your concern. If an employee wants to use a valid work break to walk the dog, or a lunch break to prepare a meal for family members, that's just one of the advantages of telework. The thing to stress is that those who want to work at home must set up an environment free from nonwork interference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Suppose contacts complain they can't reach teleworkers?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If this happens more often than with employees at the office, you may have a performance problem. Isolated instances probably have reasonable explanations -- ask for them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. My receptionist wants to telework. What do I say?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You may have to say "no," as with other jobs that require office presence. However, avoid a knee-jerk "no." Consider whether some aspects of the job could be done at home, perhaps for one day a week. Could other employees reasonably be asked to cover on that day, just as they would cover when your receptionist is away on leave? Or is it possible to offer a flexible or compressed work schedule that might meet your receptionist's needs? You need to be sensitive to those who, for whatever reason, cannot participate as fully as others in telework, or cannot participate at all.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do I have to grant requests by union officials to telework?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Union officials generally are eligible to participate in telework programs on the same basis as other employees or in accordance with labor agreements on the subject. Telework programs are designed to cover only work assigned by the agency, but agreements may include union representational tasks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Is telework a requirement?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Your agency generally must have a telework program under the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010, with broad eligibility, although some positions are excluded, especially those that require the employee to deal every day with classified materials.</p>
