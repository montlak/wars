<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-5"><span class="space">2.</span> Supervisors</h4>
<p class="noindent">In what seems to be a rather elementary proposition, the EEOC made it clear that tangible employment actions can only be taken by supervisors. Although the proposition is elementary, when applied to the wide array of employment circumstances that arise in cases, it is not always entirely clear whether someone was acting as a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability</span> stated that an individual is an employee's supervisor if:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;the individual has authority to undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee; <span class="Italic">or</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;the individual has authority to direct the employee's daily work activities.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Guidance</span> provides some further definition regarding what it means to have the authority to undertake "tangible employment decisions":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Tangible employment decisions" are decisions that significantly change another employee's employment status.... Such actions include, but are not limited to, hiring, firing, promoting, demoting, and reassigning the employee. As the Supreme Court stated, "[t]angible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual whose job responsibilities include the authority to recommend tangible job decisions affecting an employee qualifies as his or her supervisor even if the individual does not have the final say. As the Supreme Court recognized in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, a tangible employment decision "may be subject to review by higher level supervisors." As long as the individual's recommendation is given substantial weight by the final decisionmaker(s), that individual meets the definition of supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Guidance</span> also defines what it means to have the authority over an employee's work activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual who is authorized to direct another employee's day-to-day work activities qualifies as his or her supervisor even if that individual does not have the authority to undertake or recommend tangible job decisions. Such an individual's ability to commit harassment is enhanced by his or her authority to increase the employee's workload or assign undesirable tasks, and hence it is appropriate to consider such a person a "supervisor" when determining whether the employer is vicariously liable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, one of the harassers was authorized to hire, supervise, counsel, and discipline lifeguards, while the other harasser was responsible for making the lifeguards' daily work assignments and supervising their work and fitness training. There was no question that the Court viewed them <span class="Italic">both</span> as "supervisors," even though one of them apparently lacked authority regarding tangible job decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual who is temporarily authorized to direct another employee's daily work activities qualifies as his or her "supervisor" during that time period. Accordingly, the employer would be subject to vicarious liability if that individual commits unlawful harassment of a subordinate while serving as his or her supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, someone who merely relays other officials' instructions regarding work assignments and reports back to those officials does not have true supervisory authority. Furthermore, someone who directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments would not qualify as a "supervisor." For example, an individual whose delegated authority is confined to coordinating a work project of limited scope is not a "supervisor."</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013), the Supreme Court held that the term "supervisor," for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII, is limited to those individuals who are empowered to take tangible employment actions against the victim. Vance was the only African-American working in her department at Ball State. She filed complaints alleging the use of racial epithets, references to the Ku Klux Klan and "veiled threats of physical harm." Vance argued that three of the workers who racially harassed her were supervisors because they had the authority to direct Vance's work and that Ball State should be strictly liable for the harassment subject to the affirmative defense set for in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742 (1998) and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775 (1998). In its decision below, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court finding that a "'supervisor is someone with power to directly affect the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.'" <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 646 F.3d 461 (7th Cir. 2011), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Ill. Dep't. of Transp</span>., 359 F.3d 498, 506 (7th Cir. 2004). "Directly affecting," according to the Seventh Circuit, meant the authority to hire, fire, demote, promote and discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the Supreme Court, Vance urged adoption of the Commission's more liberal definition of "supervisor" as set forth in its Enforcement Guidance, but the Court declined, opining that the Commission's guidance is a "study in ambiguity." The Commission's guidance, according to the Court, "takes the position that an employee, in order to be classified as a supervisor, must wield authority 'of sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment.'" Rejecting the EEOC's broader definition of the term, the Court noted that neither the <span class="Italic">Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed.2d 633 (1998) or <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed.2d 662 (1998), decision suggested that there should be two categories of supervisors, those who have authority to make tangible employment decisions and "those who, although lacking this power, nevertheless have the ability to direct a co-worker's labor to some ill-defined degree." While slamming EEO Guidance, the Court, in <span class="Italic">Vance</span>, also expounded on the phrase "tangible employment actions":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that an employer may be vicariously liable for an employee's unlawful harassment only when the employer has empowered that employee to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a "significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 761. We reject the nebulous definition of a "supervisor" advocated in the EEOC Guidance[4] and substantially adopted by several courts of appeals. Petitioner's reliance on colloquial uses of the term "supervisor" is misplaced, and her contention that our cases require the EEOC's abstract definition is simply wrong.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The United States urges us to defer to the EEOC Guidance.... But to do so would be proper only if the EEOC Guidance has the power to persuade, which "depend[s] upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, [and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements." ...we do not find the EEOC Guidance persuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the word "supervisor" has "varying meanings both in colloquial usage and in the law,'" the majority noted that a broader interpretation of the term would "frustrate judges and confound jurors."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The interpretation of the concept of supervisor that we adopt today is one that can be readily applied. In a great many cases, it will be known even before litigation is commenced whether an alleged harasser was a supervisor, and in others, the alleged harasser's status will become clear to both sides after discovery. And once this is known, the parties will be in a position to assess the strength of a case and to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute. Where this does not occur, supervisor status will generally be capable of resolution at summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]his approach will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess the authority to inflict psychological injury by assigning unpleasant tasks or by altering the work environment in objectionable ways. In such cases, the victims will be able to prevail simply by showing that the employer was negligent in permitting this harassment to occur....</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Vance</span> decision was deeply divided with Justice Alito joined by Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas, delivering the opinion of the Court, and Justice Ginsburg, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, dissenting. Justice Thomas also filed a concurring opinion. Ginsburg, <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, supported EEOC Guidance on the matter, namely that those with the "authority to direct an employee's daily activities" hold supervisory status under Title VII. For more discussion, see "<a href="0100-2023-21-103.html#sec12-73">Definition of Supervisor</a>" in this chapter. Since the <span class="Italic">Vance</span> decision, the Commission has attached a "Notice Concerning the Supreme Court's Decision in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013)" to the front page of its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, which states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for employer liability for hostile work environment harassment depends typically on whether or not the harasser is the victim's supervisor. An employer is vicariously liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor. In <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013), the Supreme Court rejected in part the EEOC's definition of "supervisor." The Court held that an employee is a "supervisor" if the employer has empowered that employee "to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.'" The Court stated that an employer is liable for hostile work environment harassment by employees who are not supervisors if <span id="Page_803"></span>the employer was "negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place." In assessing such negligence, the Court explained, "the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor to be considered in determining whether the employer was negligent." Also relevant is "[e]vidence that an employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from being filed."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission applied its analysis of the <span class="Italic">Vance</span> decision as stated in its notice in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720140021 (2015). In that case, the complainant alleged harassment based on his disability and for prior EEO activity by coworkers and supervisors. Before the Commission, the agency appealed the administrative judge's finding that Field Training Officers were complainant's "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" supervisors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to Complainant's harassment claim the AJ, following the hearing and based on the evidence before her, determined that Complainant established that the approximately 25 harassing events occurred as he alleged. The AJ also determined that the conduct was unwelcomed and occurred due to his disability. The FTOs and management made comments about his disability in front of Complainant and the class of interns. They disparaged his work ethic and persistently encouraged Complainant to quit. Management took Complainant's need for accommodation and made it the topic of jokes and mean-spirited comments. These persistent events caused by the FTOs and Management over six months were sufficient to create a hostile work environment for Complainant. The AJ concluded that the Agency was liable for the harassment as these actions were taken by supervisors[2] and managers.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The AJ determined that the FTOs were Complainant's <span class="Italic">de facto</span> supervisors who had significant role in critiquing his work and in the decision to terminate his employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without directly addressing the question of whether the FTOs could be properly considered supervisors, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to part (5), we note that on appeal, the Agency argued that the AJ used the wrong standard for employer liability. The Agency argued that the actions were taken by the FTOs who were not the Complainant's supervisors. The standard for employer liability for hostile work environment harassment depends typically on whether or not the harasser is the victim's supervisor. An employer is vicariously liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor. In <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State Univ</span>., 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013), the Supreme Court held that an employee is a "supervisor" if the employer has empowered that employee "to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a "significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." The Court stated that an employer is liable for hostile work environment harassment by employees who are not supervisors if the employer was "negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place." In assessing such negligence, the Court explained, "the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor to be considered in determining whether the employer was negligent." Also relevant is "[e]vidence that an employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from being filed." <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, "Notice Concerning the Supreme Court's Decision in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>" (June 18, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's appeal focused on the events created by the FTOs. However, we find that this would be an incomplete view of Complainant's claim of harassment beginning in February 2009. We note that the SL Supervisor also engaged in ridiculing, humiliating Complainant. Furthermore, it was the SL Supervisor who recommended Complainant for termination and Management that sent the FTOs to Complainant's house to intimidate him. Therefore, we are not persuaded by the Agency's assertion that <span class="Italic">Vance</span> applies in this situation. As such, Complainant has met part (5) of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of harassment for the acts were committed in part by the SL Supervisor. An employer is subject to vicarious liability for unlawful harassment if the harassment was "created by a supervisor with immediate...authority over the [Complainant]." <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999) ("Vicarious Liability Guidance"), at 4 (citing <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 2270 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2292-93 (1998)). Accordingly, the Commission concludes that Complainant has met his burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of harassment based on disability and his prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, for sake of argument, we shall assume that the FTOs are not considered supervisors under <span class="Italic">Vance</span>. Under this scenario, the Agency can make out an affirmative defense by demonstrating: (a) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior; and (b) that complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Industries, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Faragher, supra</span>; Vicarious Liability Guidance, at 12. Whether an employer can prove the first prong of that defense, i.e., that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, depends on the circumstances of the particular situation. Vicarious Liability Guidance, at 15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At a minimum, however, the employer must have a policy and complaint procedure against the harassment that contains the following elements: (1) a clear explanation of what constitutes prohibited conduct; (2) assurances that employees who bring complaints of harassment or provide information related to such complaints will be protected against retaliation; (3) a clearly described complaint process that provides possible avenues of complaint; (4) assurance that the employer will protect the confidentiality of harassment complaints to the extent possible; (5) a complaint process that provides a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation; and (6) assurance that the employer will take immediate and appropriate corrective action when it determines that harassment has occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the findings by the AJ and a review of the record, we determine that the Agency failed to make out its affirmative defense. The record clearly indicated that Complainant made upper management aware of the hostile work environment several times starting in February 2009. The Agency failed to take any corrective action and the harassment continued even after his termination on July 29, 2009. Accordingly, because the Agency has not satisfied the affirmative defense, the Commission finds that the AJ properly concluded that the Agency is liable for the harassment of Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other Commission cases citing to the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Vance</span> case, but not directly applying the <span class="Italic">Vance</span> analysis include: <span class="Italic">Werner K. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120141352 (2016) (whether the alleged offending official qualified as a supervisor was not at issue; "an employer is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee who can take tangible employment actions against the employee such as hiring, firing, or reassigning. <span class="Italic">See Vance v. Ball State Univ</span>., 133 S. Ct. 2434, 2443 (2013)"); <span class="Italic">Fredda J. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120161787 (2016) (involving whether vicarious liability attached for coworker harassment; "An employer is liable for hostile work environment harassment by employees who are not supervisors if the employer was "'negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place.'" <span class="Italic">See Vance v. Ball State Univ</span>., 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013)."); <span class="Italic">Cathy M. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120140008 (2016) (whether the alleged harasser was a supervisor was not at issue; "an employer is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee."); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123044 (2015) ("an agency may be liable for unlawful harassment by an employee when the agency has empowered that employee to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., the harassing employee is a supervisor of the victim. <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 570 U.S., 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013).").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Vance</span> overruled cases such as <span class="Italic">San Diego v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060014 (2007), where the Commission held that employees, such as team leaders who direct daily work assignments or who have "supervisory authority" over the complainant, are properly considered supervisors. Cases such as <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980284 (1999), holding that an agency is not only liable for sexual harassment by titled supervisors, but also for sexual harassment by acting supervisors, is still good law under <span class="Italic">Vance</span>.</p>
