<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-92"><span class="space">3.</span> Credibility Issues</h4>
<p class="noindent">As much as agencies may wish to the contrary, the Commission remains steadfast in its position that unresolved credibility issues cannot be dispensed with through summary judgment. And, as <span class="Italic">Jorgensen v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120092540 (2011), demonstrates, a credibility issue can be as simple as the complainant saying one thing and the supervisor saying another:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence of the non-moving party must be believed and all justified inferences must be drawn in the non-moving party's favor. Upon review of the record, we find that Complainant is alleging that he was subjected to a hostile work environment by S1. Therefore, all the incidents comprising Complainant's hostile work environment shall be viewed collectively. This case contains conflicting evidence as to what S1's real motivation was with respect to the alleged incidents comprising Complainant's hostile work environment claim. S1 asserts that he took various actions against Complainant due to performance issues and/or Complainant's failure to adhere to various policies. However, we find that there are incidents that require further development in order to ascertain S1's motivation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that S1 made reference to his age and medical condition and told him that he should retire. For example, Complainant, in his declaration under penalty of perjury, asserts the following with respect to incident (10), "[o]n February 2, 2006, when [S1] was yelling at me and threatening me, he told me I should retire because I was old enough and because I had a heart attack and had heart problems. He threatened if I did not retire, he would be as hard on me as he could and that I should think of my family and my health and retire/resign immediately." S1, in a "note to the file" dated February 2, 2006, describes incident differently than Complainant. Specifically, S1 states, "I told [Complainant] this he needed to confront the lawyer he had become and decide whether he wanted to continue the same unacceptable pattern of conduct that I would not tolerate...I further stated it was in his interest to confront whether he really wanted to work any longer rather than to proceed and destroy his professional reputation." We find that the AJ erred in construing this incident in favor of the Agency. We find that this matter warrants further development and credibility determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reflects that S1 made reference to Complainant's health in Complainant's 2006 performance appraisal. Specifically, S1 stated, in a narrative to Complainant's performance appraisal, "[t]he current rating period was not as productive as one would have expected from an attorney with [Complainant's] experience and intellect. Part of this problem can be attributed to very real health issues and a decreased work volume...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Complainant asserts that other co-workers were not subjected to the same level of scrutiny by S1. For example, Complainant, in his declaration under penalty of perjury, asserts that there was another attorney in his group and his/her office was more cluttered than his. Complainant asserts that S1 did not provide this attorney with similar directives to clean up his/her office. Thus, we find that a hearing would further develop the record in order to provide information as to whether similarly situated employees outside of Complainant s protected classes were treated differently. Based on the foregoing, the Commission determines that summary judgment in this case was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Inconsistent testimony from the alleged responsible management official will also preclude summary judgment. <span class="Italic">Abe K. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020004252 (2021), is a good example:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding no discrimination, the AJ relied solely on the affidavit of the deciding official that she had legitimate reasons for not selecting Complainant. Yet, credibility is at issue in this case where the deciding official averred she was unaware of Complainant's race, national origin or age, although she interviewed him. Complainant claimed that she told him she wanted to give someone else a chance as the reason for her requesting that the position be reposted, and this was before she interviewed Complainant. She claimed no organizational relationship with Complainant, but one of the stated reasons for not selecting him was premised on her perception of his work. She reasoned "Complainant's past performance, knowledge and ability did not meet the standards and level of performance required for the position he sought to fill." Additionally, there are allegations of past racist statements made by RMO.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains statements that the RMO favored non-Asian candidates and provided the interview questions in advance, which Complainant averred he witnessed. The credibility issue is also raised by the fact that the individual selected was a Level 22, who was selected for a Level 24 position, although he had no prior Postmaster experience. Both the selectee and Complainant had grammatical errors on their application, and yet, this was stated as a determining factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the record is inadequate. It contains inadequate evidence regarding the hostile work environment claim and the Agency's <span id="Page_477"></span>articulated reasons for selecting the lower level candidate. The record contains no evidence regarding the claim that the selecting official made racist statements. There is no evidence that the Agency addressed the perception that it is biased against Asians or favored African-Americans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also missing from the record is information regarding the Agency's record of selections and promotional opportunities made over the past two years or the reasons the position at issue was posted three times after Complainant applied. Moreover, the record does not explain why this decision rested with a single individual. According to the Agency's promotion policy, "Assignment, Reassignment and Promotion Section 743.6, Selection Approval," all selections are subject to the next level review and approval before the action is affected. ROI, p. 396.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the Agency reposted the position at issue three times before selecting an employee, who was a Level 22 employee, for a Level 24 position, while bypassing the Level 23 Asian candidate with nine years of experience, who was the selectee's supervisor. The limited evidence that is in the record lends support to Complainant's claim that the stated reasons were a pretext for unlawful discrimination against him, that his race was a factor in his being bypassed and that Asian Indians are being unfairly excluded from promotional opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the hearing process is intended to be an extension of the investigative process, designed to ensure that the parties have "a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and, in appropriate instances, to examine and cross-examine witnesses." <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 7-1 (Aug. 5, 2015); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e). "Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives Complainant of a full and fair investigation of her claims." <span class="Italic">Bang v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01961575 (Mar. 26, 1998). <span class="Italic">See also Peavley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950628 (Oct. 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Chronister v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05940578 (April 25, 1995). In summary, there are simply too many unresolved issues which require resolution through a hearing, including an assessment as to the credibility of the various witnesses. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the Agency should not have been granted.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jovan S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120180483 (2020) (reversing summary judgment where complainant submitted coworker statements contradicting complainant's supervisor's contention that complainant was difficult to work with; "there are too much unresolved issues which require resolution through a hearing, including an assessment as to the credibility of the various witnesses"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Joel M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140304 (2016) (minor inconsistencies in testimony may not be sufficient to establish a dispute of material fact; finding no material fact in dispute where supervisor denied stating that she did not want complainant at a particular work site, but another witness contradicted the supervisor's contention; "even if PC made that statement, W1 did not state that PC said that she did not want Complainant at WLA because of his race or national origin; therefore, we do not find this to be a material fact. While Complainant stated that he had documentation showing that PC lied under oath and falsified federal documents, which prove that she discriminated against him, he did not provide any documents.").</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not to say that credibility issues can never be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. As a result of <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.</span>, 477 U.S. 242 (1986), courts began to re-examine their view. In the wake of <span class="Italic">Liberty Lobby</span>, a split of authority developed on whether summary judgment can be granted where the factual dispute relates solely to the issues of credibility or pretext, or is a matter of speculation on the issue of discriminatory intent. In <span class="Italic">Liberty Lobby</span>, a defamation case, the Supreme Court found that district courts can weigh the quality and persuasiveness of evidence in ruling on motions for summary judgment. Since that time, the circuit courts of appeal have split on whether the rule developed in <span class="Italic">Liberty Lobby</span> should be applied to discrimination cases. In <span class="Italic">Roberson v. General Services Administration</span>, 01890780 (1989), the Commission outlined the opposing views of the circuit courts:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of [the] Supreme Court cases involved employment discrimination cases. However, <span class="Italic">Liberty Lobby</span> was a defamation case which has intent as an element of the cause of action as do employment discrimination cases. We note that there is a split in authority among the cases in the circuits since the 1986 Supreme Court Cases as to the propriety of summary judgment in employment discrimination cases. Some circuits have retained the pre-1986 narrow view that summary judgment is inappropriate in employment discrimination cases where credibility is at issue, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chipollini v. Spencer Gifts</span>, 814 F.2d 893 (3rd Cir. 1987), or that it was appropriate under only extremely limited circumstances, such as where the facts are undisputed or where only one inference could be drawn from the evidence presented. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paolillo v. Dresser Indus., Inc.</span>, 821 F.2d 81 (2nd Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. University of Pittsburgh</span>, 826 F.2d 230 (3rd Cir. 1987); and <span class="Italic">Perez v. Curcio</span>, 841 F.2d 255 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, other cases have followed the expanded role for summary judgment indicated by the 1986 Supreme Court decisions. They have required more than a fact issue over pretextuality or personal speculation of discriminatory intent to avoid summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Temple University</span>, 829 F.2d 437 (3rd Cir. 1987) (summary judgment granted employer in sex/race discrimination case where physician was terminated from fellowship program for deficient performance despite appellant denying unacceptable performance, claiming inadequate supervision and alleging several examples of a general pattern of discriminatory intent; the court finding, after review of all the evidence, that the only possible fact issue raised was error by her supervisors in evaluating her performance, that evidence that an employer's decision is erroneous is insufficient to create an inference of discriminatory intent, and that no reasonable jury could find the physician was terminated other than as a result of academic decisions made by her supervisors); <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. Allstate Insurance Co.</span>, 803 F.2d 857 (5th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. B. Green &#x0026; Co.</span>, 836 F.2d 845 (4th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Menard v. First Security Services Corp.</span>, 848 F.2d 281 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Roberson</span> case, which the Commission specifically limited to the facts of that case, the decision of an administrative judge to grant summary judgment to the agency was upheld, even though the complainant made several allegations about the adequacy of his performance and the bias of his supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Bang v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961575 (1998), the Commission found that summary judgment was inappropriate where there was an unresolved credibility issue. The complainant was removed based on a witness's account of an altercation at work. The complainant alleged that the witness lacked credibility because she participated in the altercation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bang</span>, noting the complainant's language barrier, found that summary judgment was improper:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts have been clear that summary judgment is not to be used as a "trial by affidavit." <span class="Italic">Redmand v. Warrener</span>, 516 F.2d 766, 768 (1st Cir. 1975). The Commission has noted that when a party submits an affidavit and credibility is at issue, "there is a need for strident cross-examination and summary judgement on such evidence is improper." <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940339 (February 24, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the AJ erred when she concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact in this case. In finding no discrimination, the AJ relied solely an the representations of agency witnesses without considering gaps in the factual record and appellant's contrary representations. The AJ's decision accepted the supervisor's explanation that she fired appellant because her investigation revealed appellant was a combatant in the altercation. However, the supervisor provided no explanation for why she chose to ignore the statements of three eye witnesses who stated appellant was not an aggressor in this incident and played the same role they did (for which they received no discipline) in attempting to separate appellant's husband and Employee A. Appellant has also raised the possibility that the supervisor's investigation was adversely affected by the fact that appellant and the witnesses supportive of her had a limited ability to communicate in English but were provided no opportunity to express themselves in their first language. Appellant asserts the inevitable communication problems skewed the results of the investigation. The record also provides no examination of the numerous comparative employees, including Employee A, who were named by appellant as receiving more favorable treatment from the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we make no judgment about the veracity of the statements made by the various witnesses to this matter, this is precisely the type of evidence that is appropriate for cross-examination, elaboration and credibility determinations. The factual aspects of this case are simply too conflicting to permit a recommended decision without a hearing. EEOC regulations plainly indicate that the hearing is intended as a continuation of the investigatory process. Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives appellant of a full and fair investigation of her claims. Therefore, we find that the AJ erred when she issued a recommended decision without a hearing, and the final agency decision which adopted the AJ's decision must be reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A04099 (2003), the Commission held it was error for the administrative judge to grant summary judgment in favor of the agency where the deciding official had destroyed documents related to the complainant's termination after learning of the EEO complaint. The Commission found that the complainant was entitled to cross-examine the official on his motivation for destroying the documents.</p>
<p class="noindent">A credibility issue is raised when the selecting official maintains that he selected the best qualified candidate for a position and the complainant challenges the selection. In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01890469 (1989), the Commission held that the conclusory affidavit of the selecting official does not dispense with the factual dispute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Summary judgement [sic] is not to be used as a "trial by affidavit." <span class="Italic">Redman v. Warrener</span>, 516 F.2d 766, 768 (1st Cir. 1975). A trial by affidavit occurs when a party submits affidavits consisting of mere opinion where credibility <span id="Page_478"></span>is at issue. It is this type of situation where there is a need for strident cross-examination, and summary judgement [sic] on such evidence is improper. <span class="Italic">R-T Leasing Corp. v. Ethyl Corp.</span>, 494 F. Supp. 1128 (S.D.N.Y. 1980); <span class="Italic">F.A.R. Liquidating Corp. v. Brownell</span>, 209 F.2d 375 (3rd Cir. 1954).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ relied on the SO's testimony that the selectee was, in his opinion, best qualified for the position. It is precisely this type of testimony that is appropriate for cross-examination and a determination on credibility....</p>
<p class="noindent">In the same case, the Commission also decided it was error for the administrative judge to grant summary judgment on a reprisal claim on the basis that the selectee also engaged in prior EEO activity. The Commission noted that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal is not foreclosed by a failure to show disparate treatment. Rather, the focus is on whether the time and manner of the adverse action coincide with protected activity in a way that a retaliatory motive can be inferred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Nicki B. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120141309 (2016) (conclusory statements do not establish a genuine issue of material fact). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A15415 (2002) (complainant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact where he failed to offer evidence tending to rebut the agency's explanation for selection, which may indicate the more recent trend).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reversed an administrative judge's grant of summary judgment where he relied on the unsworn affidavit of complainant's supervisor and left several issues of credibility unresolved in <span class="Italic">Horacio M. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120170934 (2019):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the AJ erred when she concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact in this case. In finding no discrimination, the AJ relied on the unsworn affidavit of S1, who was the alleged harasser. Further, the AJ inappropriately credited S1's affidavit rather than Complainant's, whose assertions as the non-moving party should have been assumed to be true.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the AJ found no evidence of harassment based on Complainant's sex, we disagree. In addition to Complainant's affidavit, the record contains other corroborating affidavits from Complainant's co-workers, which were not referenced by the AJ, supporting Complainant's claim that he was harassed because he did not fit his supervisor's image of a "masculine" male. For example, one witness (W1) stated that S1 made comments about Complainant's height. We note that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of "gender" and includes discrimination because an individual fails to conform to gender-based expectations, stereotypical or otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Macy v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821 (April 20, 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find sufficient evidence in the record which raises a genuine dispute of material fact regarding Complainant's retaliation claim. A witness (W2) averred that Complainant's complaints "fueled the fire," and that he was treated as S1's "whippin' boy." W2 added that S1 was "picking on [Complainant] all the time," and that S1 was "doing as much as he possibly could" prior to his October retirement. Another witness (W3) stated that Complainant was called a "rat," and that S1 was "always belittling him." These affidavits also provide support for Complainant's claim that others were threatened with losing their law enforcement credentials for retirement if they were "cased up." This evidence was seemingly disregarded by the AJ, but we find it raises a genuine dispute as to whether Complainant was subjected to severe or pervasive conduct that created a hostile work environment after he complained about the supervisor's conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the hearing process is intended to be an extension of the investigative process, designed to ensure that the parties have "a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and, in appropriate instances, to examine and cross-examine witnesses." <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 7-1 (Aug. 5, 2015); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e). "Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives Complainant of a full and fair investigation of her claims." <span class="Italic">Bang v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01961575 (March 26, 1998). <span class="Italic">See also Peavley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950628 (October 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Chronister v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05940578 (April 25, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the statements by Complainant and S1, we find that the record contains conflicting evidence with statements from five (5) coworkers who stated that they did not witness any harassing conduct and statements from three (3) coworkers who provided support for Complainant's claims. We find that the parties should be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the available witnesses. In summary, there are simply too many unresolved issues which require an assessment as to the credibility of the various management officials, co-workers, and Complainant, himself. Therefore, judgment as a matter of law for the Agency should not have been granted.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Johanna S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120182005 (2019), the Commission found that the administrative judge failed to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the complainant, and made improper credibility determinations. In reversing the administrative judge's grant of summary judgment, the Commission pointed to unresolved conflicting testimony from witnesses, failure to interview one of the individuals involved in the at issue altercation, and statements taken from individuals who did not witness the alleged events.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency asserts the interviewing panel had no knowledge of the complainant's EEO activity but there is some evidence to the contrary resolution of the case requires credibility determinations that preclude summary judgment. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120121641 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that Complainant was not selected because the panel did not give her the highest score following the interview. However, on appeal, Complainant, through her attorney, asserts that the AJ should have held a hearing because there are critical issues of credibility regarding the panel members' testimony of why it scored the candidates as it did. Specifically, Complainant argues that there is evidence that her prior EEO activity was considered by the panel. While the Agency argued that Complainant did not show that the panel members were aware of her prior EEO activity, Complainant asserts the Agency has misrepresented evidence of record regarding prior knowledge. Complainant points to an email in the record from one of the panel members, as well as her affidavit during the investigation, which indicates that she was aware of Complainant's prior protected activity before the selection interviews. While acknowledging that the passage of time may be a factor in the evaluation of a reprisal claim, Complainant's attorney argues that here "there [were] contemporary references to the prior activity as well as new activity in the form of a class action claim."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Complainant points to the affidavits of the panel members gathered during the investigation to establish that not all the members were in agreement with the scoring results. Based on this potential disagreement between the panel members, she argues that live testimony by the panel members, tested by cross-examination, was needed for the AJ to evaluate whether the reasons for Complainant's non-selection were credible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that these issues were resolved by the AJ by weighing conflicting evidence and making credibility determinations in a manner not appropriate for summary judgment. In summary, we find that there remain genuine issues of material fact which are not appropriate for a summary judgment regarding the instant non-selection claim. Instead, a hearing is necessary to adequately address the issues of witness credibility and to adjudicate those issues of material fact which remain in dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an interesting decision, the Commission essentially found that a party cannot create its own material dispute of fact. In <span class="Italic">Crosby v. Secretary of Army</span>, 07A60038 (2006), both the agency and complainant filed motions for summary judgment in a selection case. The administrative judge granted summary judgment to the complainant on the basis that he had superior qualifications and conflicting statements given by agency witnesses about the selection process. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crosby</span>, upheld judgment for the complainant explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record in its entirety, including consideration of all statements submitted on appeal, we find that the AJ's decision correctly determined that no material facts remained in dispute and a decision without a hearing was appropriate. We note specifically that both parties filed separate motions for summary judgment, and that the agency in particular argued on repeated occasions during the administrative process that the material facts were undisputed. Significantly, we concur with the AJ that complainant showed his qualifications for the subject position to be superior to the selectee's qualifications. Furthermore, we note, as did the AJ, that agency personnel provided shifting responses concerning the selection process. We find the record sufficiently developed and consider that neither party argued, until after the AJ's ruling, that a hearing was necessary to further the investigative process. We note that although the agency challenged the AJ's finding of discrimination, the agency has not argued that if discrimination is upheld the remedies should be altered for any reason.</p>
<p class="noindent">In civil actions, the <span class="Italic">Liberty Lobby</span> rule is somewhat easier to apply because, most often, both parties are represented by counsel and have engaged in substantial discovery. The court, therefore, has no role as a neutral investigator, but rather sits as a neutral adjudicator.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, even in the courts, the trend in discrimination cases, particularly with the advent of jury trials, seems to be away from granting summary judgment where the evidence is such that there are any credibility determinations to be made<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Luria v. Dalton</span>, 164 F.3d 671 (1st Cir. 1999). In <span class="Italic">Luria</span>, the court noted that it must assume the truth of all statements made by the party opposing summary judgment. In ruling that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on a sexual harassment claim, the First Circuit noted, "[t]his is the standard even when the court entertains grave doubts about such a statement; like the weighing of evidence generally, the task of determining the credibility of a witness is the exclusive domain of the finder of <span id="Page_479"></span>fact." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 674. But, in rejecting a claim of retaliation, the court also noted that "some statements are so conclusory as to come within an exception that rule." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 675. The distinction in the two claims was that, in opposition to summary judgement on the harassment claim, the plaintiff submitted an under oath affidavit that alleged several instances of being propositioned and also put the authenticity of some of the government's evidence in dispute. In support of the retaliation claim, the plaintiff could only claim protected activity and the subsequent denial of a temporary position. As a result, her retaliation claim was based solely on conclusory evidence that was not sufficient to withstand summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Collum v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A21611 (2003) (the mere charge that the supervisor was motivated by the complainant's disability is insufficient to raise a dispute of material fact in the absence of any evidence).</p>
<p class="noindent">A genuine credibility dispute on the responsible management official's knowledge of protected activity precludes summary judgment. However, the dispute must be specific and the complainant cannot merely assert the management official knew. For example, in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986162 (2001), the complainant testified that her appointment was the result of an EEO settlement and that she showed the settlement letter to the responsible management official when she first started the position. In light of this specific testimony, the Commission found it was error for the administrative judge to grant summary judgment to the agency based on the management official's testimony that he was not aware of the complainant's previous EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Murray v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A10164 (2001) (summary judgment precluded where deciding official's and complainant's testimony were at variance); <span class="Italic">Wachter v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01986053 (2001) (error to grant summary judgment based on the affidavit of a responsible management official where complainant presented substantial testimony and documents to support his contention that his performance was outstanding); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05447 (2001) (complainant's testimony and that of some witnesses directly contradicted the supervisor's testimony); <span class="Italic">Sivley v. Attorney General</span>, 01982287 (2001) (supervisors' testimony that complainant did not apply for SES positions was controverted by testimony that the positions were filled without an application process); <span class="Italic">Santos v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985592 (2001) (judge erred in relying on the supervisor's affidavit that complainant was granted reasonable accommodation where the complainant testified that he was required to perform duties outside his 10-pound lifting restriction); <span class="Italic">Walczak v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980287 (2001) (summary judgment improper where complainant's and coworkers' testimony was at variance on whether alleged incidents of harassment occurred).</p>
