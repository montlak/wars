<h4 class="h4" id="sec19-59"><span class="space">2.</span> Disparate Treatment Analysis</h4>
<p class="noindent">A good example of the intentional discrimination or disparate treatment analysis in a class action case is provided by <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Attorney General</span>, 0120122033 (2013). In addition to finding that the class had established a case of disparate impact on the basis of sex in the assignment of agents to foreign and supervisory positions, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, also found that the agency had engaged in disparate treatment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a class complaint of disparate treatment, the Class bears the initial burden of making out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters, supra</span> at 336. A claim of disparate treatment is examined under the three-part analysis first enunciated in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). For the Class to prevail, they must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination, i.e., that a prohibited consideration was a factor in the adverse employment actions. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802; <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567 (1978). Because the class action complaint, due to its very nature, alleges a concerted effort on the part of the Agency to discriminate systemically against a certain group of persons, the factual allegations for a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment in class actions are significantly greater than those required in an individual complaint. Specifically, the Supreme Court has noted that to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment, the Class is required to do more than simply adduce evidence of isolated or sporadic acts of discrimination against individual class members. <span class="Italic">Teamsters, supra</span> at 336. Instead, the Class must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency regularly and purposefully treated protected class members less favorably than the majority group members. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 335. Evidence can take the form of statistics alone or a combination of statistics and anecdotal evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 339. Reliable evidence of gross statistical disparities, standing alone, can constitute <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the Class establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment, the burden then shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). Once the Agency has met its burden, the Class bears the ultimate responsibility to persuade the fact finder by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency acted on the basis of a prohibited reason. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the entire record, we find that the Class has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency regularly and purposefully treated female SAs less favorably than male SAs. As stated earlier, we agree with the AJ that the statistical evidence shows that there was a pattern of females being non-selected for foreign positions at the GS 11, 12, and 13 levels. The statistics provided by the Class's expert show that between 1988 and 1994, and most importantly during the class period of 1990-1992, there was a clear trend where male SAs were more successful at obtaining foreign positions than female SAs at the GS-11, 12, and 13 levels.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These statistics are supported by the substantial anecdotal evidence in the record of the 13 class members who testified at the hearing. The record reflects the widespread belief amongst Agency managers and the staff of the Office of International Operations that females would not be as effective as males in countries considered by the Agency to be hostile to women. This conclusion is supported by statements from individuals directly involved in the selection process for foreign positions. For example, CR's manager, who also served as the Chief of the Southeast Asia Section in the Office of International Operations during the class period, and later as the Deputy Chief of International Relations, made very revealing statements during the hearing. When he was asked whether sex was a factor considered in the selections to overseas positions, specifically in countries that may be perceived as male dominated, he stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"I think it could have been considered, yes, to be honest with you. You're asking me an honest question. I'm giving you an honest answer." And "I think if you were going to send a person to a country that beheads people and everything else for being a woman for trying to interact and things of that nature, I think I would take that into consideration and say, 'You know what? I think we probably don't need to send a woman here.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Staff Coordinator in the European Section from 1990 to 1993, who was subsequently promoted as Chief of the Far East Operations Section in the Office of International Operations, gave similarly revealing testimony. When he was asked whether "in [his] opinion, when [he was] in [the Office of International Operations], either in the Far East section or European section, would female agents have been able to operate to the same extent as male agents did in those particular countries....?," the Staff Coordinator responded, "No," and "in my opinion, they would not have been accepted as counterparts by the host country authorities." The Staff Coordinator also testified that placing a female SA in "a two-man office in Songkhla in Southern Thailand, which is the Muslim area of Thailand...that would not be a productive place to put a female agent." The Staff Coordinator also stated that a particular female was not selected for a position in Athens, Greece, because his "basic concern was I thought at that time putting a female agent in a place like Athens was not going to be productive for the employee and it was that simple."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Office of International Operations' Deputy stated at the hearing that he "did have a concern in some of the Muslim countries as to whether female agents would be able to work in the host country counterparts." We agree with the AJ that these statements, made by individuals directly involved with the selection process for foreign assignments, are indicative of bias towards women being assigned to cultures considered by the Agency to be male dominated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Substantial anecdotal evidence in the record reflects that this bias against female SAs in foreign positions is widespread in the Agency. For example, CM1 testified that her supervisors repeatedly told her not to get upset if she was not selected for Asian positions because they were "male dominated cultures" and the Agency did not select female SAs for those positions. Similarly, CM4 testified that she was told that women were considered "second-class citizens" in Asian and Muslim countries and the Agency would probably chose men for those positions. CM6 testified that when she was scheduled to train in Saudi Arabia, the Chief of International Training told her not to go because she would not be well received at the post as a female. Additionally, for a training assignment in Korea, it was requested that a male agent be sent instead of CM6 because she would not be well received as a female. CM10 testified that when she spoke to her supervisors about her desire to go to Thailand, she was told that there were "no women there and probably wouldn't be any women in the near future." CM11 testified that she was discouraged from going to or applying for countries in the Far East since women were not selected for those positions because men did not respect the women in those countries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reflects a widespread practice that female SA applicants were frequently asked questions about childcare and pregnancies that were not similarly asked of male applicants. For example, CM2 testified that one of her supervisors who was in a position to recommend her for foreign assignments told her that women should be home having babies and that women should not be SAs. When CM2 became pregnant, the supervisor called her a "useless Agent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When CM2 was recommended <span id="Page_1649"></span>as the second choice for a position in Mexico, the Office of International Operations' recommendation memorandum focused on CM2's status as a single mother. Subsequently, CM2 was called about a position in Lima, Peru, and a staff member from the Office of International Operations asked her if she "knew what she was doing" in applying for Lima, and asked her "how could [she], a single mother, want to take [her] child to a country like that" and whether it was a suitable place for a "woman like [her]" to take a child. Similarly, CM3 testified that two of her supervisors who had control over recommendations for her foreign assignment applications told her that if she wanted a foreign assignment to Bangkok she should stop getting pregnant. One supervisor stated to CM3 "If you keep getting pregnant, I won't be able to get you to Bangkok." Another supervisor told CM3 that if she wanted to go to Bangkok she should not have any more children, because the Agency did not want to send pregnant females overseas. CM11 was asked by two supervisors about what she would do with her daughter if she went overseas. There is no evidence in the record that male applicants were asked these questions or subjected to similar derogatory comments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reflects a stereotypically biased view within the Agency that husbands would not be willing to follow their SA wives to foreign positions. For example, CR testified that the staff in the Office of International Operations focused more on her husband following her overseas than on her experience and qualifications. The record reveals that CR's husband, a retired police officer, was ready and willing to move overseas if CR was selected for a foreign assignment. Despite knowing this, the staff of the Office of International Operations repeatedly denied her positions based on their disbelief that her husband would follow her overseas, and stated to CR's supervisor "Is her husband really going to retire and follow her overseas?" It is significant to note the male SA who was selected for one of the positions CR applied for was not asked whether his wife was willing to move. CM8 similarly testified that her supervisors made discriminatory comments about her marital status, and her supervisor asked her "how would your husband feel about going wherever?" CM11 similarly testified that a supervisor asked her "what would your husband do [overseas]?" Another supervisor asked her what her husband thought of her going abroad and what she would do with her daughter. The AJ correctly noted that while the above questions are not clear violations of Title VII, they become illicit when they are used to treat females differently than men.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The testimony provided by the class members also support the AJ's finding that although many qualified females applied for overseas positions, males were routinely selected over equally or better qualified female applicants. For example, the AJ found CR was well qualified for a foreign assignment. She performed at the highest levels in the Denver office, was designated as the case agent for high profile cases, received commendations for her work on important cases, had supervisory experience at the GS-14 level, and was rated "Excellent" and "Outstanding" on her performance evaluations. For one position in particular that CR was extremely qualified for, she had performed in the position during a TDY and had the high recommendation of the location's Consul General. The male selectee for the position had five years less tenure than CR, was a grade lower than CR, had not worked in that location previously, and did not have the recommendation of the Consul General. Despite CR's extensive qualifications, male SAs were selected for all but one of the seventeen positions CR applied for during the class period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence in the record reflects that class members Agency wide had experiences similar to CR. For example, CM1 had TDYs in both Tokyo and the Hague, was an expert in Asian trafficking, went to Mexico frequently for work, and went to Australia out of her own pocket to work with law enforcement. Despite her experience, a less qualified male was selected for a permanent assignment in both Tokyo and the Hague. CM5 had specialty experience in Colombian cartels and was extremely fluent in Spanish, and when she told her supervisors about her desire to work overseas, one supervisor stated that even though she was an excellent agent, "the best female agent was not equivalent to the worst male agent." Despite her specialty expertise, CM5 was not selected for a position in Colombia. CM6 was not selected for any foreign positions even though she was extremely qualified, her supervisor "highly recommended" her, and some of her supervisors made calls to the Office of International Operations on her behalf. CM7 was not selected for assignments in Nigeria, even though she was very experienced in Nigerian heroin trafficking cases. CM8 had a Masters Degree, was promoted to a GS-13 position relatively fast because of her exceptional performance, and had supervisory experience. She applied for a position in Lagos that she was extremely qualified for, however a male with less time on the job was selected for the position. CM9 had extensive experience travelling to European countries to work on her cases, and despite this, males were selected for the permanent European posts she applied for.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reflects that staff from the Office of International Operations often made false or unsubstantiated claims for why female SAs were not selected for foreign assignments. For example, CR was told that she was not selected for a position in Bangkok because she did not know the geographical location of Bangkok. CR stated that she was never asked about the geographical location of Bangkok. Additionally, CM3 testified that she was told she did not get a foreign assignment in Bangkok because she did not "know something about the altitude of Bangkok," even though she was never asked about Bangkok's altitude. CM12 was told by a manager in the Office of International Operations that she was not selected for a position in Nigeria because they "figured she didn't know what she was doing."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record supports the AJ's finding that the Agency was aware of the lack of representation of female SAs in foreign assignments. The Career Board, which made the selections for GS-14 and GS-15 assignments, was routinely informed by EEO representatives about the demographics (including race and gender) of the prospective applicants for the vacant foreign post positions, and was therefore aware of which applicants were male and female. Additionally, the minutes from the Career Board meetings contained marking indicating the gender of the applicants (or "minority coding" as referred to by the Class), although it was unclear who made the markings and it was therefore deemed inconclusive by the AJ. The Career Board was aware that female SAs were underrepresented in foreign positions and received quarterly reports on minority and female representation at the meetings. Additionally, on August 5, 1992, the U.S. Government Accountability Office ("GAO") conducted an audit of the Agency's minority promotion statistics and concluded that the Career Board "fell short in the category of female...promotions." The record reveals that the minutes from a Career Board meeting in August 1992 reflected the Board's knowledge of the GAO's audit and conclusions that there was an underrepresentation of female SAs promoted to the GS-14 and GS-15 positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's finding that the Class established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment, as a preponderance of the evidence in the record establishes that the Agency regularly and purposefully treated female SAs less favorably than male SAs in the selection for foreign assignments at GS levels 11-15. The AJ correctly found that the Class showed that disparate treatment of female SAs was not isolated, inadvertent or irregular, and that it was the Agency's standard operating procedure in selecting SAs for foreign positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, there is no evidence in the record that would establish that the Agency provided an articulation as to why it did not select qualified female SAs for foreign positions. Additionally, the Agency did not provide an explanation for why it only interrogated female applicants about matters such as their childcare arrangements and pregnancies, and why it focused more heavily on whether female applicants' husbands could adjust to a role as an overseas spouse. As a result, we find that the Class established that it was subjected to disparate treatment.</p>
