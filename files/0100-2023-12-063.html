<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-63"><span class="space">3.</span> Complaints on Behalf of Others</h4>
<p class="noindent">The person who files the complaint must be the person who is actually aggrieved or his or her representative. A wife who files a complaint that an agency has taken action against her husband and stepson because of her EEO activities is not an aggrieved person within the meaning of the Act. <span class="Italic">Straining</span> <span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 01841625 (1984). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gustafson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912308 (1991), the Commission found an allegation that the complainant's spouse did not receive a transfer because of his age and physical disability did not state a claim. Note that the husband or the stepson in <span class="Italic">Straining</span> properly could have filed a complaint on his own behalf alleging he was disciplined because of a family member's EEO activities. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DeMedina v. Reinhardt</span>, 444 F. Supp. 573 (D.D.C. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent">It does not state a claim for a complainant to allege that his daughter's employment was terminated because of his EEO activity. There is no allegation that the complainant was personally aggrieved; only the daughter can file such a complaint. <span class="Italic">See McNurlan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955386 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01975380 (1998), the Commission held a complaint that a relative is being punished for complainant's EEO activity does not state a claim. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Melton v. Postmaster General,</span> 01972363 (1998) (same). Likewise, it does not state a claim of reprisal when the complainant asserts that a coworker is being treated adversely for engaging in protected activity on behalf of the complainant, or that her EEO representative is being disparaged by management. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Attorney General</span>, 01A00588 (2001). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gowan v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A21664 (2002), the Commission found that the representative's complaints about how his clients cases were being processed and that management made disparaging remarks to his clients about him did not state a claim. The Commission found "such allegations are best addressed within the confines of the complaint raised by the individual whom the complainant is representing, rather than as a complaint filed by complainant in his own name." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Despite what would seem to be a well-established body of law in this area, in <span class="Italic">Tinsley-Meyers v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01983304 (1999), the Commission came to precisely the opposite conclusion. In that case, the complainant, who no longer worked for the agency, alleged that the agency transferred her husband in retaliation for her prior EEO activity. Relying on a new section of its <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, issued in May 1998, the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, EEOC Directives Transmittal 915.003 8-II(3)(c) (May 20, 1998) provides that retaliation against a close relative of an individual who opposed discrimination can be challenged by both the individual who engaged in protected activity and the relative, where both are employees. In this case, although the record discloses that appellant was no longer an employee of the agency at the time of the alleged discrimination, the cornerstone of her complaint, i.e., her allegations of retaliation, arose as a result of her past employment with the agency. As the remaining portion of allegation concerns acts of retaliation taken against appellant's husband due to appellant's prior EEO activity, we find that it states a claim...</p>
<p class="noindent">Proving nothing more than that some people will complain about anything, the Commission upheld dismissal of a complaint that alleged the complainant was the victim of sex discrimination when he was not allowed to bring his son to a "Take our Daughters to Work Day" event. <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A04728 (2001). In his brief on appeal, the complainant argued that management failed to take his complaint seriously. Obviously, neither did the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who alleges that her supervisor will be disciplined if he was not successful in controlling her has failed to state a claim. Such a claim alleges no personal harm to the complainant with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">Chivington v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01A40756.txt">01A40756</a> (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a distinction between a complaint that alleges the employee is aggrieved by an agency action taken against someone else, and a complaint filed by a third party, in a representative capacity, on behalf of someone. The Commission deleted all references to "third party complaints" which were contained in previous versions of its regulations. However, this does not mean that a complaint can be initiated only by the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">LIBERTAD v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05910768 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">LIBERTAD</span>, an organization sought to file what it characterized as a "third party complaint" on behalf of several aggrieved agency employees over various agency practices. Although the complaint clearly indicated that it was being filed on behalf of certain agency employees, those employees were not specifically identified in the complaint. The Commission found that the agency incorrectly dismissed the complaint in <span class="Italic">LIBERTAD</span> as a third party complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission's current Federal sector regulations do not contain the term "third party complaint," both the Commission's Federal sector and private sector regulations provide for the filing of "on-behalf-of" complaints or charges. Specifically, and as is noted in our previous decision, current Federal sector regulations provide that a complaint maybe filed by an organization for an aggrieved person with that person's consent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.212(a). This regulation, by its terms, requires several circumstances to be present. First, the complaint must be filed on behalf of an aggrieved employee or applicant for employment, and not on behalf of the organization. Second, the organization must have the employee's consent to file the complaint. In effect, the organization would be acting as the aggrieved person's representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the letter...described itself as a "third party complaint." Despite the fact that our regulations no longer contain the term "third party complaint," the Commission does not find that this characterization should have proven fatal for the instant complaint. The Commission finds that the intent of the complaint at issue clearly falls within the provisions of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.212(a). However, the complaint did contain other flaws which needed to be addressed to bring the complaint into compliance with the requirements of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.212(a). For example, the complaint did not identify the allegedly aggrieved employees. In addition, it did not provide evidence that the complaint was being filed with the consent of the employees. Finally, the complaint failed to set forth, with specificity, the alleged discriminatory actions at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the organization should have been referred to an EEO counselor for precomplaint counseling to clarify the allegations and to provide the identities of the allegedly aggrieved employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, an allegation that the complainant was not allowed to attend a meeting with the agency Civil Rights Director as President of the Minority Coalition does not state a claim because "[c]omplainant's representation of other employees though an employment resource group is not sufficiently tied to her employment status with the agency..." <span class="Italic">Donnelly v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A05376 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Coworkers may be able to file a complaint on another employee's behalf when the aggrieved employee is mentally incompetent to act on his own behalf. In <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944066 (1994), several coworkers timely contacted an EEO counselor after observing an incident in which a mentally retarded custodian was struck by his supervisor. The counselor told the coworkers they could not initiate a complaint on behalf of another employee. Thereafter, the agency dismissed a complaint by the employee as untimely filed. The Commission reversed and remanded the complaint for further processing because it was not clear whether the coworkers were trying to file their own complaint or were acting as the employee's representatives. The Commission further instructed the agency to make a determination on whether the complainant was competent to handle his own affairs for the purposes of pursuing a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant cannot pursue a "generalized grievance" that members of one protected group are afforded benefits not offered to other protected groups, unless the complainant further alleges some specific injury to her as a result of the alleged discrimination practice. In <span class="Italic">Honore v. Postmaster General</span>, <span id="Page_178"></span>01953482 (1996), the complainant alleged that the agency "obstructed the prospects of employees by failing to inform or post official notice of all job vacancies and, instead, granted preferential treatment by filling positions by 'word of mouth,' nepotism, and other means of communication not available to all employees...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In reversing the agency's dismissal of the case on the basis that the complainant was not aggrieved, the Commission noted the complainant in <span class="Italic">Honore</span> had alleged that she was adversely affected by the alleged practices:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision interpreted the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Warth v. Seldin</span>, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), as holding that a generalized grievance shared by substantially all or a large class of individuals was not sufficient to establish standing. The final agency decision interpreted the appellant's complaint as alleging that the actions in dispute affected all employees in the Baton Rouge 708 and 707 Zip Codes, creating a hostile work environment. The final agency decision concluded that, therefore, the appellant was not aggrieved and had failed to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the appellant's complaint, when read in conjunction with her allegations of disparate treatment described in the EEO Counselor's report, alleges a direct and personal deprivation at the hands of the employer, that is, that the agency had provided other named employees, not in the appellant's protected groups, employment privileges, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, details and reassignments, which it denied the appellant. The appellant's complaint also identifies the mechanisms which facilitated the alleged discrimination, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, "word of mouth," nepotism, and other means of communication not available to all employees in Baton Rouge 708 and 707 zip codes. These allegations are sufficient to show that the appellant is an allegedly aggrieved employee and, therefore, to state a claim under 29 CFR Part 1614. The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Warth v. Seldin</span>, upon which the final agency decision relied, does not require a different result. In the <span class="Italic">Warth</span> case, unlike the instant case, the plaintiffs had not alleged facts showing that they personally had sustained an unresolved harm due to the allegedly discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60260 (2006) (upholding dismissal of complaint to the extent that it was a generalized grievance alleging that the agency terminated Hispanic males).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Criddle v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01966674 (1998), the Commission held that the complainant's allegation that she was the only black female to be promoted to Grade 14 failed to state a claim. The Commission held that the complainant did not claim that she was harmed by the agency's actions. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Tyson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05398 (2001), the Commission dismissed a claim alleging that a vacation policy disadvantaged black employees with more seniority in relation to white employees with less seniority, because the complainant did not allege she was personally harmed by the policy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Except in the context of a class action, a complainant may not file a complaint seeking a remedy on behalf of another employee. However, it is possible that an action taken against one employee can, in fact, aggrieve another employee. For example, in <span class="Italic">Doucette v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05920719 (1993), the Commission found the employee stated a claim when she alleged that the agency created a hostile working environment. As part of that claim, the employee alleged that a friend and coworker was suspended to deter him and other white employees from working with her. The Commission held that the employee was entitled to have the complaint processed to the extent that she alleged the agency's action in suspending the coworker contributed to the hostile working environment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Santee v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05900696 (1990) (a complaint brought by a white male who alleged, in part, that his black fianc&#x00E9; was reprimanded as part of an effort to break up their relationship).</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that the agency discriminated against the complainant by disqualifying her representative from continued representation on a previously-filed EEO complaint due to the workload in the representative's unit fails to state a claim. <span class="Italic">See Al-Mateen v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01960384 (1996). Similarly, a complaint by a representative that he was bypassed when the EEO counselor directly contacted the complainant to discuss resolution does not state a claim. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01993584 (2001). However, when an agency fails to grant a duly-appointed employee representative official time to engage in representational activities, this does aggrieve the complainant. <span class="Italic">See Petrin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986129 (1999).</p>
