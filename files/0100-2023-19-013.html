<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-11d"><span class="space">d.</span> Disciplinary Cases</h5>
<p class="noindent">It should be apparent from the above that what constitutes a similarly situated employee will vary depending on the type of case. For example, what is relevant to determining whether an employee is similarly situated in a disciplinary case is different from what is relevant in a performance-based or a selection case. In the context of a disciplinary case, the Commission has indicated the comparison employees "must have reported to the same supervisor as the [appellant], must have been subject to the same standards governing performance evaluation and discipline, and must have engaged in conduct similar to the [appellant's], without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the appropriate discipline for it." <span class="Italic">Mazzella v. RCA Global Communications, Inc.</span>, 642 F. Supp. 1531, 1546-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01904090 (1991), <span class="Italic">quoting Mazzella</span>. In <span class="Italic">O'Neal</span>, the Commission found it was pretext for the agency to contend that it treated the complainant differently because he did not work in the same facility as the comparison employees, where all of the employees were under the same supervisor. The Commission reversed the employee's removal and ordered him reinstated, subject to a suspension of 15 calendar days, which is what the comparison employees received for similar infractions.</p>
<p class="noindent">"For claims where the alleged discriminatory action is an agency's response to problem conduct, where the proffered comparator's conduct was materially distinguishable from that of complainant, he or she is not similarly situated to Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Ezequiel P. v. Postmaster General,</span> 2021002377 (2022) ("Complainant established that he is a member of a protected class based on his sex, race, and color, and that he suffered an adverse employment action when the Agency prolonged his time off work. However, Complainant's only proffered comparator was C1 (the employee who accused him of rape), who was not 'similarly situated' because, unlike Complainant, she was not accused of rape by another employee."); <span class="Italic">Grappone v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC No. 01A10667 (Sept. 7, 2001), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A20020 (Dec. 28, 2002) (comparator's conduct was materially distinguishable from that of the complainant where the comparator was disciplined for not routinely requesting identification of all customers, while complainant had not requested identification and had actually served alcohol to minors), <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of the Treas</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120132983 (Jun. 10, 2015) (comparator and complainant were subject to different disciplinary actions because they committed different infractions, which rendered two different disciplinary findings)." <span class="Italic">Colene M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000924 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent">When discipline is the issue, the similarity of offenses must be taken into account, as well as the disparity in discipline and the reasons offered for that disparity. <span class="Italic">Hazley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01881550 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Hazley</span>, the <span id="Page_690"></span>complainant was terminated for continuing to accept workers' compensation benefits after returning to work. The complainant showed that two comparison employees, one arrested and convicted of selling cocaine and the other found to have taken money from a coworker, received little or no discipline, whereas she was terminated. The agency argued that the complainant's conduct was "on premises" while the comparison employees' conduct was not. Although the agency cited no particular regulatory violation in any of the cases, in <span class="Italic">Hazley</span>, the Commission found that all three employees violated the same regulation prohibiting criminal and dishonest conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Postmaster attempted to distinguish CE-1's and appellant's situations by focusing on whether one was more work related or "on premise" than the other, we are not persuaded such a difference existed, or assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that it did exist, that such a distinction justified the disparate actions of no discipline and termination for equally unacceptable behavior. Similarly, because CE-2's infraction of accepting money from another employee would appear work related, we are unable to distinguish appellant's and CE-2's situations such that the disparate disciplinary actions of termination and suspension would appear justified.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission noted that it was not suggesting that the agency terminate all such employees in order to avoid Title VII liability, but merely that similar disciplinary actions be taken for similar offenses, regardless of race. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Kindred v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961827 (1998) (an employee charged with selling cocaine and an employee charged with possession of marijuana and carrying a concealed weapon are not similarly situated).</p>
<p class="noindent">When two employees have committed essentially the same offense, a disparity in discipline may, standing alone, demonstrate discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lashley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962053 (1998), the Commission found discrimination where the agency provided unequal punishments to two employees who were similarly at fault in an altercation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of the alleged discrimination, the appellant was employed as a Distribution Window Clerk, PS-05, at the Vista Post Office, Vista, California. The investigative record shows that an incident occurred between the appellant and a White female co-worker on December 16, 1994, because the White co-worker was agitated by the appellant's behavior. The White co-worker asked the Customer Service Supervisor (CSS) to accompany her to the appellant's work area where she started yelling at the appellant angrily. The CSS testified that the White co-worker was "angry and was almost nose-to-nose with [the appellant], approximately 3-4 inches from his face." The CSS pushed a piece of equipment between the two of them in order to separate them, but the White co-worker got around the CSS and got in front of the appellant. Although the White co-worker could not recall waving her hands in the appellant's face or striking him, she acknowledged saying to the appellant: "You are not only an ass hole, you are a lazy lying ass hole." The CSS testified that the appellant said to the White co-worker: "If you got in my face again I'll knock you out." The White co-worker began leaning forward saying that the appellant had threatened her. The CSS testified that the appellant "then put up his arm and gently held her back by pushing on her chest area. I held them back. I told them both to be quiet and then to 'shut up' and stop this. [The White co-worker] backed away and I told her to go to the office and [the appellant] to go back to work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above incident, the CSS issued a 7-day suspension to the White co-worker and a 14-day suspension to the appellant. The CSS subsequently waived the co-worker's suspension because she had displayed remorse for being a part of the incident and because she "did not threaten, but [was] merely reacting to harassment" by the appellant. However, the appellant was required to serve the suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD states that the appellant failed to prove a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination because the comparative employee was not similarly situated, and in any event that the agency articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions because "the complainant was suspended due to the severity of the incident and the other employee involved was also suspended."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the agency's findings. As noted above, although both the appellant and the co-worker were issued notices of suspension for the same incident, the appellant was issued a suspension that was for a period twice as long as that given to the co-worker. Besides, the co-worker's suspension was waived, but not the appellant's. Thus, the appellant clearly established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the agency's finding that the appellant failed to establish that the agency's actions taken in accordance with its policy regarding threats of violence were a pretext for race discrimination. The record shows that the appellant was treated more harshly for the same incident in which the White co-worker clearly played an equally egregious role. She initiated the confrontation with the appellant, got into his face, used foul language, and continued to get close to the appellant in spite of the CSS's efforts to separate the two. Although the co-worker could not recall physically touching the appellant, the CSS acknowledged that the appellant merely "gently held her back" by putting up his arm when she continued to get close to him. The Postal Inspector's report regarding this incident did not recommend any action, nor did it find that either employee's behavior was more egregious than the other's. We also find the CSS's explanation for waiving the co-worker's suspension pretextual where he states that she was "merely reacting to harassment"' by the appellant. As summarized above, it was the co-worker's anger and physically aggressive actions that led the appellant to hold her back and to respond angrily.</p>
<p class="noindent">Employees are not similarly situated where the offenses are different and the employees work for different supervisors. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Allen v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120063201 (2008), where the Commission found that two employees were not similarly situated to the complainant who was placed in emergency off-duty status pending an investigation into allegations that she was gambling while collected OWCP benefits. One of the putative comparative employees had been disciplined for engaging in a workfloor altercation and the other worked for a different supervisor than the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the fact that the employees work for different supervisors does not preclude a finding of discrimination where discipline is actually imposed at a higher level. In <span class="Italic">Ferrell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064642 (2008), the Commission found that the complainant, a black automotive technician, was subject to race discrimination when he was suspended for seven days after failing a blood alcohol test. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that two white automotive technicians were not similarly situated because they had a different supervisor finding that the discipline was decided by a common second-level supervisor. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ferrell</span> also relied upon the disparity in the respective disciplinary actions in finding discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that in order for comparative evidence relating to other employees to be considered relevant, all relevant aspects of the employees' work situations must be identical or nearly identical, i.e., that the employees report to the same supervisor, perform the same job function, and work during the same time periods. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Department of Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A22092 (March 13, 2003); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A02890 (June 27, 2001); <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983491 (April 13, 2000). In this case, the record reflects that the immediate supervisor of the white comparators identified by complainant was S2, a different supervisor than S1. However, the record reflects that the DM was the second line supervisor for complainant and the two white employees identified by complainant. The record further reflects that the DM stated in his affidavit that he was "the decision maker who applied the policy to [CW1]." DM Affidavit at 2. The DM stated that he had no recollection of CW2, although the DM does not contest that CW2 is his subordinate. As such, we find that complainant's work situation, especially in light of the fact that the DM approved the disciplinary actions at issue, were nearly identical such that complaint showed that CW1 and CW2 were similarly situated. Accordingly, complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> of race discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency that it has the authority to discipline employees who fail to comply with the agency's prohibition on alcohol use; however, the agency may not do so in a discriminatory manner. We find that complainant established that the agency's reason for issuing him a seven day suspension was a pretext for race discrimination. Specifically, we find that the agency issued disparate levels of discipline to white employees compared to complainant. The record shows that CW1 was initially recommended to be removed, but the record is silent as to whether any further discipline was implemented after his first offense. CW1 was only issued a Notice of Removal after he failed a second BAT test over one year later. The record also shows that with regard to CW2, after his first failed BAT, he was initially issued a Letter of Warning. In contrast, after complainant's first offense, he was issued a seven day suspension. Although the DM stated in his affidavit that CW1 was also given seven day suspensions, there is nothing in the record to corroborate this. Also, the DM stated in his affidavit that the suspensions were reduced as a result of CW1 and CW2 filing grievances; however, the issue is not how the grievance reduced their discipline but rather what discipline the agency issued to the comparators after their first offense. The discipline issued to complainant and his comparators was so disparate in nature that we must conclude that complainant's race actually motivated S1 and DM. We reiterate that complainant received a seven day suspension, whereas neither CW1 nor CW2 received such severe disciplinary action after their first offense. Therefore, the Commission determines that the record reveals that complainant's race "actually motivated the [agency's] decision." <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 141 (2000) (<span class="Italic">citing Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins</span>, 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993)). Accordingly, we find that complainant established that the agency's proffered reason for the discrepancy in discipline was pretext for race discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though disciplinary action arises out of essentially the same set of facts and circumstances, that does not mean that all employees involved are similarly situated for disciplinary purposes. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03940034 (1994), the Commission found that there was no <span id="Page_691"></span>comparison where the appellant engaged in sexual harassment and was downgraded and suspended for 30 days, and his supervisors were suspended for 14 days for failure to initiate prompt investigation and take remedial action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For employees to be considered similarly situated with regard to disciplinary action, the caselaw has held that all relevant aspects of petitioner's employment situation must be nearly identical to those named as comparatives<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Payne v. Illinois Central R.R.</span>, 665 F. Supp. 1308, 1333 (W.D. Tenn. 1987). That is, to be similarly situated, the employees named as comparatives must have reported to the same supervisor; must have been subject to the same standards governing discipline; and, must have been engaged in conduct similar to petitioner's without differentiating or mitigating circumstances distinguishing their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it<span class="Italic">. See Mazella v. RCA Global Communications, Inc.</span>, 642 F. Supp. 1531, 1547 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 814 F.2d 653 (2d Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Woods v. Milner</span>, 760 F. Supp. 623, 645 (E.D. Mich. 1991). The Commission's decisions likewise have held that to be considered similarly situated, the named comparative must have come under the same manager's supervision; have performed the same job function; and, have been disciplined during roughly the same time period<span class="Italic">. See O'Neal v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910490 (July 23, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether misconduct is sufficiently similar for comparative purposes, generalizations about the conduct are of little help. A supervisor who exhibits poor supervisory skills by being verbally abusive and overbearing has not engaged in misconduct similar to a supervisor who engages in inappropriate physical touching of female subordinates. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barr v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 03930173 (1994). Although both employees engaged in what can generally be characterized as offensive conduct toward subordinates, the nature of the specific conduct is different enough that it provides a legitimate reason for disparate discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing discipline for like offenses, the investigatory record must contain sufficient evidence to assess the relative seriousness of the conduct involved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCoy v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01912699 (1991). In <span class="Italic">McCoy</span>, the appellant was removed for use of profanity and insubordination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ccordingly, the regulatorily required "thorough review" should reveal information sufficient for a reviewer to determine the seriousness of the conduct of all relevant employees, so that he can compare the degrees of seriousness.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission agreed that the complainant's conduct was less serious than that of a comparison employee who was removed for profanity and striking a supervisor. However, it was unable to determine whether the complainant's conduct was more serious than that of a comparison employee who received lesser discipline for use of profanity. The case was remanded for further development on the use of profanity by the second comparison employee, as well as the use of profanity in the workplace generally.</p>
<p class="noindent">A difference in the treatment of employees can be established by the timing of discipline. Further, when the issue of penalty similarity involves a situation where the discipline oriGINAlly imposed is subsequently overturned, it can be significant as to whether it was overturned by the MSPB or in the negotiated grievance procedure. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Overby v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924426 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[H]owever, appellant has failed to establish that she was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside of her protected group. Appellant cited three comparison employees who were reinstated by the agency after their removals. However, it is noted that all three comparison employees were initially issued notices of removal for their actions. In addition, for the purposes of inferring disparate treatment under Title VII, all relevant aspects of appellant's employment situation must be "nearly identical" to those of the comparative employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Payne v. Illinois Central R.R.</span>, 665 F. Supp. 1038 (W.D. Tenn. 1987). Thus, in order to be similarly situated, comparative employees must have reported to the same supervisor, been subjected to the same standards governing discipline, and engaged in conduct similar to appellant's without differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it. <span class="Italic">Mazzella v. RCA Global Communications Inc.</span>, 642 F. Supp. 1531 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 814 F.2d 653 (2nd Cir. 1987). In addition, the Commission has held that comparative employees must have come under the same manager's supervision, performed the same job functions, been on the same tour, and been disciplined during roughly the same time period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910490 (July 23, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, only Comparison 3 can arguably be considered similarly situated, since she was the only one removed for falsification of medical documentation. However, none of the comparison employees cited by appellant were under the supervision of appellant's Supervisor at the time of their removals. In addition, all three comparison employees were removed at least one year prior to appellant. Appellant argued that she was treated less favorably by the agency because while the comparison employees were reinstated after their removals, she was not reinstated. The AJ noted that Comparison 3 could be considered similarly situated, since her removal was rescinded as the result of a settlement agreement. However, the record reveals that all three of the comparison employees, including Comparison 3, grieved their removals through the union grievance process, while appellant relied on the EEO process. In addition, Comparison 3's settlement was approved by a Labor Relations Representative, and there is no evidence that that individual had any authority to settle appellant's complaint. It is noted that the Commission has found that comparison employees were not similarly situated where the comparisons chose to pursue their removals through the Merit Systems Protection Board, while the complainant utilized the union grievance process. <span class="Italic">O'Neal</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Therefore, we find that appellant has failed to demonstrate that she was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside of her protected group, and, as such, has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The number of times a complainant is involved in an incident that could or did lead to disciplinary action is also relevant in such cases. In <span class="Italic">Colene M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000924 (2021), for instance, the agency issued a letter of warning to the complainant for an "industrial accident" that occurred. The Commission distinguished between the complainant, who had five accidents, and the cited comparator employees, who each only had one:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for issuing the May 11, 2017 LOW following Complainant's accident were that the LOW was an act of progressive discipline for Complainant's involvement in a preventable accident, and, Complainant failed to follow the reporting procedure for on the job accidents. Specifically, S1 testifies that the procedure is to contact your supervisor immediately after an accident. PM reasoned that because the April 11, 2017 accident was her second industrial accident in less than a year, following multiple nondisciplinary corrective actions, it was appropriate for S1 to take progressive disciplinary action by issuing the May 11, 2017 LOW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues questions of material fact exist as to whether the accident on April 11, 2017 was preventable, and if she failed to follow instructions. While Complainant's right ankle may have been particularly susceptible to injury, the manner in which she sustained the injury, stepping backward off of a curb, was preventable. As for failure to follow instructions, S1's assertion that Complainant did not report the accident with sufficient immediacy is less supported by the record. Only 15 minutes passed between when the April 11, 2017 accident occurred and when she reported it. The Agency has not provided a policy that states that an employee must call management when an accident occurred, or shown her the specific instruction it states that she failed to follow. In a grievance she filed over the same event, Complainant asserts that there is no rule that you must report an accident within a certain number of minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the time it took to report her accident is not necessarily material to whether the LOW was issued in a discriminatory manner because the Agency also cites progressive discipline as its legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for issuing the LOW, which is consistent with its internal policies and its agreement with the Union. Complainant has not demonstrated that the Agency's explanation was pretext for a discriminatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of establishing pretext, comparative evidence relating to other employees is considered relevant when they are similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A22092 (Mar. 13, 2003). In other words, all relevant aspects of the employees' work situation are identical or nearly identical, i.e., the employees report to the same supervisor, perform the same job function, work during the same time periods, and, in instances where the Agency is responding to problem conduct (e.g. attendance deficiencies), engaged in the same conduct. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A02890 (Jun. 27, 2001), <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01983491 (Apr. 13, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For claims where the alleged discriminatory action is an agency's response to problem conduct, where the proffered comparator's conduct was materially distinguishable from that of complainant, he or she is not similarly situated to Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Grappone v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC No. 01A10667 (Sept. 7, 2001) <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied, </span>EEOC Request No. 05A20020 (Dec. 28, 2002) (comparator's conduct was materially distinguishable from that of the complainant where the comparator was disciplined for not routinely requesting identification of all customers, while complainant had not requested identification and had actually served alcohol to minors), <span class="Italic">see also Complainant v. Dep't of the Treas</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120132983 (Jun. 10, 2015) (comparator and complainant were subject to different disciplinary actions because they committed different infractions, which rendered two different disciplinary findings).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant names five comparator employees, ("C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5," Black/African American) who were also City Carriers and reported to S1. Complainant asserts that all five were similarly situated because they engaged in the same problem conduct, as she did, since all were involved in on the job accidents. According to Complainant, her <span id="Page_692"></span>comparators were treated more favorably by management because they were not subjected to an investigative interview or issued a LOW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have also determined that to be considered similarly situated, the comparator must be similar in substantially all aspects, so that it would be expected that they would be treated in the same manner. <span class="Italic">Grappone</span>. Three out of Complainant's five proffered comparators have only one accident on their records for the period of January 1, 2012 through December 2017. As the Agency contends the LOW was progressive discipline, it would not be expected that these individuals would have been treated in the same manner upon receiving their first accident as Complainant, whose most recent accident was her fifth on record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant recounts that C1 hurt her knee while on her route, C2 injured herself when she stepped in a hole on her route, and C3 twisted her ankle, all of which constitute preventable accidents like the one Complainant experienced on April 11, 2017. However, PM's testimony differentiates C4 and C5's problem conduct as accidents involving factors outside their control (an unidentified substance leaking from a package, and getting chased by aggressive dogs).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, it would be expected that C4 and C5 would be treated in the same manner as Complainant, so they cannot be considered comparator employees. Alternately, both C4 and C5 could not be comparators because they have only one accident on their records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency differentiates Complainant's conduct from that of C1, C2, and C3 by noting that Complainant was involved in five industrial accidents between January 1, 2012 and December 2017. Also, unlike her comparators, Complainant was involved in two accidents in less than a year. As the Agency was applying progressive discipline, it would not be expected that the Agency would issue a LOW to C1 who was involved in three accidents, C2, who was involved in one accident, and C3, who was involved in two accidents, where Complainant received her first LOW for accidents after her fifth preventable accident, and second in less than a year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not shown that her proffered comparators were similarly situated to her in order to establish that the Agency's stated reasons for issuing the LOW were pretext for discrimination based on race. Additionally, complainant failed to present evidence that more likely than not, the agency's articulated reasons for its actions were a pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even construing any inferences raised by the undisputed facts in favor of Complainant, a reasonable fact-finder could not find in Complainant's favor.</p>
