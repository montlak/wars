<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-133"><span class="space">8.</span> Racist Symbols</h4>
<p class="noindent">The concept of a hostile environment extends to verbal and physical conduct, which means that it also extends to the display of racist symbols in the workplace even if not accompanied by any verbal conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Posey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986619 (2001), the Commission found that a single instance where a hangman's noose was hung near a black complainant's work station was sufficient to create a hostile environment. However, the Commission found there was no basis for imputing liability to the agency where it promptly conducted an investigation into the incident, the offender received a seven-day suspension, and the agency posted notices reflecting a "zero tolerance" policy for racial harassment. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">Jed. T. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120142625 (2015), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Juergensen v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073331 (October 5, 2007) (a hangman's noose is a "highly charged and powerful symbol in the history of this country, calling up painful memories of the lynching of thousands of African Americans."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120112360 (2013) (single noose incident created hostile environment but agency took prompt and effective corrective action); <span class="Italic">Tootle v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A40127 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120093174 (2011), the Commission did not agree with the complainant that a 14-inch piece of string placed on a clip and hung from a display counter represented a hangman's noose and, as a result, was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">King</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the evidence of record simply does not support a finding that events occurred as Complainant perceived them. While Complainant appears genuine in her belief that there was a noose placed in the store, the weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the 14-inch string found on the floor by another employee and placed on a clip on the counter was intended to represent a hangman's noose. Based on the evidence of record, it is more likely than not that the string, a military 550 cord used to tie a jacket or pack, was inadvertently dropped on the floor of the store by a shopper and then picked by SA and placed on the counter. The record further shows that GM did respond promptly to Complainant's report of a noose by initiating an internal investigation of the matter, as well as a criminal (CID) investigation. Neither investigation found evidence to support a finding that the string was a noose or was intended to convey any racial animus. Complainant has not produced evidence to dispute the findings of these investigations. Even accepting Complainant's version of her meetings with GM as true, while some of his statements may have been insensitive to her concerns and distress over the incident, we cannot find that his actions were sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment for Complainant. We note, for example, that although GM terminated the meeting with her because he alleged she was verbally abusive, he neither took, nor threatened to take, any adverse action against her because of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120141244 (2014), the Commission rejected an agency argument that two noose incidents were not racially motivated but just coworkers playing a prank on another coworker. It further rejected an agency argument that comments about President Obama were politically and not racially motived. The Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying this standard, we find that the evidence of record supports Complainant's claim of two "noose" incidents, as well as a working environment where Complainant was subjected to derogatory comments and racially inflammatory statements occurring from the spring of 2008 to July 2009. The FBI, however, argues in its September 30, 2013 decision that the offending FBI agents were not motivated by Complainant's race when, in two separate incidents, they hung a noose in Complainant's work area. The FBI claims that the incidents were mere pranks directed at another employee and not at Complainant based on his race. The FBI also determined that the remarks by agents concerning the 2008 presidential election and candidate Barack Obama were not racially motivated. The FBI argues that the agents merely expressed their opposition to a particular political candidate and that their comments were not a result of any animus toward Complainant's protected class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the FBI's position. In limited circumstances, the Commission has held that certain events, by themselves, may support a finding of discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Juergensen v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073331 (Oct. 5, 2007) (a hangman's noose is "a highly charged and powerful symbol in the history of this country, calling up painful memories of the lynching of thousands of African Americans"); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996). Moreover, the record is clear that derogatory and racially inflammatory language, including the use of a highly charged racial epithet (the n-word), was openly used by the FBI agents in Complainant's presence. Moreover, the fact that the remark was not specifically directed toward complainant is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Barber, Eley, Powell and Johnson v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Requests Nos. 05A50657, 05A50771, 05A50972, 05A50973 (March 16, 2006). Therefore, we find that the evidence of record supports a finding that Complainant was subjected to a racially hostile work environment while serving on the FBI task force in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this evidence, we find that the FBI failed to take effective steps to ensure that Complainant was not further exposed to the racially charged atmosphere, as well as subjected to retaliatory harassment for reporting the noose incidents. The harassment, in fact, continued when the FBI allowed the offending agents to remain in Complainant's work area, thereby magnifying the already hostile environment to which Complainant was subjected. The record demonstrates that Complainant was subject to retaliatory harassment based on the FBI's failure to remove the offending agents thereby exacerbating the hostile environment. The record established a nexus between his prior protected EEO activity, reporting the noose incidents, and management's failure to remove the agents and end the harassment. Accordingly, we find that the FBI, whose management was in control of the work site and was made aware of the discriminatory hostile work environment, should be held liable for its failure to take prompt and effective corrective action in this matter.

Accordingly, we find that the FBI, whose management was in control of the work site and was made aware of the discriminatory hostile work environment, should be held liable for its failure to take prompt and effective corrective action in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no definitive rule regarding the passage of time between incidents that comprise an alleged hostile environment that would make the incidents sufficiently remote from each other to break any connection. The Commission appears to take a case-by-case approach. For example, in <span class="Italic">Juergensen v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120101504 (2013), the Commission found its administrative judge erred in finding that a noose incident that occurred nearly 11 years prior to the present complaint was beyond the scope of the complaint. In that case, the complainant alleged that a hostile environment was created when the agency in 2007 rehired an individual who had hung a noose in the office in 1996. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Juergensen</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that after a careful review of the record, the AJ erred when she issued a decision without a hearing. The AJ found that because Complainant did not raise the 1996 incident in an EEO complaint, she "[had] no authority to make a determination in this case with regard to how offensive the noose [was] because it is not part of this complaint." We disagree. As a matter of law, the AJ should have looked into the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to have rendered Complainant's work environment hostile.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon finding that the AJ erred by not addressing the noose incident as part of Complainant's overall harassment complaint, at the very least as background evidence, we find that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute such that a hearing is required. For example, Complainant's testimony, contrary to the AJ's determination otherwise, is that the rehiring of GS was: (1) objectively offensive; (2) physically threatening or humiliating; and (3) unreasonably interfered with her work performance. As noted above, Complainant stated that GS' presence makes her feel frustrated, and sometimes makes it difficult for her to focus and concentrate on her work. She further indicated that, as a Black person, she felt that GS' presence symbolizes that our country used lynching to <span id="Page_941"></span>terrorize Blacks. Finally, Complainant indicated that although she knows that lynchings happened in the past, it has been harmful for her to work with someone who would display a noose; especially when it was hung after a coworker "attempted to bring inequality to the attention of our supervisors."</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the decision centered on whether the administrative judge had properly granted summary judgment to the agency, in overturning that ruling, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rosier v. Attorney General</span>, 0120060524 (2007), found that an allegation that a white female was given a "country" towel as a Christmas present while the complainant, a black female, received a "mammie" towel was sufficiently severe or pervasive that it could create a racially hostile environment. The towel apparently displayed a black woman and two black children in a racially insensitive manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">A life-size cut out of "North Korean Dictator" Kim Jung-Un found in the complainant's supervisor's office did not amount to harassment in <span class="Italic">Freddy V. v. Attorney General</span>, 2021003727 (2021). The complainant in that case (Korean) further alleged that he observed pictures of management with the cut-out. The agency defended that the cut-out was placed in the supervisor's office as a joke, that the cut-out was not "inherently racist" and was removed immediately after the complainant expressed his concerns. Noting that the only connection the complainant had to the cut-out was his race, the Commission affirmed dismissal in <span class="Italic">Freddy V</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that S2 had a life-sized cut-out of North Korean leader, Kim Jung-Un, along with several framed pictures of various lieutenants posed with the cut-out in his office. The testimony of the S2 and Complainant's first-level supervisor (S1) (Caucasian) was that the life-sized cut-out was placed in S2's office while he was on vacation in June 2018 and as a joke targeted at S2, comparing him to the dictator. Complainant states that he had a meeting with S2 in his office sometime after S2's vacation, in which the cut-out stood behind S2 and faced Complainant and the pictures were visible on the wall.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that there was nothing inherently racist about the cut-out, which essentially was a realistic photograph of a public figure. Title VII is not meant to be a general civility code that will rid the workplace of all petty slights and annoyances. Rather, "Title VII was enacted to protect against behavior that is based on a protected basis and so severe or offensive as to alter the complainant's working conditions." <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A11221 (May 22, 5 2002). The Agency persuasively argues that the cut-out was not objectively offensive such that it triggered Title VII's protections against discriminatory harassment. Moreover, the only connection Complainant made to his own race during the investigation was to say the cut-out featured a Korean and Complainant was the only employee of Korean descent working at the Manchester FCI. However, the evidence strongly indicates that there was no intent to target Complainant or individuals of Korean descent with the cut-out. Rather, it appears that its placement in S2's office by his subordinate lieutenants was intended as a joke directed at S2, who was not Korean, about his stature and management style. Thus, the record evidence does not affirmatively establish that the asserted harassing conduct was based on Complainant's race. We also note that Complainant has only identified a single incident when he was exposed to the cut-out, making it unlikely that it was sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile work environment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, there is little doubt that Complainant was deeply offended by the presence of the cut-out in the workplace and especially in the office of a management official. He said he believed the cut-out made fun of people like him of Korean descent. Therefore, even assuming the presence of the cut-out was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter Complainant's working conditions, the issue to be determined is whether or not the Agency is liable for the asserted harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998); <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 807 (1998). Where harassment by a supervisor creates an unlawful hostile environment, the employing agency can raise an affirmative defense where the conduct complained of is not a tangible employment action by showing that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassment and that Complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the Agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.2 (Mar. 8, 1994); <span class="Italic">Marielle L. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120162299 (Mar. 29, 2018); <span class="Italic">Joel P. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120162383 (Mar. 5, 2018). Appropriate agency corrective action is that which is reasonably calculated to stop the harassment. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100303 (July 20, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant concedes that as soon as he made his concerns about the cut-out known to the Associate Warden (Caucasian), the cut-out and all photographs of the lieutenants posing with it were immediately (by the next day) removed from the workplace. Complainant admits that at no point prior to complaining to the Associate Warden did he express his concerns to S2, the involved lieutenants or any other Agency official. Complainant also does not assert there were any other incidents of alleged harassment either before or after this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has met its burden of proving its affirmative defense to liability by showing it took prompt and effective action to correct the situation and prevent it from occurring in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dawson v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120114186.txt">0120114186</a> (2012), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint that allowing employees to wear t-shirts with the Confederate flag created a racially hostile environment noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant has alleged that he notified the Postmaster as early as March 2011 of employees repeatedly wearing Confederate flag t-shirts to work, but it was not until May 2011, that the Postmaster finally instructed the supervisor to start sending the employees home to change. Complainant argues that the Postmaster "procrastinated in taking action on my complaint" and that he filed the complaint, in part, because of the Postmaster's "lack of concern for my feelings associated with this matter." Complainant explained that he was offended by the t-shirts because he saw the Confederate flag as a symbol of racism that evoked the history of slavery. Complainant also alleged that he is now fearful of one the employees he complained about because the employee has started parking his car off Agency properly and Complainant believes he might have a weapon in his car.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the circumstances alleged by Complainant, we conclude that he has stated a viable claim of discriminatory harassment which requires further investigation. While isolated incidents may not create a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved, the Commission has held that, under certain circumstances, a limited number of highly offensive slurs related to a federal employee's race may in fact state a claim or support a finding of discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996), Moreover, Complainant has alleged that it took the Postmaster nearly two months to finally take action to stop his coworkers from wearing the offensive t-shirts.</p>
<p class="noindent">After a remand, the Commission reversed the decision of its administrative judge granting summary judgment to the agency and granted summary judgment in the complainant's favor. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132144 (2013), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined, and the undisputed evidence of record supports, that two clerks working in Complainant's workplace ("Clerk 1 and 2"; both Caucasian) wore t-shirts to work featuring the confederate flag on August 29, 2010; November 15, 2010; January 24, 2011; January 31, 2011; February 14, 2011; February 28, 2011; March 12, 2011; March 25, 2011; March 26, 2011; March 29, 2011; April 7, 2011; April 20, 2011; April 25, 2011; and May 3, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 15, 2011, the Union President, on behalf of Complainant, informed the Postmaster (Caucasian) that "some employees" found the t-shirts offensive and requested that management take immediate action to prohibit these t-shirts in the workplace. The Postmaster claims he then directed a subordinate supervisor to conduct a stand-up talk for all employees concerning workplace attire. While it is unclear when this talk occurred, it is undisputed that there was no mention of Confederate flag symbols. Instead, employees were told not to wear revealing clothing or clothing with "political" messages. In his affidavit made during the investigation, the Postmaster specifically confirms that employees were never instructed not to wear or display images of the Confederate flag.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 18, 2011, the Union President followed up with a letter to the Postmaster that was hand-delivered by an agency employee. A statement from that employee indicates that the Postmaster opened the letter in his presence and asked who was complaining about the t-shirts. Clerk 1 was also in the Postmaster's office at the time, wearing a t-shirt featuring the Confederate flag on the back. The Postmaster, according to the witness, asked Clerk 1 to turn around and then said, "there is nothing wrong with this shirt." The Postmaster then asked the witness if Complainant was the one complaining about the shirts. In his affidavit taken during the investigation, the Postmaster essentially confirms the correctness of the witness' account. He said that he remembered saying that he was not bothered by Clerk l's shirt and did not find it to be "political" and was "not certain what rights [Clerk 1 had] to wear the shirt."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 3, 2011, the same day Complainant filed a grievance over the Confederate shirts, the Postmaster sent Clerk 1, who was wearing a Confederate flag shirt, home to change. The record shows that Clerk 1 also later filed a grievance over being sent home. Records from that grievance show that matter was settled by paying Clerk 1 for the time he was sent home because he had not previously been instructed that wearing Confederate symbols was prohibited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the record, we find that the AJ erred as a matter of law in determining that despite finding Complainant was subjected <span id="Page_942"></span>to racial harassment, the Agency was not liable because management took immediate and appropriate corrective action. As noted in the above recitation of the undisputed evidence, management failed to take any action to prohibit the wearing or displaying of the Confederate flag when it first was notified of the concern in March 2011. While the AJ pointed to a stand-up talk on work attire as a corrective step, the evidence clearly establishes that clothing with Confederate symbols was not discussed at this talk. In fact, the Postmaster expressly concedes employees were never instructed not to wear or display images of the Confederate flag. Moreover, the evidence shows that the Postmaster, in fact, exacerbated the situation in mid-April 2011, upon receiving a follow-up complaint about the Confederate flag shirts, by examining Clerk 1, who was wearing the shirt, and letting him know, as well as another witness, that there was "nothing wrong" with wearing the shirt. In fact, the Postmaster took no action to address the issue for nearly two months, until prompted by Complainant filing a union grievance over the matter in May 2011. It was only at this point that the Postmaster sent Clerk 1 home to change. Based on this evidence, we conclude that the Agency has failed to meet its burden of establishing its affirmative defense against liability in this matter. Accordingly, we reverse the AJ's conclusion to the contrary. As such, we conclude that Complainant has established that he was subjected to unlawful harassment based on race and the Agency is liable for the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141334 (2014), the Commission found that a hat with a rattlesnake bearing the motto "Don't Tread on Me" was racially offensive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that Complainant was rendered aggrieved by his claim relating to the hat worn by another employee, which Complainant alleged contained a racially offensive slogan. Complainant further alleged that he unsuccessfully complained to Agency management, but the employee was not stopped from continuing to wear the offensive cap to work. Complainant further alleged that management took no effective action in response to his complaints in retaliation for his prior EEO activity. In sum, we find that this allegation constitutes a cognizable claim of harassment under the EEOC regulations. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132144 (November 1, 2013) (management's failure to stop employees from wearing t-shirts featuring the Confederate flag constituted a viable claim of racial and retaliatory harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency requested reconsideration of that decision in <span class="Italic">Shelton D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520140441 (2016), arguing that the "Don't Tread on Me" slogan has not been historically associated with discriminatory animus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request for reconsideration, the Agency maintains that our previous decision was clearly erroneous and should be reversed. Specifically, the Agency argues that the Gadsden Flag and its "Don't Tread on Me" slogan do not have any racial connotations. The Agency maintains that historians indicate that Benjamin Franklin made an early reference to rattlesnakes in 1751 when he stated that colonists should release rattlesnakes in various locations in London as a response to the Crown's practice of shipping convicts to the colonies. The Agency further maintains that the yellow flag with the coiled rattlesnake and "Don't Tread on Me" slogan was suggested by Colonel Christopher Gadsden of the American Revolutionary War's Continental Army to Commodore Esek Hopkins, the commanding officer of the first warship of the Continental Navy, and that Hopkins flew the flag on his warship during naval actions against Britain. The Agency asserts that this naval ensign morphed into a striped flag with a rattlesnake and the "Don't Tread on Me" slogan. The Agency contends that there is no evidence "whatsoever" that the Gadsden Flag historically was a symbol of racism, beyond Complainant's bare assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Agency maintains that Complainant's claim that Christopher Gadsden traded and owned slaves does not make the flag racist because Gadsden's "personal business" had nothing to do with the flag. The Agency also points out that there is scholarly work that indicates that Gadsden did not trade slaves, although there is evidence that he owned them. The Agency further contends that the Commission's comparison of the Gadsden flag to the Confederate Battle Flag is inapposite because the Confederate Battle Flag was "clearly a symbol of a political structure which supported and defended slavery," whereas the Gadsden Flag "had nothing whatsoever to do with slavery or racism." The Agency asserts that Complainant's perception that the Gadsden Flag is a symbol of racism is based on "ignorance of history."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, Complainant maintains that we should deny the Agency's request for reconsideration. Complainant maintains that the Gadsden Flag is a "historical indicator of white resentment against blacks stemming largely from the Tea Party." He notes that the Vice President of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters cited the Gadsden Flag as the equivalent of the Confederate Battle Flag when he successfully had it removed from a New Haven, Connecticut fire department flagpole.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission denied the agency's request for reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Shelton D.,</span> but noted that more information was necessary regarding the specific context in which the coworker displayed the symbol in the workplace in order to determine whether the symbol was meant to convey a racially charged message:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, it is clear that the Gadsden Flag oriGINAted in the Revolutionary War in a non-racial context. Moreover, it is clear that the flag and its slogan have been used to express various non-racial sentiments, such as when it is used in the modern Tea Party political movement, guns rights activism, patriotic displays, and by the military. However, whatever the historic origins and meaning of the symbol, it also has since been sometimes interpreted to convey racially-tinged messages in some contexts. For example, in June 2014, assailants with connections to white supremacist groups draped the bodies of two murdered police officers with the Gadsden flag during their Las Vegas, Nevada shooting spree. Additionally, in 2014, African-American New Haven firefighters complained about the presence of the Gadsden flag in the workplace on the basis that the symbol was racially insensitive. Certainly, Complainant ascribes racial connotations to the symbol based on observations that it is sometimes displayed in racially-tinged situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the ambiguity in the current meaning of this symbol, we find that Complainant's claim must be investigated to determine the specific context in which C1 displayed the symbol in the workplace. In so finding, we are not prejudging the merits of Complainant's complaint. Instead, we are precluding a procedural dismissal that would deprive us of evidence that would illuminate the meaning conveyed by C1's display of the symbol. Additionally, we note that in order to determine whether an actionable claim of harassment exists, the Agency must view the allegedly harassing incidents in the light most favorable to Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Cobb v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970077 (Mar. 13, 1997). Therefore, we find that our previous determination reversing the Agency's dismissal was not erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the previous decision and the entire record, the Commission finds that the request fails to meet the criteria of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(c), and it is the decision of the Commission to DENY the request. The decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120141334 remains the Commission's decision. There is no further right of administrative appeal on the decision of the Commission on this request. The Agency shall comply with the Order as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A32709 (2003), the Commission found that one incident was not sufficiently severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment where the complainant alleged that he saw a shirt in his supervisor's office with a bulldog and Confederate flag that said, "Smile when you say redneck." The Commission examines the totality of the circumstances in determining if a hostile environment has been created even in cases where blatantly racist language or symbols are used. For example, in <span class="Italic">Glass v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120072972 (2010), the Commission agreed with its administrative judge that an email sent to a black employee by her supervisor that was entitled, "If the South ruled the Country" and contained images of the Confederate flag and the Ku Klux Klan was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. The Commission found that the judge determined the supervisor credibly testified that he had sent the email to the complainant instead of his wife by mistake, had apologized to the complainant when he discovered the mistake and was reprimanded by the agency for his actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that is somewhat surprising, the Commission found that the complainant had not demonstrated that alleged comments, such as "honkey" and "redneck" were based on his race. <span class="Italic">Locket v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11239 (2002). One suspects the <span class="Italic">Locket</span> decision reflects some sloppy analysis since those terms would ordinarily be associated exclusively with Caucasians because the Commission also found that the complainant was not a party to the alleged conversations and that, in any event, the number of incidents was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. But there is no requirement that the complainant demonstrate the conduct is based on minority status. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080614 (2008) (complainant alleged he was called a "'white ass,' 'damn white ass,' 'a damn white ass cracker,' 'redneck,' and told him to get his 'white ass back where he came from.'"); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064052 (2007) (single incident where complainant was called "fucking white boy" and "neo-Nazi white boy" sufficient to state claim of hostile racial environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Apple v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120113981 (2012), the Commission found that the complainant failed to state a claim where she alleged on one occasion that she was approached by a supervisor and asked in front of coworkers why she was having "a black girls' lunch" and that he resented being excluded.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Richard v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A05007 (2000), the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim of racial harassment based on the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[C]omplainant has listed various incidents of harassment in addition to the note on complainant's car which stated (in all capital letters):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We will get rid of you to [sic] [racially derogatory term], You think [person's name] likes you. Fool! Stupid! And more stupid!</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_943"></span>Unfortunately, the Commission failed to give any indication in <span class="Italic">Richard</span> as to what the other incidents of harassment were that, in combination with the racial slur, gave rise to the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">While one specific incident involving a racial slur may, given the circumstances, be egregious enough to constitute a violation of Title VII, more often the complaint is that a series of lesser incidents creates a hostile working environment. In <span class="Italic">Criner v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05880097 (1988), the Commission gave the following explanation of when the level of racial comments reaches that of a hostile work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 702(a)(1) of the Title VII, 42 USCA 2000e-e(a)(1), provides that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race...." Such language evidences a Congressional intention to define discrimination in broad terms which encompass more than "bread and butter issues"; thus, "an employee [sic] violates Title VII simply by creating or condoning an environment at the workplace which significantly and adversely affects [the psychological well-being of] an employee because of his race or ethnicity, regardless of any other tangible job detriment to the employee." <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 901 (11th Cir. 1982). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motors Co.</span>, 684 F.2d 1355 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Calcote v. Texas Educational Foundation, Inc.</span>, 458 F. Supp. 231 (W.D. Tex.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 578 F.2d 95 (5th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 235 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, if a working environment is found to be dominated by racial hostility and harassment, a violation of Title VII is found, regardless of whether the complainant can establish any tangible job detriment attributable to racial animus. As noted by the court in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bunny Bread Co.</span>, 646 F.2d 1250, 1257 (8th Cir. 1981):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Unquestionably, a working environment dominated by racial slurs constitutes a violation of Title VII. This is not to say, however, that all racial slurs rise to the level of a Title VII violation. In this area, we deal with a matter of degrees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is, however, clear that more than a few isolated instances of racial slurs or harassment must have occurred before a hostile or offensive work environment in violation of Title VII will be found. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Murphy Motor Freight</span>, 488 F. Supp. 381 (D. Minn. 1980). "Whether the degree of harassment is sufficiently severe and persistent to trigger Title VII sanctions is to be determined from the totality of the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. City of Little Rock, Ark.</span>, 722 F.2d 1390, 1394 (8th Cir. 1983). Thus, where derogatory racial comments are pervasive, opprobrious, repeated and wide-spread, resulting in an atmosphere charged with racist overtones and racial tensions, a Title VII violation is found. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (repeated use of racial epithets or racially derogatory terms by a number of personnel); <span class="Italic">Snell v. Suffolk County</span>, 611 F. Supp. 521 (D.C.N.Y. 1985) (coworkers' continuing verbal abuse, derogatory mimicking, and circulation of racist material).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where only a small number of personnel are found to have made derogatory comments or racial slurs in isolated, sporadic incidents, the workplace will not be found to be tainted by a hostile or offensive atmosphere in violation of Title VII<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Cariddi v. Kansas City Chiefs Football Club, Inc.</span>, 568 F.2d 87 (8th Cir. 1977) (derogatory comments made by a supervisor in causal conversation); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bunny Bread Co.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (infrequent use of racial slurs in casual conversations and not purposefully in plaintiff's presence); <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Best Foods</span>, 598 F. Supp. 159 (E.D. Ark. 1984) (racial remarks sporadic and confined to relatively few employees); <span class="Italic">Pierson v. Norcliff Thayer, Inc.</span>, 605 F. Supp. 273 (E.D. Mo. 1985) (plaintiff could point to only four instances of racially derogatory language).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Criner</span>, while the Commission condemned the subject remarks as "reprehensible and inexcusable," it found that the remarks of one individual, outside of the presence of the complainant, to no more than a few other individuals did not constitute a hostile or offensive work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the complainant may have retired from the agency after filing his complaint, this does not necessarily render the complaint moot. The agency still has an obligation to eradicate the use of racial epithets and derogatory comments from the workplace. <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05910499 (1991). In addition, with the availability of compensatory damages, a complaint is not moot even if the complainant retires, as long as compensatory damages were requested.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that all of the racial slurs be directed at the complainant in order to create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Carter v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A55797 (2006), the complainant alleged that a coworker used the word "nigger" in telling a joke to fellow coworker. The complainant then discussed the incident with the Postmaster who told her that it was no "big deal" because the coworker was telling joke. He also said, "If I say you're a nigger and I can't stand your black ass...that would be different." In a subsequent discussion with the complainant, he repeated the comment, this time using her name. The Commission found that the complainant had stated a claim of hostile environment harassment based on race, even though not all of the comments were actually directed at her.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in two companion cases, <span class="Italic">Adams v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073776 (2007) and <span class="Italic">Lofton, et al v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073757 (2007), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of racial harassment claims involving some 20 complainants where not all of the comments and actions had been directed at each complainant. In <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Commission determines that the agency mis-defined the instant complaint. We find that a fair reading of the formal complaint reflects a broader claim of a hostile work environment, rather than a singular claim simply regarding the August 12, 2002 incident. Instead, the record contains several examples of racist comments and threats of violence by JB. JB allegedly said that all blacks are no good, that the agency needed to get rid of all blacks, and that he hated blacks. Further, he called the crew names such as "nigger" and "big lips." JB also purportedly threatened to hit a crew member with a block of wood he was holding, and ran after another individual, also threatening to hit him. The complaint states that "[t]he crew lived in constant fear of what hateful and humiliating acts this drunken racist would inflict on us."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that while JB's remarks and threats were not specifically directed to complainant, he has presented an actionable hostile work environment claim. The Commission has previously noted that the use of the racial epithet "nigger" is a "highly charged epithet" which "dredge[s] up the entire history of racial discrimination in this country." <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996). Moreover, the fact that complainant was not present when the remarks were made is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Barber, Eley, Powell, and Johnson v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request Nos. 05A50657, 05A50771, 05A50972, 05A50973 (The Commission on its own motion reversed the dismissal of <span class="Italic">Powell</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> finding that the combined claims of racially offensive remarks, the use of the term "nigger," and disparate treatment in work assignments was sufficient to state a claim) <span class="Italic">citing Spriggs v. Diamond Auto Glass,</span> 242 F.3d 179, 185-86 (4th Cir. 2001) (racial harassment not directed specifically at plaintiff, but part of plaintiff's work environment, could be actionable). We find that the events described in the record are sufficiently severe and pervasive to have created an abusive environment and interfered with complainant's work performance. The instant complaint states a claim of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson, et al. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120073487 (2007) ("the fact that a complainant learns second hand of a racially derogatory comment by a co-worker can impact the work environment.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Juergensen v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120073331 (2007), the Commission found that a black complainant stated a claim for relief where she alleged that a white employee who had previously engaged in racial harassment was rehired to work in her office. The employee provided a transcript of testimony in a previous EEO complaint involving a black employee in another office indicating that the rehired employee had placed a hangman's noose over a desk. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Juergensen</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that, if proven true, complainant's allegations are sufficiently severe to set forth an actionable claim of hostile work environment based on race. Specifically, complainant has alleged that agency management negligently exposed her to the danger of a racially hostile work environment by knowingly placing an employee in her office who had previously committed an openly racist act against an African American coworker. Moreover, this prior incident involved a noose--a highly charged and powerful symbol in the history of this country, calling up painful memories of the lynching of thousands of African Americans. The Supreme Court has stated that the "primary objective" of Title VII is "to avoid harm." <span class="Italic">Farragher v. City of Boca Raton,</span> 524 U.S. 775, 806 (1998). As a result, an employer is liable under Title VII for failing to prevent racially hostile or offensive work environments which it knows about or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should know about.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of racial slurs by a supervisor can rise to the level of creating intolerable working conditions that would cause a reasonable person to resign. In <span class="Italic">Burns v. General Services Administration</span>, 01912767 (1992), the Commission found intolerable conditions to exist where the supervisors referred to black employees as "nigger" and "Sambo" and made statements to the effect that "he would get rid of his nigger problem" and the complainant's coworkers were aware the supervisor was using such language. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, the complainant was passed over for several promotions. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01961027 (1998) (isolated comments about Black ministers do not create hostile environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of a racial slur, coupled with conduct that is not overtly racial, may properly lead to the conclusion that the conduct is based on race. For example, in <span class="Italic">Winston v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01985752 (2000), the supervisor referred to the complainant as a "black bitch" and "essentially put complainant under a microscope, severely restricting her day-to-day activities, subjecting her to extremely close scrutiny, documenting every late arrival down to the minute, and causing her to experience severe stress from the embarrassment and humiliation that she experienced in front of her co-workers." The Commission found that the racial remark, coupled with the <span id="Page_944"></span>"draconian nature" of the other conduct, demonstrated that the harassment was based on race.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sorensen v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120092332 (2009), the Commission found that while expressions such as "you people" and a reference to cornbread might be subject to interpretation, when coupled with clearly racial epithets were indicative of racial motivation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bryant &#x0026; Kelly v. Attorney General,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/07A40098_07A40108.txt">07A40108</a>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/07A40098_07A40108.txt">07A40098</a> (2004), the Commission found that a racially hostile environment was created where two memoranda depicting blacks as ignorant and uneducated were posted on a bulletin board:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that, by memorandum dated June 23, 2002, the Union Vice President (UVP) (African-American) submitted a memorandum to the facility's warden (the Warden) regarding the denial of promotion to GS-8 for the UVP, both complainants, and one other African-American employee. This June 23 memorandum was altered twice by an unidentified person(s).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first altered memorandum was placed in three African-American officers' mailboxes, including that of each of the complainants and the UVP, in the Correctional Services Department and on bulletin boards for staff to read. This memorandum, distributed and posted on June 30, read:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I am offering to withdraw any all paperwork I've filed against the Warden and the Captain if you be willin' to promote me to the GS-8 wit full access to porn sites at work and give my partner more comfortable mattress in da SHU. Give Bryant what she wants too or I file more paper on you.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The UVP averred that he showed two lieutenants (the Lieutenants) the first memorandum. Kelly Report of Investigation (ROI), Exh. 12, at 2. Reportedly, one Lieutenant stated that the UVP might be held responsible for the memorandum since his name appeared on it.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The record reflects that the agency took no action at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sometime after June 30 and before July 3, a second altered memorandum was posted, stating (errors in oriGINAl):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This is the official responses to a falsification memo that went out on me asking for my G-S-8 in return for dropping all charges that I made up on the captain and the warden and the leutenantis. I didn't do that memo. Somebody made a copy of my last memo and unilaterally and deliberately made up the falsification charge on me. The evidence shows that I only asked for myself to get G-S-8, I didn't ask for acess to porn webt sites from wok and I didn't aks for another mattress for my partner and I didn't ask for anything for Bryant. Evidence and personal opinion shows she is working for both sides anyway. I know some of the other officers are made at me, mostly white, for doing this union things but I'll get out of it as soon as I get G-S-8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Warden testified that, once he became aware of the memorandum, he opened an investigation with SIS. Bryant ROI, Exh. 6, at 2. He also responded with a July 12 memorandum, stating that he would not "tolerate [the] alteration of memos or manipulations or falsifications of memos." Kelly ROI, Exh. 6, at 3-4. He further averred that he interviewed staff in an attempt to figure out who was responsible, but the agency could not identify the perpetrator(s).<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The SIS Lieutenant testified that he has never been assigned to investigate the memorandum issue, and "there was no investigation done on it." Bryant ROI, Exh. 8, at 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we discern no basis to disturb the AJ's finding of discrimination or the ordered relief. We find sufficient evidence in the record to support complainants' contentions that they were subjected to harassment that constituted a hostile work environment. The record reflects that complainants are members of a statutorily protected group, and the reference in the memoranda to each of the complainants and two other African-American employees, and the language used in it designed to depict ignorant African-Americans by using stereotypical ebonies, supports an inference of discrimination based on race. In addition, the record reflects that complainants were made a target of these materials because of their race, and that the use of these memoranda directed at complainants and posted in common areas was sufficiently severe to render the work environment hostile. The Commission notes that, evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the complainants' circumstances, the materials were offensive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute with respect to the agency's investigation. The record reflects that the agency knew of the hostile work environment created by complainants' coworkers, but failed to take effective remedial action to end the harassment. Although the agency contends that it acted properly once notified of these memoranda, the record reflects that the agency knew of the hostile work environment created by complainants' coworkers through the memorandum on June 30, but it failed to take prompt, effective remedial action to end the harassment at that time, and another memorandum was distributed and posted sometime before July 3. Indeed, the UVP testified that he showed two Lieutenants the first memorandum, but no action was taken. Kelly Report of Investigation (ROI), Exh. 12, at 2. We note in this respect that enough tune passed for the first memorandum to have been moved from the Union bulletin board to the board outside of management's offices. It was not until after the second memorandum was posted that the Warden took the action the agency described, namely conducting an informal investigation, placing a lock on the bulletin board, issuing a memorandum to staff about the unprofessional conduct in June 12, and addressing the staff at a meeting regarding the memoranda. After carefully considering the testimony contained in the affidavits, as well as documentary evidence in the record, we find the agency knew about the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action, as a second memorandum with even more racially offensive language was posted on the bulletin board at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent">An environment that is racially hostile can offend employees who are not the target of the hostility. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, &#x00A7; 615.3(a). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Childress v. City of Richmond</span>, 120 F.3d 476 (4th Cir. 1997) (white male police officers state claim by alleging they are offended by environment hostile toward blacks and females), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Childress v. City of Richmond</span>, 134 F.3d 1205 (4th Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the harassment is based on association with a racial group it is within the ambit of Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120063577 (2008), the complainant, a white female, alleged that she was subjected to harassment because she had biracial children and her supervisor believed she dated and liked men who were black.</p>
