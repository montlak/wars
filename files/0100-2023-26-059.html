<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-60"><span class="space">d.</span> Agency Actions Involving an EEO Complaint/Interference With EEO Activity</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Minor v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064925 (2008), the Commission found that the actions of supervisor in rescheduling the complainant's appointment with an EEO counselor without consulting with him was actionable retaliation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Minor</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlawful retaliation for EEO activity can occur whenever the employer acts in response to protected EEO activity in such a way that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity in the future. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998), at 8-13 to 8-14. Even if complainant successfully initiates the EEO process in spite of the interference, complainant is still aggrieved. <span class="Italic">See Marr, supra.</span> In the instant case, we find that complainant's supervisor rescheduled the appointment with the EEO Counselor without asking complainant, did not initially have any information for complainant regarding when the new appointment would be, and told complainant that he would just have to miss his EEO appointment. This behavior was witnessed by several of complainant's coworkers and they provided statements regarding this incident for the record. We find that a supervisor rescheduling a complainant's EEO Counselor meeting without initially discussing the action with complainant is likely to deter future protected activity. Accordingly, we determine that the supervisor unlawfully retaliated against complainant by interfering with his EEO activity. The agency's order is hereby reversed with regard to this claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Buckner v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120103052 (2011), the Commission found that an attempt by an area manager to schedule "town hall meetings" that the complainant was required to attend just prior to her scheduled EEO hearing constituted actionable retaliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant attempts to set out a pattern of retaliatory harassment under a very specific set of circumstances. In her May 27, 2010 letter to the Agency to explain how she was harmed, Complainant alleges that the Area Director previously tried to meet with her on at least four separate occasions under the guise of town hall meetings to talk one-on-one about her pending EEO complaint. And when the Area Director scheduled a new mandatory town hall meeting to take place days before her hearing with an EEOC AJ, Complainant alleges that this was a continuation of a pattern of retaliatory harassment to try to intimidate or dissuade herself and her witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming the allegations are true, we find that Complainant stated a claim of a pattern of retaliatory harassment under the particular circumstances of this case. The specific actions here involve a pattern of an Agency official arranging mandatory town hall meetings in order to meet with Complainant afterwards about a pending EEO complaint, when Complainant did not voluntarily agree to try and resolve the dispute informally. We find that such a pattern of behavior might dissuade a reasonable person in Complainant's position from pursuing a charge of discrimination, particularly when it occurs shortly before an EEOC AJ hearing. Therefore, we determine that the Agency erred in dismissing this claim for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720140023 (2014), the Commission determined that the complainant was not subject to retaliation when some particularly egregious incidents of harassment involving the complainant were used as examples in a presentation to management. Noting that the complainant was not named in the presentation and that examples involving others were also used, the Commission found that the actions did not have a chilling effect:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the AJ properly determined that Complainant failed to establish that the October 2008 PowerPoint training present to ARTCC Denver Center managers constituted discrimination in retaliation for prior protected activity. The record reveals that Person A's role was minor in developing the training. Person A stated that his role was to review old EEO briefings and EEO Orders to help Person D with the slides for the PowerPoint presentation. Person A also stated that he reviewed the final PowerPoint for editing purposes. Person A stated that Person D used the photos and language in the presentation "as a powerful statement that this stuff's got to stop." The record shows that Person D believed not using Complainant's name protected his confidentiality, and she felt managers needed to know the seriousness of some of the actions at the facility. In addition, we note that the PowerPoint training included examples of inappropriate actions taken against other unnamed employees, in addition to the incidents involving Complainant. We find the AJ properly determined the record did not show that Person D or Person A intended to retaliate against Complainant in providing the training. In addition, we note that during the hearing when Complainant was asked whether he thought the PowerPoint training was "intended to be retaliatory," Complainant stated that he "wrestled with that" and stated he termed it "reckless." We do not find the training in this instance would reasonably deter an individual from pursuing the EEO process. Management, even apart from EEO training, could reasonably want to make other management aware of the serious nature of inappropriate actions that had been ongoing in the office.</p>
<p class="noindent">Investigating previous EEO complaints filed by an employee and discussing those complaints with another supervisor is reasonably likely to deter an employee from filing or pursuing a complaint as the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120132365 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claim 5, the Chief testified that he informed Complainant that he previously had concerns about some of the things Complainant had said in his previous EEO complaint. The Chief also testified that he discussed this matter with the superintendent and conducted an inquiry into why Complainant made EEO statements that seemed inconsistent with the Chief s testimony. The AJ questioned the wisdom of the Chiefs admission to Complainant, but nonetheless found that it did not constitute evidence of retaliatory animus. We find that the AJ erred as a matter of law when she reached this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Chief testified that he conducted an inquiry into Complainant's previous EEO activity, as well as discussed his previous EEO activity with another Agency official. We find that, in so doing, the Chief engaged in actions that are reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in EEO activity when he subjected Complainant's EEO statements to management's review and scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120113916 (Jan. 31, 2012) (Commission found reprisal because agency targeted complainant for investigation based on prior EEO activity). EEO complaints should be investigated and adjudicated within the EEO process by designated EEO officials, not by management. Although Complainant's previous EEO complaint had been settled, the Chief revived the matter and impermissibly entangled himself into Complainant's EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082983 (Feb. 16, 2010) (improper entanglement with employees' EEO activity is reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, by informing Complainant about the inquiry into his previous EEO activity, the Chief engaged in additional conduct that could dissuade employees from participating in the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Vincent v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120072908 (Aug. 3, 2009) (comments that discourage an employee from participating in EEO process violate letter and spirit of EEOC regulations and constitute <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the law). In essence, the Chief's conduct has a chilling effect on the EEO process because it sends the message that EEO claims and testimony are vulnerable to subsequent inquiry, discussion, and adverse actions by management officials. Thus, we find that the Chief's inquiry into Complainant's previous EEO activity constitutes reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that management ordered a union representative out of a break room he used to work on EEO complaints for members states an actionable claim of retaliation. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120073621 (2007). The incident, if proven, was reasonably likely to deter others from EEO activity. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120130682 (2014), the Commission found that the complainant, who was representing other employees in EEO complaints, had stated a claim for relief where he alleged that a supervisor refused to sign his official time request because he was busy and refused to permit the complainant to leave the form with him, complainant's own supervisor made him wait 30 minutes before signing the form and made comments about who's time he was on and then threatened him AWOL on his return to his work station.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Conlin v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01200553101 (2006), the Commission found that the supervisor engaged in retaliation when he sent an email to the complainant's coworkers asking whether any of them had a problem with the complainant so he could use that information in defending himself in the EEO complaint she had file that named the supervisor as a responsible management official. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Conlin</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has stated that adverse actions need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. _____, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006) (finding that the anti-retaliation provision protects individuals from a retaliatory action that a reasonable person would have found "materially adverse," which in the retaliation context means that the action might have deterred a reasonable person from opposing discrimination <span id="Page_1509"></span>or participating in the EEOC charge process); <span class="Italic">see also Lindsey v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999) (citing EEOC Compliance Manual, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998)). Instead, the statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Upon review, we find that LPS's e-mail can certainly be defined as inappropriate conduct. Moreover, we find that LPS's e-mail constituted the type of activity that is reasonably likely to deter complainant or others from engaging in protected activity. Therefore, the Commission finds that LPS's action constitutes reprisal discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132974 (2014), the Commission found that including a budget overrun as a result of the complainant's EEO award that generated comments at meeting was an action that could deter a reasonable person from filing or pursuing a complaint. In that case, the complainant, a station manager, was awarded $175,000 in damages and over $50,000 in attorney fees, as well as other equitable relief, as a result of her EEO complaint. The relief resulted in an overrun of her station budget that was highlighted during the meeting. In reversing the agency's decision to dismiss the complaint, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on Complainant's argument on appeal, and a review of her complaint, we find that the Agency did not accurately capture issue 1. Complainant is alleging that she was discriminated against in reprisal for prior EEO activity when she learned on January 31, 2013, that her large EEO award against the Agency was being counted against her in the Total Operating Expenses of her fiscal year 2013 unit annual budget, making her significantly over budget, that her award amount was part of a power point presentation in a public meeting on January 31, 2013, generating comments from some attendees on whether this was her EEO award amount, and she was asked to discuss why she was over budget for this meeting when her EEO award was the cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its FAD, the Agency found that Complainant's concern that being asked to explain why she was over budget may result in her prior EEO award being discussed was speculative. According to the counselor's report, the involved manager asserted after an objection from Complainant that he advised her she did not have to discuss her EEO award, but conceded that the expenditure at issue involved grievance payouts, which Complainant contends refers to her EEO award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's actions in issue 1, as redefined here, would reasonably likely deter EEO activity. Accordingly, the Agency's dismissal of issue 1 is reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Requiring an employee to meet with a psychologist for "training" to facilitate a "better work environment" only after the complainant filed her EEO complaint is reasonably likely to deter an individual from filing or pursuing a complaint. In <span class="Italic">Maryanne S. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720140028 (2015), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we concur with the AJ and Complainant's attorney that this matter was reasonably likely to deter Complainant or others from engaging in protected activity. The Chief Psychologist (P1) testified that he had not conducted this type of employee "training" before and that his duties entailed counseling the inmate population at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">P1 was reporting information from these straining" sessions to management. For example, in one memorandum to the Warden, P1, after a training" session with Complainant, made the following comments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A training session occurred with [Complainant] to continue the process of assisting her overcome personal issues that have contributed to interpersonal conflict within her department...we discussed [Complainant's] limited ability to move beyond issues that do not warrant excessive rumination, blame, and anger. She continues to have a difficult time adapting and accepting environmental changes. Moreover, she continues to place blame and magnify issues that do not warrant her typical response and investment or resources.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the same memorandum to the Warden, P1 also addressed Complainant's "Interpersonal Disposition<span class="Italic">."</span> Specifically, P1 stated "[Complainant] had a difficult time focusing on necessary objectives due to her pre-occupation with other issues. Furthermore, her insight appears to be somewhat limited by ingrained thought that will be difficult to alter. This may interfere with the process of insight and change."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency asserts that management had both Complainant and S1 attend these individual sessions with P1 in an effort to facilitate a better working environment in the Financial Management Department, we find that there is substantial evidence in the record to establish pretext for retaliation. We concur with the AJ that "[a]lthough on the surface the this Workplace Improvement Plan may have been well intended, it gives the impression that if an employee, such as Complainant, complains about mistreatment by a management official, that they could [potentially] face psychological training by their employer. Furthermore, mandated 'training' of this nature could [potentially] have a 'chilling effect' on employees seeking to pursue claims of discrimination and/or harassment..."</p>
<p class="noindent">Even the agency's proposal that the complainant submit to a fitness examination based on information the complainant provided in a prior EEO complaint constituted reprisal in <span class="Italic">Elbert H. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120170676 (2018). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Elbert H</span>. provided medical information in a pleading related to his disability discrimination claim. Based on that information, the agency sent him correspondence requesting the name of his treating physician, asking him to sign a medical release, and proposing a fitness-for-duty examination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Elbert H</span>. had little trouble finding reprisal, especially given that agency counsel directed the agency to make the requests:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant engaged in protected activity when he filed his prior EEO complaint. His pleading in response to the Agency's motion was part of his protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency subjected Complainant to a materially adverse action when it sent him correspondence requesting the name of his treating physician, asking him to sign a medical release, and proposing to conduct a fitness-for-duty inquiry or examination. Such correspondence is reasonably likely to deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity and has a potentially chilling effect on the EEO process. Even though the Agency ultimately did not send Complainant for a medical examination, it let Complainant believe for almost four months that it intended to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that there is a direct causal connection between Complainant's protected EEO activity and the materially adverse action. The Agency expressly relied on statements that Complainant made in his pleading before the EEOC AJ as a basis for asserting that it needed to contact his physician to determine his fitness for duty. The Agency continued to pursue this action even after Complainant pointed out that he had been working on fully duty for nearly three years. It was not until the National Employee Health Coordinator became involved in the matter that the Agency retreated from its efforts. Even then, as Complainant noted, the Agency waited four weeks before notifying him that it was no longer pursuing a fitness-for-duty examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, it is clear that Attorney 1--the individual representing the Agency against Complainant in the matter involving his prior EEO complaint--directed the Agency's actions in this matter. Attorney 1 did not merely contact the HR Manager or the National Employee Health Coordinator about any ostensible concerns he had regarding Complainant's ability to perform his job. Instead, Attorney 1 contacted the HR Manager, twice instructed her to issue an "8-point letter" to Complainant, and told her to order a fitness-for-duty examination. It was more than "ill advised" for Attorney 1 and the HR Manager to proceed in this manner. It was <span class="Italic">per se</span> reprisal. There simply is no place in the EEO process for such conduct. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. EEO MD-110 at IV. ("conflicts of interest can arise when agency representatives in offices, programs, or divisions within the agency with a legal defensive role play a part in the impartial processing").</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a complainant alleged that she received a counseling memorandum for seeing an EEO counselor without prior approval from her chain-of-command, this stated an actionable claim of retaliation. In <span class="Italic">Dupuich v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120073692 (2007), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also notes that complainant raised the issue of reprisal in her April 8, 2007 letter alleging breach in that she was counseled for seeing an EEO counselor in March 2007. The record contains a copy of a memorandum which indicates that complainant was counseled for being at the EEO office and states she is required to notify and get approval from the "chain of command" for visits to the EEO office. In <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999) (citing EEOC Compliance Manual, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998)) the Commission determined that the statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. The Commission has concerns as to whether the agency's act of requiring complainant to notify and receive approval through the chain of command before going to the EEO office is appropriate and if it is likely to deter employees from engaging in EEO activity. Thus, the agency is directed to process the complainant's claim regarding the counseling memorandum and include the issue of having to notify and get approval from the chain of command before going to the EEO office.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">St. John v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120073483 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim of retaliation when he alleged that he was subjected to an interview by a Postal Inspector based on an accusation that he had threatened a manager while testifying in an EEO complaint. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">St. John</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, we find that, under the circumstances of this case, subjecting an employee to an interview by a Postal Inspector on an accusation of making threats about a supervisor arising out of testimony at an EEO hearing is sufficient to state a viable claim of retaliation that needs further investigation before a decision can be made on the merits of the claim. We take note of this particular agency's clear no-tolerance policy for threats of violence, a policy that has been well-communicated <span id="Page_1510"></span>to its employees. Therefore, an accusation of making threats about a supervisor during testimony at an EEO hearing, accompanied by an interview from an agency law enforcement official, would be perceived by agency employees as a very serious event, and could be sufficient to dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in further EEO activity. As such, these circumstances are sufficient to state a claim of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Instructing an employee to let her supervisors know if she decides to file an EEO complaint is conduct reasonably likely to deter a complainant from filing or pursuing a complaint. In <span class="Italic">Vanegas v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 0120083421 (2011), the complainant told a supervisor that she was considering filing a complaint over her recent performance appraisal. The supervisor asked if she meant an EEO complaint or a complaint with the Human Resources Department. He then told the complainant that she should let him and her immediate supervisor know if she meant an EEO complaint. Although the supervisor maintained that he did not intend to discourage the complainant from filing a complaint, the Commission found that conduct was reasonably likely to have that effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">Requiring subordinate employees to go to their supervisor prior to filing and EEO complainant and more closely monitoring an employee after a complaint is filed are also actions that would deter a reasonable person from filing or pursuing a complaint. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Coronado v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120122196 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the record reveals that on August 10, 2010, Supervisor 1 was contacted via electronic mail by the EEO Counselor and informed that the EEO Counselor would be meeting with Complainant on August 11, 2010. Substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that on August 11 and 12, 2010, Supervisor 1 told his subordinates that those who file EEO complaints or union grievances without coming to him first were "not men and had no integrity" and that they must go through him before going to the EEO Office. We agree with the AJ that while Supervisor 1 had a need to know, for purposes of scheduling work, if an employee was going to the EEO Office during duty hours, he did not need to know the reason for the employee going to the EEO Office. In the present case, we find that the comments made by Supervisor 1 would deter a reasonable person from opposing discrimination or participating in the EEO process. Given the close proximity, at most a day or two, between the notice from the EEO Counselor that Complainant had an EEO appointment and the statements made by Supervisor 1, we find a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. Moreover, we determine that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that Supervisor 1 made these comments in an effort to discourage the filing of EEO complaints and thus, had a retaliatory motive for making these comments. As part of the remedy we shall order the Agency to inform the employees in Complainant's office that they do not need to inform supervisors of their reasons for visiting the EEO office or even get permission to visit the EEO office unless they need to do so for scheduling reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to issue (2)(f), Complainant alleged that following his June 24, 2010 initial contact with an EEO Counselor, to the present, Supervisor 1 checked on him twice a day. We find that the record supports the AJ's finding that Supervisor 1 was notified of Complainant's EEO Counselor contact shortly after Complainant contacted the counselor. We note that on appeal, the Agency does not challenge this finding by the AJ. The record reveals that the Administrative Assistant corroborated Complainant's allegation that Supervisor 1 checked on Complainant more frequently after he filed his EEO complaint and testified that she believed that after Complainant filed his EEO complaint, he was subjected to more scrutiny by Supervisor 1. Despite the Agency's argument to the contrary, we find that being checked on twice a day by a supervisor and being subjected to increased scrutiny by a supervisor on a continuing basis is reasonably likely to deter a reasonable person from engaging in protected EEO activity. We find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that Supervisor 1 was irritated that Complainant filed the EEO complaint and that more likely than not, for that reason, he frequently checked up on Complainant. Thus, we find that the incident in claim 2(f) was motivated by retaliation for Complainant's prior protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Apparently under the heading of "lawyers behaving badly," the Commission found the conduct of an agency lawyer during a sexual harassment investigation was actionable retaliation. In <span class="Italic">Santa v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080868 (2008), the complainant gave an affidavit as a witness in a sexual harassment investigation that was supportive of the claims. A few months later, the complainant was interviewed by an agency lawyer about his affidavit and when the complainant denied helping the female coworker with her EEO complaint, the lawyer angrily threatened that he would tell the complainant's supervisor he was not cooperating and would take his deposition. As the complainant was leaving the room, he offered to shake hands with the agency lawyer, who refused "because you are an asshole." The Commission had little difficulty determining that the complaint stated a claim for relief. However, on remand on the merits in <span class="Italic">Santa v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090113 (2010), the complainant requested a hearing but then withdrew that request and the Postal Service issued a FAD finding no retaliation. The Commission agreed finding that counsel was not motivated by an intent to retaliate, but instead by a desire to encourage the complainant to cooperate in the EEO process. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Santa</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has a significant interest in ensuring that its managers cooperate in the EEO process as part of their job duties and that Complainant properly construed the attorney's remarks as an indication the attorney would take the steps necessary to subject Complainant to discipline as a result of Complainant's failure to cooperate. We find that the unprofessional remark, accompanied by the specter of discipline, was intended to inform Complainant of the consequence of his failure to cooperate in the investigation of another EEO complaint, rather than to deter or punish him for his prior EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Added to the list of "really bad ideas," is <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120083298 (2008), where the complainant's supervisor asked a coworker to attempt to talk the complainant into withdrawing her complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that the supervisor asked complainant's co-worker to use her influence to convince complainant to drop her EEO complaint, and also stated to the co-worker that he wanted complainant to drop the complaint because he did not want anyone to get in trouble or lose their job. The agency stated that the supervisor's mere request that the co-worker use her influence to convince complainant to drop the complaint was not retaliation. We disagree. The supervisor's request is reasonably likely to deter an individual from pursuing the EEO process. Additionally, the record establishes that a few months later that same supervisor told complainant that he did not think she should have filed an EEO complaint. We find that this is also reasonably likely to deter complainant from pursuing the EEO process. Therefore, complainant has established that retaliation existed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, the Commission found there was a potential chilling effect in <span class="Italic">Krinke v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985696 (1999), and that the complainant had stated a claim for relief where he alleged that one postmaster showed another postmaster his EEO complaint files. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Krinke</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, PM1's disclosure of appellant's EEO files to PM2 does not encourage "the realization of equal employment opportunity in the workforce, and could have a potentially chilling effect on the ultimate tool that employees have to enforce equal employment opportunity-the filing of an EEO complaint." <span class="Italic">George v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980451 (October 8, 1998)<span class="Italic">. See also Torrez v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC 05950947 (March 10, 1998). No explanation is given in the record for why PM1 disclosed appellant's EEO file to PM2, nor is there any evidence which would indicate that PM2 had a need to see appellant's EEO file. We find that such action could easily be used to attempt to intimidate an employee from utilizing the EEO complaint process or proceeding with his or her complaint. Therefore, the Commission remands allegation (2) for investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Mangan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01981752 (1999), the Commission found that interviewing the complainant's subordinate for a position would not have a chilling effect on that subordinate's testimony at the complainant's EEO hearing. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Detar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02085 (2001), the Commission found that several minor incidents, including one where the complainant's supervisor told employees they would have to eat a cake brought in by a coworker during their break because someone filed an EEO complaint, "could not be construed as demonstrating an intent to deter a reasonable person from pursuing the EEO process."</p>
