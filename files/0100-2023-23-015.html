<h2 class="h2" id="sec14-16"><span class="space">II.</span> DEFINING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS</h2>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the most significant provisions of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, including the provisions prohibiting discrimination and the reasonable accommodation requirement, applied only to qualified individuals with disabilities. The ADAAA has revised the language to be simply a "qualified individual," however, it has not changed the fact that two separate determinations must be made on whether the Rehabilitation Act applies in these situations. First, it must be determined if the employee or applicant for employment is a person with a disability. That determination alone does not trigger the requirements of the Act. Under 42 USC 12111(8), it must further be determined that the individual is "qualified," as defined by the Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this title, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing <span id="Page_1104"></span>applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent">The definition of disability was not included in the original legislation or in subsequent amendments until the ADAAA of 2008. The ADAAA, at 42 USC 12102)1, now specifically defines disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term 'disability' means, with respect to an individual--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;a record of such an impairment; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the ADAAA, at 42 USC 12102(2), Congress expanded upon the Commission's regulatory definitions of major life activities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;IN GENERAL--For purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;MAJOR BODILY FUNCTIONS--For purposes of paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the sections that follow, this definition is dissected into its primary components. However, the reader is provided with a note of caution at the outset. The term "disability" is used in several statutes other than the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. In each case, the term has a different definition that is specifically set forth in the Statute in question or in regulations promulgated under the Statute. A disability under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act is not the same as a disability under veterans preference legislation or under the Social Security Act or under the disability retirement provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act. Neither is it the same as a disability under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA. Moreover, the term "disability" is one that finds a large degree of usage in the English language generally where it is not susceptible to precise definition. As used in the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, "disability" is a term of art. The reader who fails to constantly bear that fact in mind runs a significant risk of misunderstanding both the spirit and the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Aside from obvious disabilities where an individual cannot perform a major life activity such as seeing or hearing, there is no bright-line rule for determining coverage under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. The ADAAA contains a provision to the effect that the definition of a disability "shall be construed in favor of broad coverage...to the maximum extent permitted by" the Act. 42 USC 12102(4)(A). But as a general rule whether any particular medical condition constitutes a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity is a question of fact. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01920648 (1992), the Commission explained that such questions must be resolved on a case-by-case basis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[F]ederal courts and the Commission have stressed that the question of who is a person with a disability under the Act is "best suited to a 'case-by-case' determination." <span class="Italic">Forrisi v. Bowen</span>, 794 F.2d 931 (4th Cir. 1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">E.E. Black, Ltd. v. Marshall</span>, 497 F. Supp. 1088, 1100 (D. Hawaii 1980)). Further, the statutory and regulatory language, requiring a "substantial" limitation of a "major" life activity, emphasizes that the underlying impairment in a discrimination case based on a disability must be a significant one. As one court observed, "It was open to Congress to omit these limiting adjectives, but Congress did not do so." <span class="Italic">Tudyman v. United Airlines</span>, 608 F. Supp. 739, 745 (C.D. Cal. 1984). Accord <span class="Italic">Forrisi</span>, 794 F.2d at 732.</p>

<p class="noindent">In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking implementing the ADAAA, the Commission included several impairments that it said would "consistently meet" the criteria of substantially limiting a major life activity. The Commission proposed regulations, at 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(5), provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examples of Impairments that Will Consistently Meet the Definition of Disability--(i) Interpreting the definition of disability broadly and without extensive analysis as required under the ADA Amendments Act, some types of impairments will consistently meet the definition of disability. Because of certain characteristics associated with these impairments, the individualized assessment of the limitations on a person can be conducted quickly and easily, and will consistently result in a determination that the person is substantially limited in a major life activity. In addition to examples such as deafness, blindness, intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation), partially or completely missing limbs, and mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair, other examples of impairments that will consistently meet the definition include, but are not limited to--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;Autism, which substantially limits major life activities such as communicating, interacting with others, or learning;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;Cancer, which substantially limits major life activities such as normal cell growth;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;Cerebral palsy, which substantially limits major life activities such as walking, performing manual tasks, speaking, or functions of the brain;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;Diabetes, which substantially limits major life activities such as functions of the endocrine system (e.g., the production of insulin, <span class="Italic">see</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 17);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(E)&#x2003;Epilepsy, which substantially limits major life activities such as functions of the brain or, during a seizure, seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, or thinking;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(F)&#x2003;HIV or AIDS, which substantially limit functions of the immune system;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(G)&#x2003;Multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy, which substantially limit major life activities including neurological functions, walking, performing manual tasks, seeing, speaking, or thinking;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(H)&#x2003;Major depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or schizophrenia, which substantially limit major life activities including functions of the brain, thinking, concentrating, interacting with others, sleeping, or caring for oneself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(ii)&#x2003;No Negative Implication From Omission of Particular Major Life Activities. An individual with one of the impairments listed in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section may be substantially limited in one or more of the major life activities identified, and/or may be substantially limited in other major life activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(iii)&#x2003;No Negative Implication From Omission of Particular Impairments. The list of examples in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section is merely intended to illustrate some of the types of impairments that are consistently substantially limiting. Other types of impairments not specifically identified in the examples included in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section may also consistently be substantially limiting, such as some forms of depression other than major depression and seizure disorders other than epilepsy.</p>
<p class="noindent">74 FR 48440 (Sept. 23, 2009). The NPRM also contained a section delineating conditions that usually would not meet the definition of a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its Notice of Final Rulemaking, the Commission deleted those provisions explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, NPRM &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(6), describing certain impairments that may or may not meet the definition of "substantially limits," and NPRM &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(8), describing certain impairments that usually will not meet the definition of "substantially limits," have been deleted in favor of an affirmative statement in both the final regulations and the appendix that not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of &#x00A7; 1630.2(j) (defining "substantially limits").</p>
<p class="noindent">76 FR 16981 (March 25, 2011). In its place, however, the Commission has delineated several impairments that, when individually analyzed, will result in a "predictable assessment" of being substantially limiting. The "predictable assessment" regulations is discussed below in the section on Rules of Construction.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the ADA covers individuals who have a disability, it does not extend coverage to individuals who have a medical condition that does not rise to the level of a disability, except as provided for under the third prong or regarded as definition of a disability. An allegation that an appellant was not hired because he was not severely disabled enough to qualify for consideration under a handicapped program fails to state a claim of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Reese v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951667 (1997), the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his complaint form appellant indicated that he was discriminated against because of disability. Appellant described his disability as "not hearing impaired enough." The record clearly shows that appellant is alleging that he was not hired for a career position in the handicapped program because he was not sufficiently disabled. The Commission finds that this claim is not the same as a claim that he was not hired because of his disability. Instead, appellant is alleging that he was discriminated against because of a lack of a severe disability. Appellant has not alleged that he was discriminated against because of his hearing impairment. Lack of a severe disability is not a basis of discrimination under EEOC Regulations or the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">That an individual has a disability under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA requires three separate determinations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1)&#x2003;That the individual has a physical or mental impairment, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2)&#x2003;That the impairment affects one or more major life activities; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3)&#x2003;That the major life activity or activities are substantially limited as a result of the impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1105"></span>The latter two determinations, in particular, are intertwined. An impairment does not rise to the level of a disability unless it substantially limits a major life activity. Yet, it helps to keep in mind that the determination of whether the function or functions affected by an impairment constitute a major life activity and the determination of whether any such effect is a substantial limitation are separate. It is entirely possible for an impairment to affect a major life activity but not be a substantial limitation on that activity. Prior to January 1, 2009, the Commission's regulations, consistent with Supreme Court holdings, required that in order to be substantially limited in a major life activity, an individual must be unable to perform that activity, or be significantly restricted as to the manner, duration, or conditions under which an average person in the general population can perform the activity. 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1). In the uncodified Findings and Purposes section, the ADAAA has eliminated the requirement that to be "substantially limited" an individual must be "significantly" or "severely" restricted in performing a major life activity to be an individual with a disability. Sec. 2(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has eliminated the "significantly" or "severely" restricted language from its final regulations at Part 1630.</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, the basic formulation of determining whether a complainant is a qualified individual with a disability remains as set forth by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Bragdon v. Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624, 631 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we consider whether respondent's [condition] was a physical [or mental] impairment. Second, we identify the life activity on which respondent relies...and determine whether it constitutes a life activity under the ADA. Third, tying the two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited a major life activity...Once it has been determined that an individual has a disability, a further determination must be made as to whether that individual is "qualified." There are two criteria for determining whether someone is a qualified individual with a disability. Under 29 CFR 1630.2(m), he or she must:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1)&#x2003;Meet the basic requirements of the position he or she holds or desires; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2)&#x2003;Be able to perform the essential functions of that position, with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to a detailed discussion of each of these criteria, two observations are in order. First, the issue of whether an employee is entitled to reasonable accommodation involves a bit of circular logic, namely, the employee is entitled to reasonable accommodation if he or she is an individual with a disability who is qualified. But whether the individual is qualified requires consideration of reasonable accommodation, unless the individual can perform the essential functions of the position without reasonable accommodation. To the degree that the definition of an individual with a disability who is qualified and the entitlement to reasonable accommodation are circular concepts, this is a function of the way Congress drafted the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. All that Congress was really trying to do, however, was to say that an individual with a disability who could not perform the essential functions of the position in question even with reasonable accommodation is not entitled to any accommodation. Whether there was a better way to express that intent is a purely academic matter. The second observation is that, because the determination of whether a particular individual with a disability is qualified requires consideration of the specific position that individual holds or desires, it is entirely possible, if not likely, that the same individual could be an individual with a disability who is qualified with regard to one position but not a different position. This latter observation simply underscores the need for a case-by-case determination of whether an individual with a disability is qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">With that introduction, the separate components of the determination of whether someone is an individual with a disability who is qualified are discussed below.</p>
