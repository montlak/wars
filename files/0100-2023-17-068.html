<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-69"><span class="space">6.</span> Failure to Produce File on Appeal</h4>
<p class="noindent">The agency is responsible for producing a complaint file for the Office of Federal Operations once an appeal is filed. Failure to produce the file in response to orders from OFO can result in sanctions. In <span class="Italic">Klimek v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720120026 (2013), the Commission sanctioned the agency by dismissing its appeal and upholding the finding of discrimination by the administrative judge where it did not produce the complaint file with its appeal and did not respond to orders of OFO to produce the complaint file. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0120113765 (2014) (imposing default judgment for failure to produce file); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 0120110117 (2014) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120114192 (2014), the agency's failure to produce the complete hearing record on appeal where the administrative judge had granted summary judgment resulted in a sanction of remand for hearing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Notice, the Agency provided OFO with what it stated was the complete record. However, a review of the record provided by the Agency revealed that it failed to do so. Specifically, the complete hearing record was not provided by the Agency. Significantly, the Agency failed to provide its own Motion for Summary Judgment and Complainant's response which were referred to within the AJ's decision. We find that the Agency's failure to submit the complete record makes it impossible for us to determine whether the AJ appropriately issued a decision without a hearing in the Agency's favor. Based on the Agency's repeated failure to submit the complete record, the imposition of sanctions is warranted. <span class="Italic">Vu v. Social Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120072632 (Jan. 20, 2011) (sanctions appropriate where Agency failed to provide this Commission with motions and responses in support and opposition to decision without a hearing). The Agency was on notice that sanctions were possible if the Agency failed to submit the complete record. The Agency failed to submit the documentation requested and, consequently, a decision cannot be rendered on this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sanctions serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, they aim to deter the underlying conduct of the non-complying party and prevent similar misconduct in the future. <span class="Italic">Barbour v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC 07A30133 (June 16, 2005). On the other hand, they are corrective and provide equitable remedies to the opposing party. Given these dual purposes, sanctions must be tailored to each situation by applying the least severe sanction necessary to respond to a party's failure to show good cause for its actions and to equitably remedy the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (Sept. 25. 2009). Several factors are considered in "tailoring" a sanction and determining if a particular sanction is warranted: 1) the extent and nature of the non-compliance, and the justification presented by the noncomplying party; 2) the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; 3) the consequences resulting from the delay in justice; and 4) the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (Mar. 1, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, we find that the Agency failed to comply with OFO's request to submit the entire record. We are unable to determine whether the AJ properly issued a decision without a hearing due to the incomplete record. Based on the foregoing, we find that the most appropriate sanction is to remand this matter for a hearing before an AJ. <span class="Italic">See Vu v. Social Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120072632 (Jan. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Shehata v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102315 (May 9, 2012). As such, we remand claims (2) and (3) for a hearing and note that claim (1) should be considered as evidence towards Complainant's claim of a discriminatory non-selection.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_599"></span>However, in a decision that is confusing because it grants default judgment, but then refers to adverse inference, the Commission issued findings of discrimination based on age and religion when the agency failed to produce the complaint file one appeal after the administrative judge had issued summary judgment in favor of the agency. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120083446 (2015), the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the record before us is not the same record presented to the AJ. The record submitted by the Agency is missing the complete report of investigation, affidavits from the witnesses, the "fact-finding conference" documentation, including the testimony of all of the witnesses, resumes and applications of all of the applicants for this position, interview notes, all of the motions, pleadings, and correspondence generated during the hearing process, motions to amend the complaint, discovery materials, hearing exhibits, and the transcript of the hearing that was held on May 29, 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the conduct of the Agency in this case and its failure to show good cause for why sanctions should not be imposed, we find that the imposition of sanctions is warranted. The Commission repeatedly requested the complete complaint file and hearing file from the Agency. The Agency was on notice that sanctions were possible if the Agency failed to comply. The Agency failed to submit the documentation requested and, consequently, significantly delayed our ability to issue a decision in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Vu v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072632 (Jan.20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Chattopadhyay v. Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081177 (Sept. 28, 2012); <span class="Italic">Chattopadhyay v. Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091142 (Sept. 28, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. <span class="Italic">Vu, supra</span>. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, it may be an abuse of discretion to impose a harsher sanction. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (Mar. 1, 2007); <span class="Italic">Hale v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (Dec. 8, 2000). Factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is, in fact, warranted, would necessarily include the extent and nature of the non-compliance, to include the justification presented by the non-complying party; the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; and, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record before us, we find that the AJ's determinations of fact and credibility determinations are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. There are no documents in the record supplied to us to support the AJ's conclusions. Additionally, many of the AJ's findings of fact are vague and she refers generally to the report of investigation, the interview notes, the affidavits, documents from the fact-finding conference, or the hearing transcript. Since we cannot refer to any of those documents, we cannot find that the AJ's conclusions and her ultimate decision are supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, we issue a default judgment in favor of Complainant. We note that this default judgment is supported by the record that was supplied to us. For example, Complainant alleged in his formal complaint that the selecting official in this complaint continuously told Complainant every time he applied for a promotion that "war is a young man's game" and that he wanted young men for any open supervisory positions. Complainant alleged that these statements were made in front of witnesses, and that he could produce three witnesses who would attest to hearing these statements. The Agency did not provide us with witness affidavits, and it is unclear from the record why the AJ denied all of Complainant's witnesses and allowed only Agency witnesses to testify at the hearing. We also do not have the hearing transcript to review the selecting official's explanation of those statements. Drawing an adverse inference that these documents would have revealed that discriminatory animus existed related to Complainant's age, we find that Complainant established that he was discriminated against on the basis of age when he was not selected for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the record supplied to us supports a finding of religious discrimination. On the formal complaint form signed by Complainant and dated December 21, 2005, Complainant wrote "Quaker" next to the religion box; however, there is no indication in the Agency's February 1, 2006, Notice of Acceptance why the Agency did not process Complainant's claim of religious discrimination. It does not appear that Complainant abandoned this claim, as the record contains a letter dated March 10, 2007, from Complainant to the Agency's EEO Office in which he alleged that the Agency had considered religion in the selection decision. There is no indication in the record before us that the Agency made any efforts to amend this complaint in conformance with EEOC regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(d). <span class="Italic">See Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100403 (Feb. 27, 2012) (where complainant mentioned in documents to agency that she believed age was a basis of discrimination, agency erred when it did not amend complaint while complaint was pending). Based on the record before us. we find that the Agency erred when it did not amend the complaint to include religion as a basis of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is evidence in the record before us that supports Complainant's allegation that his religion played a role in the non-selection. Specifically, Complainant alleged that one of the selecting officials provided all of the other selecting officials with Complainant's religious information and related purported conscientious objector status1 during the selection process. This allegation is supported by information in the EEO Counselor's Report. The EEO Counselor stated that Complainant's Commander, a Lieutenant Colonel and one of the selecting officials for the position at issue, told the EEO Counselor that Complainant "was not the best choice. . .because he is a conscientious objector." EEO Counselor's Report at 4. Because we do not have the hearing transcript. we cannot know whether this allegation was addressed during the hearing. We also do not have affidavits or interview notes from the selecting officials to determine whether they referred to Complainant's religion or purported conscientious objector status as a reason for his non-selection. Drawing an adverse inference that these documents would have revealed discriminatory animus existed related to Complainant's religion, we find that Complainant established that his religion was taken into consideration when the Agency did not select him for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision that is considerably less confusing, the Commission rejected the complainant's request for default judgment as a sanction and instead imposed an adverse inference that a complete record would have established that the agency's legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for not selecting him for a GS-13 position was pretextual. The Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Gerald L. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120123187 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Agency produced the hearing transcript for the first time in response to the 2014 Show Cause Order (i.e., more than two years late) and despite assertions to the contrary has never produced the ROI. We also find the Agency's response to the SCO2 disingenuous. Even assuming it believed that it had submitted the AJ's hearing files in 2012, OFO provided the Agency with written and verbal notice of document deficiencies throughout the two years without any response. Only after the Agency received the SCO2 did it provide the actual hearing transcripts. However, despite its contrary assertions, we have not received the ROI. Given such inexplicable failings, along with this Agency's history of similar noncompliance issues, we find that the appropriate sanction for the Agency's non-compliance with the Commission's Part 1614 Regulation is to issue a decision partially in favor of Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the Commission notes that of all the non-selections at issue, the partial record contains the most available documentary evidence as to the selection process as to GS-13 Deputy Regional Administrator (DRA) position in Vancouver, Washington. The Commission finds that a complete ROI would show that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal as to the Agency's failure to select him for this DRA position on or about October 25, 2004. The available documentary evidence in the record establishes that on October 25, 2004, Complainant was deemed qualified and referred for the DRA position under the FRA's Affirmative Action Plan for the Hiring, Advancement and Placement of Individuals with Disabilities. Further, the record also establishes that the alleged responsible management official (RMO) was involved in the selection of DRA positions and was aware of Complainant's prior EEO activity at the time of this referral. However, Complainant was not selected for the position. As a result, the Commission finds that a complete ROI would have shown that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal as to that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sanctioning the Agency, the Commission shall draw the adverse inference that a complete ROI would show that the Agency's articulated non-retaliatory reasons for not selecting Complainant were false and pretext for reprisal. We therefore conclude that the Agency has not met its burden of production in response to Complainant's showing of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. We consequently find that Complainant is entitled to a finding of reprisal discrimination as to the Agency's failure to select him for the GS-13 DRA position in Vancouver, Washington.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the Commission affirms the AJ's decision as to the numerous other vacancies. While the record is devoid of documentation related to the selection and referral process (including but not limited to comparison employee information) with respect to these vacancies, substantial record evidence supports the AJ's findings of fact, and the Commission discerns no basis to disturb his conclusions of law.</p>
