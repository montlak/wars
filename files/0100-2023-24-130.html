<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-110"><span class="space">4.</span> Search for a Vacant, Funded Positions</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency's search obligation with respect to reassignments "is not limited to vacancies within a particular department, facility, or geographical area." <span class="Italic">Victor S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120160739 (2017). Rather, the extent of the agency's search for a vacant position is a question of undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Absent a showing of undue hardship, an agency is obligated to conduct an agency-wide search for vacant, funded positions that the employee can perform with or without accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Bill A. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120182340 (2020), provides a good example with a fulsome analysis. The complainant, a mail handler, requested a reasonable accommodation for his lifting restriction. The District Reasonable Accommodation Committee denied his request, concluding that his restrictions prevented him from performing the essential functions of his position. The complainant's requests for light-duty assignments were similarly denied. The Commission found that the agency's search for an "eight-hour position within Complainant's bid assignment" was too narrow:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Commission's regulations, a federal agency may not discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability and is required to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the Agency can show that reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o), (p). The agency may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. An "effective" accommodation either removes a workplace barrier, thereby providing an individual with an equal opportunity to apply for a position, to perform the essential functions of a position, or to gain equal access to a benefit or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) (Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that he was denied a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must show that: (1) he is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) he is a "qualified" individual with a disability pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the Agency failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation. An individual with a disability<span id="Page_1377"></span> is "qualified" if he satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position that the individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). "Essential functions" are the fundamental job duties of the employment position that the individual holds or desires. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first determine if Complainant established he is an individual with a disability covered by the Rehabilitation Act. The record indicates that Complainant has intervertebral disc syndrome and degenerative disc disorder. Due to his medical condition, he is limited to lifting no more than 10 pounds, and no standing or walking for more than 2 hours. He also cannot operate a car, truck, crane, tractor, or other type of motor vehicle. Finally, he stated that he can do no bending, squatting, kneeling, and twisting. We find that Complainant is an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act because he is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Higgins v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A300S6 (Sept. 14, 2005) (finding complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting where he was restricted to lifting no more than 20 pounds); <span class="Italic">see also Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013) (finding complainant is individual with a disability where she was substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting and restricted to lifting no more than 10 pounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A request for a modification or change at work because of a medical condition is a request for reasonable accommodation. Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation at Q. 1. After receiving a request for reasonable accommodation, an agency "must make a reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation." 29 C.F.R. pt. 1614. app. &#x00A7; 1630.9. Thus, "it may be necessary for the [agency] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability...[to] identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.9; Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation at Q. 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable accommodation includes such modifications or adjustments as job restructuring, the acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, and reassignment to a vacant position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). In general, reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and should be considered only when: (1) there are no effective accommodations that would enable an employee to perform the essential functions of his or her current position; or (2) accommodating the employee in the current position would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation, "Reassignment." An agency should reassign the employee to a vacant position that is equivalent in terms of pay, status, and other related factors; if there are no vacant equivalent positions, then the agency should reassign the employee to a lower-level position that is closest to the current position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency, however, may not use reassignment "to limit, segregate, or otherwise discriminate against employees with disabilities by forcing reassignments to undesirable positions or to designated offices or facilities." 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Workers, Compensation and the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Sept. 1996), at Q. 21 (employer may not unilaterally reassign an employee with a disability-related occupational injury to a different position without first assessing whether the employee can perform the essential functions of his or her current position with or without reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency is in the best position to know which jobs are vacant or will become vacant within a reasonable time and, as part of the interactive process, should ask the employee about his qualifications and interests. <span class="Italic">Bill A. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131989 (Oct. 26, 2016). Because it possesses the relevant information, an agency is obligated to inform an employee about vacant positions for which the employee may be eligible as a reassignment. <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Runyon</span>, 132 F.3d 1330, 1344 (10th Cir. 1997) (federal employers are far better placed than employees to investigate in good faith the availability of vacant positions); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation at Q. 28. The employee should assist the agency in identifying vacancies to the extent that the employee has information about them. Further, if the agency is unsure whether the employee is qualified for a particular position, the agency can discuss with the employee his or her qualifications. <span class="Italic">Mengine v. Runyon</span>, 114 F.3d 415, 419-20 (3d Cir. 1997) (once an employer has identified possible vacancies, an employee has a duty to identify which one he is capable of performing)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation at Q. 28.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that a federal agency's obligation under the Rehabilitation Act to offer reassignment is not limited to vacancies within a particular department, facility, or geographical area. Instead, the extent of the agency's search for a vacant position is an issue of undue hardship. Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation at Q. 27. Accordingly, absent undue hardship, the agency must conduct an agency-wide search for vacant, funded positions that the employee can perform with or without reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Julius C. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151295 (June 16, 2017).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant indicated that he is limited to walking or standing for no longer than two hours with an assistive device. Complainant indicated that he submitted a letter to the Postmaster requesting a reasonable accommodation on May 15, 2017. On August 8, 2017, Complainant appeared before the DRAC and provided the Committee with his request for reasonable accommodation and attachments from his physician. On November 21, 2017, M2 informed Complainant that the DRAC had denied his request for reasonable accommodation because his restrictions prevented him from performing the essential functions of his position. Complainant believed that there were functions within his bid assignment that he could accomplish. Furthermore, Complainant averred that "there are hundreds of different positions [at the Agency]; I have to believe there are other positions" to which he could have been reassigned. M2 averred that there is no eight-hour position within Complainant's bid assignment that would allow him to perform within his restrictions. There is no indication that the Agency took any further steps regarding Complainant's request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to claims 9, 10, and 12, the record showed that the Agency continued to deny Complainant a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation. The record indicated that the Manager informed Complainant during the DRAC meeting in April 2018 that there was no work available in the Mail Hander position. We note that Complainant asserted that there were duties he could perform. The Manager chose not to consider Complainant's claims, finding that those duties were performed by Clerks. As such, his request for a reassignment, as alleged in claim 10, was denied. Further, Complainant was subjected to investigative interviews regarding his attendance issues by S1, as alleged in claim 9. Finally, in claim 12, Complainant was issued a letter dated December 17, 2018, stating that because the Agency could not locate a vacant funded position, he would have three options including disability retirement, administrative separation, or obtain another position through eReassign.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that because of his restrictions, Complainant was not qualified to perform his Mail Handler duties. We find that there were no effective means available to accommodate Complainant in the position he held, which raises the issue of reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Reita M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120150260 (July 19, 2017). We therefore turn to whether the Agency met its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. S2 determined that Complainant could not be accommodated in his Mail Handler position. As Complainant could not be accommodated in his current position, we find that the Agency, absent undue hardship, was obligated to consider reassigning him to a different position, consistent with the Commission's regulations noted above. The Agency did not do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden now shifts to the Agency to provide case-specific evidence proving that providing reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship in the particular circumstances. A determination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including: (1) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed; (2) the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the effect on expenses and resources of the facility; (3) the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type and location of facilities of the employer; (4) the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation to the employer; and (5) the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility. <span class="Italic">See Julius C. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151295 (June 16, 2017); Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, neither in its decision nor on appeal has the Agency submitted an argument that reassigning Complainant to a different position would have resulted in an undue hardship on its operations. Therefore, based on the record, we find that Complainant has established that he was denied reasonable accommodation for his disability as alleged in claims 1, 2, 5, and 10. Further due to the Agency's denial of reasonable accommodation, we find that the events alleged as claims 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 also constitute violations of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
