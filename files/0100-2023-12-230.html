<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-216"><span class="space">7.</span> Requests for Additional Information</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency should not dismiss a complaint when it has sufficient information to adjudicate the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shondra S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021004200 (2021) (citing <span class="Italic">Ross v. Postmaster General</span>, 05900693 (1990); <span class="Italic">Brinson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05900193 (1990)). "It is only in cases where the Complainant has engaged in delay or contumacious conduct and the record is insufficient to permit adjudication that the Commission has allowed a complaint to be dismissed for failure to cooperate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Card v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970095 (Apr. 23, 1998); <span class="Italic">Kroten v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940451 (Dec. 22, 1994)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not unreasonable for a complainant to respond to a notice of intent to dismiss for failure to prosecute by requesting additional time to review the counseling report before making a response. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lazarranga v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01883169 (1988). Likewise, it is not unreasonable for a complainant to request time to meet with his representative prior to responding to a request for additional information, <span class="Italic">Elam v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970397 (1997), or to request additional time due to health reasons, <span class="Italic">Nakis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990222 (1999). Further, it is error for an agency to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to cooperate where the complainant believes he has provided the relevant information and expresses confusion as to what is needed in the way of additional information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A51398 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sherman H. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020005281 (2020), despite the complainant's failure to timely respond to the agency's request for an affidavit, the Commission reversed dismissal for failure to cooperate where the record contained enough information to adjudicate the claim. Noting that the real prejudice, in the end, would be against the complainant if the ROI did not contain an affidavit by the complainant, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sherman H</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(7) requires that an agency dismiss a complaint where it has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information or otherwise proceed with the complaint, and the complainant has failed to respond to the request within 15 days of its receipt or the complainant's response does not address the agency's request, provided that the request included a notice of the proposed dismissal. Instead of dismissing for failure to cooperate, the complaint may be adjudicated if sufficient information for that purpose is available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not indicate that Complainant requested an extension or otherwise advised the Agency's EEO function prior to the dismissal of his complaint that he wished to continue going forward with his EEO case. But there is sufficient information in the record to adjudicate Complainant's complaint, i.e., his contentions are sufficiently clear, and the EEO investigator secured relevant documents and affidavits from involved management. At this point though, Complainant's failure to provide an affidavit does weaken his ability to prove his claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Shondra S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021004200 (2021), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal due to the complainant's failure to complete an affidavit package within the allotted 15 days. Crediting the complainant's personal circumstances as reason enough to reverse the agency's decision, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant, through counsel, asserts that over the past few months she has been dealing with mental and physical health diagnosis/treatments, the loss of family members, and Complainant indicated that she had been a victim of violence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that these stressors have caused her to experience various medical problems which have resulted in changes to her treatment plan. Complainant also explains that the pandemic delayed the time she would have normally needed to seek assistance with her personal issues. Complainant further explains that she now has legal counsel and she would like to an opportunity for her complaint to be adjudicated. Under these circumstances, we determine the evidence does not support a finding that Complainant engaged in delay or contumacious conduct that would merit dismissal on the grounds determined by the Agency. Complainant is advised, however, to cooperate in the continued processing of the instant complaint or face possible dismissal of the complaint for failure to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency should have completed its investigation of the complaint and allowed for a decision on the merits rather than dismissing the formal complaint for failure to cooperate. The Agency's dismissal is REVERSED, and the formal complaint is REMANDED to the Agency for further processing in accordance with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly reversed an agency's dismissal of a complaint for failure to respond to a request for information in <span class="Italic">Franchesca V. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2021000316 (2021), where the complainant had limited access to a computer and noted as much in her complaint. In an interesting decision, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that Complainant filed her formal complaint on February 8, 2018. Over two and a half years later the Agency attempted to contact her via telephone and email for information regarding her complaint. There is nothing in the record to show that any other contact was made during that two and a half years. We note that one of Complainant's claims was that she had limited computer access at work, and only with management oversight. In her appeal, Complainant explains she does not have a personal computer at home, and that the phone she had belonged to her son and she no longer had it. Further, she states that the Agency used the wrong email address for her representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, Complainant noted that she had previously used the base library's computers, but because of the pandemic it has just recently opened on a modified schedule. It was also noted that Complainant was not informed by her supervisor at work that there had been a telephone call for her. Finally, we note that the Agency did not attempt to contact Complainant by mail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the unique facts of this case, the Commission determines that it is appropriate to reverse the agency's dismissal and remand the complaint for further processing. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that the time limitations provided for in the EEO complaint processing regulations are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. Under this authority, we find that this is an appropriate case to excuse Complainant's failure to respond to the Agency's request for information given the lengthy lapse of time in the Agency's attempt to contact her. Further, the Agency did not attempt to reach her by mail when email and telephone calls provided no response.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant's limited access to the Internet, among other circumstances, also led the Commission to reverse the agency's dismissal of the complaint for failure to respond to interrogatory requests in <span class="Italic">Kristofer D. v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board</span>, 2021004213 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record indicates that Complainant retained counsel on April 29, 2021, approximately two months after the investigation closed on February 16, 2021, and requested a reopening of the investigation. Complainant's attorney explained that "due to personal issues beyond his control, [Complainant] did not participate in the investigation." However, on May 5, 2021, the Agency denied Complainant's request to reopen the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant's attorney asserts that: (1) Complainant did not have legal representation during the investigative process; (2) Complainant did not have a clear understanding of the EEO investigative process; and (3) Complainant had mitigating personal issues that <span id="Page_270"></span>prevented him from responding to the EEO investigator. Complainant's attorney notes Complainant informed the EEO Investigator that he thought the investigator was biased and was aligned with Agency officials. Additionally, Complainant informed the EEO Investigator twice that he was experiencing stress from his pending eviction from his home. Complainant's attorney further notes that on January 28, 2021, Complainant emailed the EEO Investigator and stated, "I live in a motel and I don't have internet access. This is over until I establish stability." Consequently, Complainant's personal problems, as well as general confusion about the EEO Investigator's role, prevented him from timely completing all steps in the EEO investigative process. Under these circumstances, we determine the evidence does not support a finding that Complainant engaged in contumacious conduct that would merit dismissal on the grounds determined by the Agency. Complainant, however, is advised to cooperate in the continued processing of the instant complaint or face possible future dismissal for failure to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's final decision dismissing the instant formal complaint is REVERSED and the formal complaint is REMANDED to the Agency for further processing in accordance with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission's regulations require that a complainant be given 15 days to respond to a request for information, this does not mean that an agency, in all circumstances, can give only 15 days. The Commission has held that dismissal for failure to prosecute was improper where the agency's request for information was lengthy, and the complainant contacted the agency and indicated he could not respond within 15 days and attempted to work out a way he could respond to the request for additional information. <span class="Italic">Mignone v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01960036 (1996). In finding that the agency in <span class="Italic">Mignone</span> had abused its discretion in not granting the complainant more time, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's request consisted of more than four pages of detailed questions, which included numerous subparts and requests for "proof" in support of appellant's claims. For example, with respect to allegation 4, the agency asked the complainant to clarify the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To whom did you make this request [for LWOP]? Who denied the LWOP? How many hours did you request and for what reason? How did you resolve the situation? Did you take leave? What type of leave did you take and how much of each different category of leave was taken? Please explain how you were negatively harmed or aggrieved by this action. Please provide proof of the request and the denial if they were done in writing. When did you request the LWOP? Exactly when was the LWOP denied? What period of time did the request cover?</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant established that he promptly notified the agency that he did not believe that he could comply with the request for clarification within the 15-day time frame because he was ill and because of the magnitude of the agency's request. He indicated that the agency refused to extend the 15-day time frame for responding to the request and also refused to permit him to submit his response piecemeal as he completed each section. The Commission found that, given the scope and magnitude of the agency's request for clarification, the agency's expectation that appellant should have been able to respond in full within 15 days appeared to have been unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Natalya B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020005270 (2020), the Commission excused the complainant's failure to cooperate with the investigation and reversed dismissal of her complaint where the complainant explained that COVID-19 caused her delay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant explains why she was unable to respond to the affidavit request at that time. According to Complainant, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, her son's school closed as did her younger son's day care. Then her son's father got the Covid virus, and within weeks his grandparents and aunt also caught the virus. She notes that she was 9 months pregnant. Based on all these factors, Complainant asserts she was unable to submit the affidavit during the period at issue. She now represents that her circumstances have improved and she will fully participate in the processing of her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the unique facts of this case, the Commission determines that it is appropriate to reverse the Agency's dismissal and remand the complaint for further processing. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that the time limitations provided for in the EEO complaint processing regulations are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. Under this authority, we find that this is an appropriate case to excuse Complainant's failure to timely respond to the affidavit request given the unique impact that Covid-19 had on her family as well as her pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Natacha M. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 2020003285 (2020) (refusing to excuse a few day delay in filing formal complaint where complainant alleged that she thought the EEO process was on "pause" during COVID-19). See elsewhere in this chapter and in <a href="0100-2023-11-001.html#sec2-1">Chapters 2</a>, <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec14-1">14</a>, and <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec15-1">15</a> for more on COVID-19.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency may dismiss a complaint for failure to prosecute when the appellant refuses to clarify vague allegations, it may not do so when the appellant has provided all of the information to the best of her ability or when the record is already sufficiently fulsome in order to issue a notice accepting or dismissing the claims. In <span class="Italic">Kamecka v. Department of Army</span>, 01830358 (1983), the appellant alleged that she was the target of harassment due to her national origin because she was under surveillance by fellow employees. The appellant also alleged that a dentist had implanted a transmitter in her teeth which allowed the agency to monitor her speech, thoughts, and body functions. The appellant in<span class="Italic"> Kamecka</span> alleged that the motive was a "family surveillance swindle, with international and political implications" and that she was related to Catherine the Great:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision to cancel a complaint should be made by the agency only when the action of the complainant obstructs the complaint process, or when the complainant's actions clearly indicates a lack of interest in pursuing the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the complainant fails entirely to respond to a request for additional information, if the record is sufficiently detailed to determine whether a complaint should be accepted or dismissed, the agency must issue a decision based on that information rather than dismissing the complaint for the complainant's failure to respond. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Angelica P. v. EEOC</span>, 0120170446 (2017), where the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal based on the complainant's failure to respond to a written request for information within the time allotted. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Angelica P</span>. noted that the complainant had already provided enough detail to the investigator for the agency to assess whether the complaint should be accepted or dismissed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that information from the EEO Counselor's report and Complainant's formal complaint was sufficient to issue a notice accepting or dismissing the claims. We note that the Investigator also had detailed responses from Complainant's June 15, 2016 e-mail, which aligned closely with the claims that were initially captured by the EEO Counselor. For example, Complainant provided names of management officials, specific allegations, and relevant time frames. This information was sufficient to proceed with the notice of acceptance and begin the investigation. If the Investigator obtained further information after interviews to clarify and add detail to the claims as demonstrated in the declaration sent to Complainant, this information could have been incorporated into the notice of acceptance, which allows for Complainant's response. EEO Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110), at Chap. 5 &#x00A7; 1. Further follow-up from the investigator to gain additional facts and obtain a declaration from Complainant would have been appropriate during investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, unlike in the cases cited above, Complainant responded in detail to several of the Investigator's inquiries. It was only after the Investigator sent the declaration, which upon review appears to differ in several respects from Complainant's allegations as captured by the EEO Counselor and the formal complaint, that Complainant did not respond. Further, while it might be presumed that Complainant received notification that her complaint would be dismissed, whether she in fact received the notice cannot be confirmed because the Investigator sent the notice to Complainant's personal e-mail, which does not allow for tracking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Complainant purposely engaged in delay or contumacious conduct, and there is sufficient information in the record to have permitted the Agency to begin an investigation. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120113028 (finding that "information provided on complainant's claims was sufficient to identify the specific management actions he is concerned with, the relevant timeframes and the responsible management officials" which was "sufficient information to permit management witnesses to respond to complainant's allegations"). Accordingly, we direct the Agency, upon remand, to commence an investigation of Complainant's complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC dismissed the complaint, however, on the ground that the allegations were outside the purview of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Vanderwarf v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963263 (1997) (where the complainant, within the required 15 days, makes a good faith effort to respond to the agency's request for information, dismissal is inappropriate). The dismissal provision applies "only in cases where there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by complainant." <span class="Italic">Carson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980150 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Card v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970095 (1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent">When there is sufficient information in the record that the complainant states a claim, the agency errs by dismissing for failure to cooperate based on an argument that it could not decipher what injury complainant was alleging. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Curry v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A00069 (2001). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Curry</span> noted that the counselor's report established that complainant was alleging retaliation/harassment when his job duties were changed as the result of a certain memo. The Commission concluded that "[t]he agency's request for information as to how complainant suffered a personal injury was, therefore, unnecessary. Complainant's complaint states a claim of discrimination and should have been accepted for investigation. Complainant's failure to restate information which he previously had provided is an insufficient basis for dismissal."</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01994138 (2002). In <span class="Italic">Spencer</span> the Commission determined the agency erred by dismissing a complaint for failure to cooperate where most of the information <span id="Page_271"></span>requested by the agency was within its possession or readily apparent from the complaint. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Spencer</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, complainant's failure to respond to the agency's request for additional information did not significantly impede the agency's ability to process the complaint. First, the agency, as complainant's employer, should have been aware of complainant's reassigned duties and did not require information on this point from complainant. Second, the agency's request that complainant explain "how she suffered a personal loss or harm with regard to a term, condition, or privilege of employment" calls more for an explanation of the legal theory upon which complainant is proceeding than it does for factual information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It may be that the agency was asking complainant to explain why her complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim. But the only proper questions in determining whether a complainant states a claim within the purview of the EEO process are (1) whether the complainant is an aggrieved employee and (2) whether he has alleged employment discrimination covered by the EEO statutes. An employee is "aggrieved" if he has suffered direct and personal deprivation at the hands of the employer<span class="Italic">. See Hobson v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05891133 (March 2, 1990). Here, complainant alleged that her superior's deliberately withheld information from her that related to her job performance, that another employee was promoted to a position that overlapped with hers and caused her duties to be reassigned, and that in retaliation, her superior's caused her Indian Preference to be removed after 26 years. These allegations relate directly to complainant's terms and conditions of employment. Therefore, complainant's claim is sufficient to render her an aggrieved employee. Finally, because complainant has alleged that the adverse action was based on sex, age, race, and EEO reprisal, she has raised a claim within the purview of the EEOC regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Garner v. General Services Administration</span>, 0120064867 (2008); <span class="Italic">Blinston v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24778 (2003) (complainant failed to respond to two requests for an affidavit, but had given a five-page statement with details of the alleged discrimination at the counseling stage).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A21254 (2003), the Commission found the complainant's failure and refusal to provide additional information was contumacious conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to issue (i), we find that the agency properly dismissed this issue for failure to cooperate. The record contains a letter dated November 1, 2001, wherein the agency requested additional information regarding issue (i) of complainant's complaint. The letter requested the specific dates of the incidents and the names of the persons involved besides complainant, Person F, and S1. The letter advised complainant that failure to respond to the request within fifteen calendar days could lead to dismissal of this issue. In her response, complainant stated that she was declining to provide any additional information. On appeal, complainant asserts that she did not provide the requested information because she was afraid that the EEO office would give the information to management. The Commission finds that the agency's request for the dates of the incidents was reasonable and that complainant has explicitly stated that she will not comply with the agency's request. The agency can not be expected to investigate the claim without complainant explaining the time frames at issue; nor can the agency determine whether such a claim was raised in a timely manner. Therefore, we find that the dismissal of issue (i) for failure to cooperate was proper pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(7).</p>
<p class="noindent">It would seem a response, any response, will prevent dismissal for failure to cooperate. In <span class="Italic">Hall v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01984965 (1999), the Commission found the agency improperly dismissed the complaint for failure to cooperate where the complainant responded to the agency's notices, even though her responses did not comply with the agency's request to clarify her allegations. However, the Commission found the complaint should be dismissed for failure to submit to EEO counseling. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hall</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency twice notified appellant that her failure to respond to their correspondence within 15 days would result in dismissal, on November 4, 1997, and on December 30, 1997. In both instances, however, appellant responded to these notices of proposed dismissal, and therefore dismissal pursuant to EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(f) is improper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's complaint is more properly analyzed, however, for whether appellant raised matters that were not addressed in counseling. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a) requires complainants to undergo counseling prior to filing a formal complaint. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(b) states, in pertinent part, that an agency shall dismiss a complaint or portion thereof which raises a matter that has not been brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor, and is not like or related to a matter on which the complainant has received counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency contends that appellant requested that her September 11, 1997 letter serve as a formal complaint, and appellant does not dispute this finding. Therefore, the Commission will regard appellant's letter, dated September 11, 1997 and entitled "Notice of Formal EEO Complaint," as her formal complaint of discrimination. Further, appellant does not dispute that she interrupted the EEO Counselor's attempt to discuss her allegations, and otherwise refused to undergo counseling by dodging numerous agency letters and contacts through her admitted strategy of checking mail only once every three weeks, and refusing to give her phone number to her EEO Counselor. Accordingly, appellant has not received counseling on any of the allegations raised in her September 11, 1997 formal complaint, and her complaint should have been dismissed pursuant to EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120151154 (2015), the Commission reversed an agency dismissal for failure to cooperate where the complainant contended that all previous correspondence with the EEO office had been by certified mail and she did not realize the email from the EEO office was related to her complaint and she deleted it without reading it.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted in <a href="0100-2023-11-001.html#sec2-1">Chapter 2</a>, the counselor and the complainant are supposed to agree upon the claim or claims brought to the counselor's attention. In most agencies, once a complaint has been accepted and the claims defined, the complainant is given an opportunity to comment on the definition of the claims within a specified time period. Although that opportunity is not a required part of the agency's processing of a complaint, it is a good idea. In <span class="Italic">Herling v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986957 (2001), the Commission rejected a complainant's challenge to a final agency decision based on the contention that the agency had not properly identified and defined the claims in the complaint. In affirming the agency's final decision, the Commission noted that the complainant had been given seven days after the agency's acceptance of the complaint and definition of the claims to make any objections to the defined claims. The complainant failed to respond and the Commission found that the agency's definition of the claims was proper. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Oatez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992594 (2001), the Commission found it was error for the agency to dismiss a complaint for failure to cooperate after it was remanded to the agency by an administrative judge with instructions to conduct a supplemental investigation. Although the judge specifically instructed the complainant to give an affidavit and the agency made several attempts to secure one, the complainant refused to supply an affidavit. The Commission found the agency erred in dismissing the complaint and remanded the case for a decision on the record. The Commission did construe the lack of cooperation by the complainant to constitute a constructive withdrawal of his request for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency may not rely upon technicalities and dismiss a complaint where the complainant provides information that is responsive to the agency's request, but does so in an untimely manner. For example in <span class="Italic">Fassett v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01996170 (2001), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complaint where the complainant's attorney responded to the agency's request one week after expiration of the 15-day deadline, but prior to the agency's dismissal of the complaint. The Commission noted the attorneys provided the information requested by the agency "rendering the record sufficient for further processing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Spates v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12037 (2001) (dismissal was improper where an affidavit was supplied several weeks after the passage of 15-day deadline).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant previously provided the requested information, the agency may not issue a second request for the information and then dismiss the complaint when the complainant fails to respond. The complainant has no obligation to provide information already provided. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Danelishen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955423 (1996). Similarly, where the information requested is in the agency's possession, it may not dismiss the complaint for failure to cooperate if the complainant refuses to respond. <span class="Italic">See Battaglia v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01965598 (1997) (information on training denied to the complainant should be in agency's possession).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not dismiss a complaint for failure to prosecute where the complainant simply cannot provide the information sought. In <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01941358 (1994), the complainant initiated counseling alleging that he was denied training. The complainant stated that he submitted a request for training to his supervisor on a certain date and never received a response. The agency dismissed the complaint after asking the complainant to identity the date on which he was denied training. The complainant did respond to the agency's request in a timely fashion, but could not provide the requested information. The Commission reversed the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that since appellant purportedly never received a response to his request for training from his supervisor, his failure to identify specific dates when he was denied training did not constitute delay or contumacious conduct on his part for further processing of his complaint. Appellant identified the date when he requested training, and identified a person to whom the request was made; thus, we find that the agency has sufficient information for further processing of allegation....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01965765 (1997) (overturning dismissal of the complaint where an employee could not remember a date which the agency could have ascertained from its own records); <span class="Italic">Ransom v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01966881 (1997) (overturning the dismissal of a complaint where justification for the complainant's performance rating was in the agency's <span id="Page_272"></span>possession); <span class="Italic">Fields v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01965393 (1997) (overturning dismissal of a complaint where the complainant did not provide the names of comparative employees). In <span class="Italic">Nicoloudakis v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960857 (1997), the Commission found that the submission of information about the wrong complaint did not constitute failure to prosecute. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Nicoloudakis</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, appellant asserted that he mailed a completed set of documents to the agency on December 1, 1995. The agency did not rebut his assertion. Although appellant later conceded that he provided information about the wrong complaint, the Commission nonetheless finds that he responded to the agency's request. Under the circumstances, the Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cordoves v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01962014 (1996), held that one instance of failure to respond to an agency's request for additional information, even if accompanied by the proper dismissal notice, is not sufficient to warrant dismissal. On the other hand, dismissal is clearly improper when the agency has failed to give the required notice indicating that failure to respond will result in dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Todd v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01970722 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency must not be too premature in dismissing a complaint for failure to prosecute where it believes the allegations are too vague for investigation. In <span class="Italic">Oliver v. USPS</span>, 01821990 (1982), the agency dismissed the employee's complaint after requesting clarification and receiving what the employee stated he believed was a partial listing of the dates and incidents of discrimination. The Commission found the dismissal of the complaint to be "unreasonable" and admonished the agency that if, after receiving the complainant's partial list, it still believed the allegations were too vague for investigation, the complainant should have been notified of that fact and given an additional opportunity to submit clarifications. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120112747 (2011), the Commission found that the agency was too quick to dismiss for failure to cooperate where the complainant had two deaths in her family, his lawyer had health problems, and the complainant did make an effort to provide the additional information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's formal complaint for failure to cooperate. Complainant's attorney received the Agency's request for additional information on March 7, 2011. Thus, the 15 day time period would have expired on March 22, 2011. While the Agency, in its final decision, asserts that Complainant did not submit a response to the Agency's request for additional information, the record does not support this assertion. The record contains a response letter from Complainant dated March 22, 2011 and postmarked March 23, 2011. Therein, Complainant states "I apologize for not contacting your office sooner, however, [my attorney] and myself haven't been able to make contact with each other until the evening of March 21, 2011. I have had two deaths in my family within these past two weeks and my attorney has had health issues himself." Complainant's response also provides answers to the Agency's information request. We note that the Commission has held that an Agency's decision to invoke the provisions of 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(7) should be made only when there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct. <span class="Italic">Kroeten v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940451 (Dec. 22, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Estrada v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960798 (1996), the Commission held that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute where the agency sent a request for additional information to the complainant in care of the union president. The agency offered no evidence to refute the complainant's contention that he never received the request for information.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in two cases decided in 1997, the Commission upheld dismissal of the complaints, not because of failure to cooperate, but because the lack of information on the allegations made them so vague the complaint failed to state a claim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lazur v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01970504 (1997), the Commission noted that the complainant failed to provide the information requested by the agency, but dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Glinton v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01970091 (1997). It is not clear from these cases whether the Commission believes that a vague complaint can be dismissed for failure to state a claim without regard to whether the complainant has failed to cooperate in further clarifying the complaint. However, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12020 (2001), the Commission specifically upheld dismissal of a complaint for failure to prosecute where the complainant's attorney neglected to provide the agency with the requested affidavit. Though it is less than clear from the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> decision, the agency argued that the complaint was too vague to investigate without the additional information and it appears the Commission agreed.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency cannot dismiss a complaint for failure to cooperate simply because the complainant has had previous complaints dismissed on the same basis. In <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965048 (1997), the Commission found that, despite the fact that the complainant failed to cooperate in an earlier case, there was sufficient information in the instant case for the agency to adjudicate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the agency did send a letter to appellant dated January 10, 1996 requesting that appellant submit an affidavit responding to the interrogatories of the investigator. Appellant has apparently not provided the requested affidavit. The Commission finds that the agency has failed to show the allegations could not be adjudicated without appellant's affidavit. The agency has not shown in its dismissal letter, or on appeal, what information was necessary for appellant to provide in his affidavit so that the allegations could be adjudicated. For instance, the agency has not claimed that the matter could not be adjudicated without the affidavit because the allegations were too vague to investigate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency argues that the instant case is nearly identical to <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960702 (Apr. 18, 1996), which involved the same appellant. In EEOC Appeal No. 01960702 the Commission found that the agency properly dismissed appellant's complaints for failure to cooperate<span class="Italic">. Fisher</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960702. Unlike the instant case, however, the Commission in EEOC Appeal No. 01960702 found that "the agency properly dismissed the complaints for failure to cooperate as the record did not have the necessary information to permit further processing of the complaints."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The Commission finds in the instant matter that the agency has failed to show that there was insufficient information to adjudicate the allegations. Therefore, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the allegations for failure to cooperate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that in <span class="Italic">Fisher</span> the Commission focused exclusively on whether the failure to cooperate prevented the agency from investigating the complaint and not on the failure to cooperate itself.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ochoa v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975240 (1998), found that dismissal for failure to prosecute was proper where a notice of appearance indicated that the complainant was represented by an attorney, and the attorney failed to respond to requested information. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ochoa</span> rejected the complainant's and attorney's assertion that there was no attorney-client relationship pointing to a notice of appearance that apparently was never rescinded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant argues that his complaint was improperly dismissed for failure to prosecute. Appellant specifically argues that he had provided a written detailed account of the incidents of discrimination, as well as addressing the allegations with an agency EEO official over the telephone. Appellant further argues that the Attorney "is not my attorney and is not representing me" and that "I do not have an attorney at this time and did not have an attorney at the time I initiated this complaint." Appellant argues that the Attorney had no reason to respond to the agency's request for an affidavit because he did not represent appellant. Finally, appellant argues that had he been notified, he would have willingly provided the requested affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency argues that "the evidence speaks for itself" regarding appellant's assertion that he did not have a representative at any time during the processing of the instant complaint. Specifically, the agency argues that it was apprised during precomplaint processing that appellant was represented by the Attorney; and that the Attorney submitted a Notice of Appearance to the agency in September 1996 (a copy of this Notice is not in the record). The agency further argues that appellant indicated on his complaint form that he was represented by the Attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case contains a letter dated August 26, 1997, from the Attorney submitted in support of appellant's arguments on appeal. Therein, the Attorney states that he is responding to the agency's arguments on appeal, though he is not compelled to do so; that he does not and has never represented appellant in the instant complaint; and that he has previously interviewed appellant but, because of his professional duties, will not discuss the nature of that meeting. The Attorney argues that he never entered an appearance on appellant's behalf in the instant complaint, and that the agency's reliance on correspondence sent to him regarding the request for the submission of an affidavit was therefore improper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation[s] provides that the agency shall dismiss a complaint or a portion of a complaint where the agency has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information or otherwise proceed with the complaint, and the complainant has failed to respond to the request within 15 days of its receipt. Instead of dismissing for failure to cooperate, the complaint may be adjudicated if sufficient information for that purpose is available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation[s] provides that unless the complainant states otherwise in writing, after the agency has received written notice of the name, address and telephone number of an attorney representative for the complainant, service of documents and decisions on the complainant shall be made on the attorney and not on the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that only where the complainant has engaged in delaying or contumacious conduct and the record is insufficient to permit adjudication will the Commission allow a complaint to be dismissed for failure to prosecute<span class="Italic">. See Delgado v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900859 (October 25, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_273"></span>In this case, we find that appellant had notified the agency, in writing, that he was represented by counsel. In a formal complaint signed by appellant, appellant expressly stated that the Attorney represented him; and provided an address for the Attorney. Pursuant to appellant's assertion that he was represented by counsel in the manner described above, the agency submitted requests to the Attorney for an affidavit that would provide information the agency deemed necessary for the further processing of the allegations the agency had accepted for investigation. Based on appellant's representations, these requests were sent by certified mail in March and May 1997, to the Attorney's address as provided by appellant. On appeal, appellant now argues that, contrary to the information he provided in his formal complaint, he was never represented by the Attorney in the instant complaint. We find, however, that based on the present record, the agency properly served documents on the Attorney identified by appellant as his representative; appellant never notified the agency, in writing, that the Attorney was no longer his representative, in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(d). Accordingly, we find that the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint for failure to prosecute was proper and is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a complainant contends that he or she did not receive the agency's request for additional information, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that it made the request and that the complainant received the request. The Commission will apply the doctrine of constructive receipt and deem a request received if the agency demonstrates it was delivered to a family member of suitable age and discretion at the complainant's address. For a further discussion of "<a href="0100-2023-11-121.html#sec2-121">Constructive Receipt of Notice</a>," see Chapter 2.</p>
