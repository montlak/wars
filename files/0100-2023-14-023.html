<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-23"><span class="space">1.</span> Waiving Prospective Rights</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although a Title VII complainant can waive protection for antecedent acts, provided the waiver is knowing and voluntary, she cannot waive prospective Title VII rights. <span class="Italic">See Seaverson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880920 (1988). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Seaverson</span> invalidated a clause in an agreement that provided that if the appellant did not adhere to the terms of settlement, then she could be terminated without recourse to the EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The waiver of rights in a settlement agreement must be knowing and voluntary, but if those requirements are met, the Commission is liberal in terms of what rights can be waived. In <span class="Italic">Rademaker v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01842536 (1985), the appellant entered a settlement in which she agreed not to apply for any agency jobs in the future. Appellant did, however, apply for a job and then filed a complaint over her nonselection. On appeal, the EEOC upheld the agency's dismissal of her complaint on the basis that the appellant was not an aggrieved employee because she was not properly an applicant for employment. However, language that waives "all claims, complaints, and actions Aggrieved Person/Complainant has or may have against the Agency," was invalid and unenforceable in <span class="Italic">Felton M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120171896 (2017), because the language could be construed as waiving future, unknowable claims. "It is axiomatic that parties may only agree to resolve actual existing disputes, not ones that post-date the Agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant enters into a settlement waiving his EEO rights with respect to the settled complaint does not act as a general waiver of EEO complaint rights or bar a subsequent complaint based on a later incident. <span class="Italic">See Hedderman v. USPS</span>, 01830654 (1983). An agency may not dismiss a complainant's allegations of misrepresentation and breach of the settlement agreement on the theory that the agreement at issue contains a waiver of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920560 (1993). The waiver of appeal rights applies only to the underlying complaint of discrimination and not to enforcement of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a subtle, yet important, distinction between the <span class="Italic">Rademaker</span> case and the <span class="Italic">Hedderman</span> and <span class="Italic">O'Brien</span> cases. In <span class="Italic">Rademaker</span>, the employee was not asked to waive a future right to file a complaint. She was asked to waive her right to seek future employment with the agency. The agreement was valid because there was no prospective waiver of EEO rights. Indeed, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Rademaker</span> was permitted to file and pursue her complaint to the point of dismissal with the agency and on appeal to the Commission. Ultimately, the Commission found that, because she had no right to seek employment with the agency, she could not be aggrieved by the agency's refusal to hire her. As a result, the complaint was dismissed because the complainant failed to state a claim for relief. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Hedderman</span> and <span class="Italic">O'Brien</span>, the agency attempted to use the waiver to actually bar a future EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Royal v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01903626 (1990), the Commission refused to honor a settlement agreement waiving future EEO rights that had been upheld by the MSPB. In that case, the appellant, faced with removal on AWOL charges, confessed to being an alcoholic and entered into a "last chance" settlement agreement with the agency. Under the agreement, the appellant was required to stay in her treatment program and avoid any further discipline for one year. Her failure to abide by either condition in the ensuing year would result in her removal. Under the agreement, the appellant, through her representative, waived any right to challenge a removal based on further disciplinary charges. Following her subsequent removal, the appellant filed an appeal with the MSPB, alleging that she was under the influence of alcohol and did not understand her actions at the time she authorized her representative to enter the agreement. The appellant also alleged that the agency failed to offer reasonable accommodation of her disabling condition. The Board dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional grounds, finding that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Royal</span> waived her right to challenge the removal by entering into the last chance agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Board ruled in favor of the agency on the jurisdictional issue when it determined that appellant's "waiver of her appeal rights" was voluntary, freely made, and fair. According to its procedures, the Board made this finding without considering appellant's claim of discrimination. Indeed, the Commission notes that appellant's claim of discrimination relating to her handicap issues has never been fully considered due to the label of "mixed case." Given this context, and considering the Commission's statutory mission to eradicate discrimination in the workplace, we find that this matter is one which must be addressed by the EEO process, not the "mixed case" process. We find support for this policy in the Board's action as well. The Board held in its decision on this case that the matter of appellant's EEO waiver was not appealable to the Board. In effect, the Board held that the case was no longer "mixed." In view of the Board's position, and given the statutory mission of this Commission, we find that appellant's complaint of discrimination will be considered as a valid appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_355"></span>EEOC regulations encourage voluntary resolutions of EEO complaints but a complainant may validly waive <span class="Italic">only</span> those claims arising from "discriminatory acts or practices which antedate the execution of the release." <span class="Italic">Rogers v. General Electric Co.</span>, 781 F.2d 452 (5th Cir. 1986), quoting <span class="Italic">Allegheny-Ludlum</span>, 517 F.2d 826, 853 (5th Cir. 1986). Thus, an otherwise valid release or agreement that waives prospective Title VII rights is invalid as violative of public policy<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Cosmair, Inc.</span>, 821 F.2d 1085 (5th Cir. 1987) (waiver of right to file EEOC charge is invalid as violative of public policy); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Vukovich</span>, 720 F.2d 909 (6th Cir. 1983) (consent decree containing impermissible waivers of future discrimination claims held invalid); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36 (1974) (an employee's rights under Title VII are not susceptible to prospective waiver). Accordingly, we find that in the present case the portion of the agreement that stipulated that appellant waive "her right to...file an EEO complaint or to pursue the matter under any other forum" is invalid and unenforceable. In other words, by representative's signature..., appellant could waive only those EEO claims arising "on or before" that date; she could not, however, waiver her rights to challenge any <span class="Italic">future</span> actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted, emphasis in original.) The Commission remanded the case for processing.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached by the Commission in considering the prospective waiver of rights under the Rehabilitation Act. In <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05901045 (1990), the Commission voided the entire settlement agreement because it found that the provisions of the agreement required the complainant to waive prospective accommodation rights under the Rehabilitation Act. The complainant suffered from a medical condition that required accommodation through seasonal permanent employment. In resolving a nonselection complaint in <span class="Italic">Bell</span>, the agency gave the complainant automatic consideration for vacancies but required that he accept an offer of full-time employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is persuaded by appellant's argument that the settlement agreement is void because of the provision that he would accept full-time employment if it were offered in the future, although appellant has asserted that he requires an alternative to full-time employment as reasonable accommodation to a handicap. We agree that this provision of the settlement agreement effectively requires appellant to waive future rights to reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act and that these rights may not be waived <span class="Italic">prospectively</span>. Whether appellant is in fact a qualified handicapped person and whether a permanent seasonal schedule constitutes reasonable accommodation or would be an undue hardship on the agency are merits determinations to be made in the context of each specific request for accommodation. However, a settlement agreement that provides that appellant waives his right to certain accommodation in regard to future employment possibilities is not valid or enforceable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Major Mack v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01900148 (January 26, 1990) (agency wrongfully rejected an EEO complaint brought under the Rehabilitation Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended, 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>., challenging the complainant's removal where he had signed a "last chance" agreement waiving the right to file an EEO complaint if he were removed. An "agency cannot foreclose any future statutory rights conferred on complainants...under the disguise of a settlement[.]"); <span class="Italic">Seaverson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (appellant did not validly waive her right to file an EEO complaint under a "last chance" agreement because "[t]here can be no prospective waiver" of statutory EEO rights.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that...the settlement agreement herein is invalid because it does not comport with the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, and in this regard we find precedential our decision in <span class="Italic">Talmadge</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, cited by appellant. In that case, the complainant was a mail handler with an upper arm disability that prevented him from lifting more than 50 pounds. He applied but was not selected for a position as a tool and parts clerk because of his lifting restriction. An agreement in settlement of his EEO complaint provided that he would supply the agency with updated medical information and would be placed in the position of tool and parts clerk if he met the physical requirements of the job. In that case, we found that the settlement ignored the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and "place[d] the onus on appellant to meet the physical requirements of the position, with no mention of reasonable accommodation." Accordingly, we held that settlement was worded in contravention of the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act and was therefore void.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the settlement agreement herein requires appellant to forgo seasonal employment, which he asserts is a reasonable accommodation to a handicap and which he was in fact granted due to his physician's recommendation during his agency employment in California. The settlement places on appellant the onus of complying with the existing schedule of the position he seeks without mentioning reasonable accommodation. We therefore find that the settlement herein is void because it is in contravention of the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. Appellant is therefore entitled to reinstatement of his underlying complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important to note that in cases where settlement agreements are voided because of a waiver of prospective rights, the standard remedy is reinstatement of the complaint, as opposed to enforcement of the agreement without the offending provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Mello v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944734 (1995), the Commission indicated that voiding an entire settlement agreement is never appropriate, even when the agency includes a prospective waiver of EEO rights as a provision of the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Mello</span>, the agency entered into a last chance settlement agreement with the complainant that provided that he attend AA meetings and document his attendance with the agency. The complainant waived his right to challenge any future removal for failure to comply with the agreement. However, in the settlement agreement, the agency also informed the complainant of the position of the EEOC and the courts that prospective waiver of EEO rights was impermissible. The Commission found that voiding the agreement was not appropriate. In its decision, the Commission did not discuss either the <span class="Italic">Talmadge</span> or <span class="Italic">Bell</span> case, but relied on <span class="Italic">Royal</span> for the proposition that only the offending clause is void.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has continued to follow its holding in <span class="Italic">Mello</span> in later cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hebb v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090954 (2009) ("In cases in which there is a prospective waiver, only the prospective waiver provision, not the entire settlement agreement, is invalid.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The prohibition against waiving antecedent rights does not prevent an agency and an employee from entering into a settlement agreement on a pending removal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01974596 (1998), the Commission found the employee properly waived his rights where he entered a settlement agreement calling for his voluntary resignation the day before a notice of removal became effective.</p>
<p class="noindent">A settlement agreement may not be premised upon requiring that a disabled employee pass a medical examination certifying he can perform all the duties of a position. Such an agreement violates the Rehabilitation Act by requiring the complainant to waive his right to a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Thorton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912710 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a complainant can waive all claims through the date of settlement, that rule does not apply to a claim of which the complainant is unaware at the time of settlement. In <span class="Italic">Higgins v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A15009 (2002), without deciding the precise date on which a performance award was denied, the Commission held that the "complainant was not aware of the purported discriminatory event at the time that the agreement was executed, and could not have agreed to waive her right to pursue it, because that 'right' was not triggered until she became aware of the alleged discriminatory event." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency drafts the waiver language, it will be strictly construed and any doubt will likely be resolved in favor of the complainant. For example, in <span class="Italic">Platt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A34031 (2003), the complainant entered into a settlement agreement with the agency that settled all of the complainant's "outstanding EEO appeals." The provision went on to list the case numbers of several of these "appeals" and indicated that the withdrawal "included but is not limited to" those appeals. At the time the complainant entered into the agreement, he was in the precomplaint counseling stage of a complaint not listed in the agreement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Platt</span> held that the complainant did not withdraw the matter in precomplaint counseling as part of the settlement agreement. The Commission found the phrase "EEO appeals" rather than "EEO complaints" to be vague because it did not specify if it applied to formal complaints or complaints at any stage of the process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In some instances, a last chance settlement agreement that holds a removal in abeyance while an employee attempts rehabilitative efforts may give the employee a "firm choice" between seeking treatment for substance or alcohol abuse and continued employment. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Labor</span>, 03910017 (1991). Although the employee cannot waive his right to challenge future actions under a last chance agreement, the Commission gave a strong indication that it would uphold future action, after review, if the employee did not keep his end of the bargain. For further discussion of <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, see Chapter 15 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-24-069.html#sec15-52">The MSPB and EEOC--Causal Connection and Punishment</a>." (It should be noted that the Commission has since reversed itself on the issue of firm choice and now holds that the agency is not required to give the employee a firm choice as part of its reasonable accommodation efforts.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where an agreement does not specifically waive the complainant's rights to future claims of discrimination, an agency must be careful not to impose terms that <span class="Italic">per se</span> preclude further action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ashcraft v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01955432 (1996), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case the settlement agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;It is a material element of this agreement and an inducement of both sides to enter this agreement that [the agency] and [appellant] will perform in good faith, fairly and reasonably the provisions of this agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;On April 6, 1995, [the agency] will order and [appellant] will undertake the portion of the Practical Exercise Performance Requirements (PEPR) (excluding at that time the Physical Efficiency Battery (PEB) and Physical Conditioning) demonstrating her physical capabilities in firearms handling, firing and positions; driving a car; car stops; offensive and defense tactics; and arrest techniques.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_356"></span>3.&#x2003;This portion of the PEPR on April 6, 1995 will be observed and evaluated by a 3-member panel of instructors, (a) from individual courses taught in the 11-week Basic Land Management Training Programs, and (b) whose courses directly involve the portion(s) being evaluated.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Also, the parties may have observers for all or parts of the April 6, 1995 demonstration, including but not limited to the National Park Service (NPS) representative at [the agency], an NPS observer from Atlanta, [appellant's] attorney(s), [the agency's] attorney, and [the agency's] physician (for safety purposes, not as an evaluator).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;If [appellant] successfully completes the April 6, 1995 demonstration of her physical capabilities, [the agency] will enroll her in the next 11-week Basic Land Management Training Program....[The agency] further warrants that [appellant] will be in a certificate-eligible category in such event, not an audit status.</p>
<p class="noindent">The instructors in <span class="Italic">Ashcraft</span> found that the complainant was incapable of performing the required techniques in a successful manner due to her physical disability, and that additional training could not overcome this disability. In the complaint that followed, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ashcraft</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency maintains that, by entering into the settlement agreement, appellant agreed to the circumstances under which she would be evaluated and waived any entitlement to accommodation for her disability during the evaluation process. We disagree. We find that pursuant to the settlement agreement, appellant did not waive any prospective EEO claims that might arise.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03910140 (1992), the Commission held that a last chance agreement did provide a "firm choice" and upheld the removal of an employee who, as part of the agreement, had entered treatment and then suffered a relapse. In <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the Commission did not approach the case as involving a waiver of prospective rights to challenge the subsequent removal. Instead, it agreed with the agency that the earlier removal had simply been held in abeyance during the pendency of the employee's treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> case is significant because of its use of the concept of holding a removal in abeyance pending treatment. By holding the removal in abeyance as opposed to rescinding the removal, the agency does not run afoul of the prohibition against waiving future EEO rights. It can enforce the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alcoholism, last chance settlement agreements, and the issue of "firm choice" are treated in detail in Chapter 15 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-24-068.html#sec15-51">Alcohol and Substance Dependency</a>." The reader should be aware, as discussed below, that the Commission has rescinded the "firm choice" doctrine.</p>
