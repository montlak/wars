<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-111"><span class="space">F.</span> WAIVER OF PROSPECTIVE EEO CLAIMS AND LAST CHANCE SETTLEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">As noted in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-14-022.html#sec5-22">Waiver of Rights</a>," above, as consideration in a settlement agreement a complainant may not waive future EEO claims. The Commission, as previously noted, has been inconsistent on whether the inclusion of such a provision in a settlement agreement is merely unenforceable or renders the entire agreement void. Its current position is that the inclusion of clauses in a settlement agreement that constitute a waiver of prospective EEO rights does not void the entire agreement. Only those clauses that contain a waiver of prospective rights are void. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Briand-Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A31369 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Previously, the Commission had voided a number of agreements that included a provision waiving prospective EEO claims. But, in <span class="Italic">Mello v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944734 (1995), the Commission held that an entire settlement agreement is never voided by the inclusion of an illegal provision. In <span class="Italic">Mello</span>, the complainant argued that a last chance settlement agreement that provided for his removal without any recourse if he relapsed into alcoholism was invalid because it constituted a prospective waiver of EEO complaint rights. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mello</span> agreed that such a provision does constitute an illegal waiver, but declared the agreement otherwise valid:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, appellant argues that the Commission should not enforce the last chance agreement against him because it contained an illegal prospective waiver provision regarding EEO rights. We agree with the finding of the AJ that the term in the agreement providing for the prospective waiver of EEO appeal rights was invalid as violative of public policy, but this did not affect the validity of other portions of the agreement. In support of this, the AJ properly cited an EEOC case, <span class="Italic">i.e., Parks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922942 (June 1, 1992)<span class="Italic">. See also Morris v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900060 (May 31, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that the Commission has a contrary line of cases which calls for the invalidation of entire agreements that provide for a prospective waiver of an EEO rights term. In support thereof, appellant cites eight cases. However, a reading of the cases reveals that while some contain broad language, none stated the entire agreements were void. In fact, two of the cited cases clearly did not void the entire agreements. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Seaverson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01880920 (June 7, 1988), the Commission found a prospective waiver to be invalid, and instructed the agency on remand to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, investigate appellant's allegation that she signed the agreement at issue under duress. If the entire agreement was void, duress would not be an issue. The second case, <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01903626 (September 5, 1990), explicitly invalidated only the portion of the agreement that contained the prospective waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, appellant argues that in order to stop the deliberate practice of the agency of including illegal prospective waivers of EEO rights in agreements, the Commission should void the entire last chance agreement. After giving this matter some consideration, we decline to do so in this case. Appellant has been reasonably accommodated in that the agency made an affirmative effort to assist him overcome his disability. The prospective waiver did not undermine this. Further, the agency advised appellant of the view of the EEOC and courts regarding prospective waivers of EEO rights in the last chance agreement, and did not seek to enforce the waiver before the EEOC. Under these circumstances, we decline our discretion to impose sanctions at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission's ultimate position on voiding settlement agreements was unclear as a result of <span class="Italic">Mello</span>. Indeed, the <span class="Italic">Mello</span> case was a poor choice for the Commission to make any widespread proclamation on voiding settlement agreements, because, as the Commission noted, the specific agreement at issue notified the complainant of the position of the EEOC on prospective waiver of EEO rights and the agency did not seek to enforce the waiver before the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1996, the <span class="Italic">Mello</span> decision was further undermined by the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Boody v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01954828 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Boody</span>, the Commission, without mention of <span class="Italic">Mello</span>, again decided to void a settlement agreement because of its purported waiver of an antecedent discrimination claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.504(a) provides that any settlement agreement knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, reached at any stage of the complaint process, shall be binding on both parties. If the complainant believes that the agency has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement, the complainant shall notify the EEO Director, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance within 30 days of the date when the complainant knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance. The complainant may request that the terms of the settlement agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that provision 8 of the settlement agreement provides that if appellant was removed from agency employment, he agreed to waive all rights of appeal to the MSPB, to pursue a grievance under the Negotiated Grievance Procedure, or to pursue the matter under "any other forum." Provision 8 further provides that appellant agrees to withdraw the complaint which was settled by the agreement of January 14, 1994, and that he agrees "not to pursue these matters in any future action." We have previously held that complainants may waive <span id="Page_422"></span>the right to pursue EEO claims arising on or before the date of settlement; however, they may not waive their rights to challenge future actions<span class="Italic">. See Mole v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920235 (June 4, 1992). We find that provision 8 requires that appellant waive his right to future EEO claims and we therefore determine that the settlement agreement is invalid. Accordingly, the agency's decision not to reinstate appellant's complaint is REVERSED. The case is REMANDED to the agency to reinstate appellant's complaint for further processing, in accordance with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Bimes v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01962887 (1996), the Commission voided a settlement agreement that contained a clause under which the complainant waived his rights to file any future claims in any forum. The Commission declared the agreement "invalid." However, as discussed below, the Commission reversed itself in <span class="Italic">Bimes</span>, on reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Clay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952668 (1996), the Commission found another reason to reject an allegation that a last chance settlement agreement should be set aside because it required the complainant to waive antecedent EEO claims. The Commission found the complaint was untimely because the employee had not contacted a counselor within 45 days of entering the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Clay</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that appellant has entered into a last chance agreement with the agency on January 17, 1992, wherein appellant agreed to forego EEOC rights. An agreement which waives prospective EEO rights is invalid as violative of public policy<span class="Italic">. Morris v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900060 (May 31, 1990). Specifically, a "last chance" agreement's prospective waiver of EEO rights provision is not valid<span class="Italic">. Royal v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930326 (September 5, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant failed to contact an EEO Counselor at the time he entered into the last chance settlement agreement on January 17, 1992. Appellant argues that his initial EEO Counselor contact of April 13, 1994, was timely, as it occurred shortly after he was made aware, in March 1994, that an article in the Federal Times addressed the invalidity of last chance agreements that contain provisions providing for the waiver of prospective rights to pursue the EEO complaint process. We are unpersuaded by appellant's argument. Appellant does not argue that he was first aware that he was the victim of unlawful employment discrimination in March 1994; rather, he argues that he was first made aware at that time that the last chance agreement he had entered into in January 1992 improperly contained a waiver of his prospective EEO rights. Moreover, we find that appellant's reliance upon the Federal Times article of February 28, 1994, is misplaced. The Federal Times article upon which appellant relies notes that an Administrative Judge had determined that the last chance agreement that was the subject of the article never offered the complainant a firm choice between treatment and discipline. In contrast, the last chance agreement entered into by appellant clearly provided appellant with the option of either successfully completing an Employee Assistance Program or facing disciplinary action for not doing so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Courts have held that the limitations period for contacting an EEO Counselor begins to run when a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights knew or should have known that he was being discriminated against<span class="Italic">. Reed v. Economic Opportunity of Atlanta</span>, 516 F.2d 924, 931 (5th Cir. 1975). We find that appellant had, or should have had, a reasonable suspicion of unlawful employment discrimination at the time of his entry into the last chance agreement in January 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration, in <span class="Italic">Bimes v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05970359 (1997), the Commission reversed its earlier ruling and followed the <span class="Italic">Mello</span> decision. In doing so, it seemed to set down a bright-line rule that inclusion of a provision waiving prospective EEO rights is not a basis for voiding the settlement agreement. Instead, the agreement will be enforced without the offending clause. In <span class="Italic">Bimes</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant may validly waive only those claims arising from "'discriminatory acts or practices which antedate the execution of the release.'" <span class="Italic">Rogers v. General Electric Co.</span>, 781 F.2d 452 (5th Cir. 1986) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc.</span>, 517 F.2d 826, 835 (5th Cir. 1975)). Thus, a release or agreement that waives prospective Title VII rights is invalid as violative of public policy<span class="Italic">. Morris v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900060 (May 31, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fair reading of provisions c and d indicates that appellant agreed to waive any claims which he might have because of agency actions concerning his voluntary retirement or while he still was employed by the agency. Supporting this interpretation is provision h which states that "[t]he Complainant acknowledged this waiver does not waive any rights or claims under ADEA that arise after the execution of this agreement." Although the language of provisions c and d generally does not appear to be prospective in nature, those portions of provisions c and d regarding claims arising from appellant's employment with the agency nonetheless have a prospective effect under the facts of this case. That is, when the parties entered into the settlement agreement and appellant agreed to waive all claims arising from his employment, the agency had not yet issued the performance appraisal and appellant had no knowledge thereof. Applying the plain language of the settlement agreement in this case would bar appellant's claim on an issue that had not yet arisen when the parties entered into their agreement. Under these circumstances, the Commission finds that the settlement agreement does not bar appellant from bringing a complaint on the matter of his performance appraisal. The Commission further notes that in cases in which there is a prospective waiver, only the prospective waiver provision--not the entire settlement agreement--is invalid<span class="Italic">. See Mello v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 01944734 (August 10, 1995) (finding that a settlement agreement containing a prospective waiver which is invalid as violative of public policy does not affect the validity of other provisions of the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Commission reverses the previous decision's finding that the settlement agreement was invalid because provisions c and d constituted a prospective waiver of appellant's rights. The Commission remands this allegation to the agency so that it may refer appellant for EEO counseling thereon.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Maltaner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120101941 (2010) ("In cases in which there is a prospective waiver, on the prospective waiver provision, not the entire settlement agreement, is invalid.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's view that it will not enforce a prospective waiver of EEO rights puts it at odds with the Merit Systems Protection Board and its view on last chance settlement agreements. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Chatman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61580 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, complainant was removed effective August 26, 2005 on the grounds that he violated the LCA. Complainant filed an appeal with the MSPB. It issued an initial decision dated November 30, 2005 dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. It reasoned that under the LCA, complainant waived his appeal rights, and he did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that he did not violate the LCA. It found that while complainant raised race, age and disability discrimination, this did not confer jurisdiction onto the MSPB. The initial decision did not contain rights for complainant to file a petition with the EEOC. <span class="Italic">Chatman v. USPS</span>, MSPB docket no. AT-0752-05-0935-I-1, 2005 WL 374082 (Personnet) (November 30,2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the MSPB upholds prospective waivers of appeal rights under some circumstances, the EEOC does not recognize prospective waivers of EEO appeal rights<span class="Italic">. Morris v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900060 (May 31, 1990). The EEOC finds such waivers are invalid as violative of public policy. The provision that complainant could not appeal the prospective reinstatement of his removal is an invalid prospective waiver. Because the MSPB holds a contrary view and has denied jurisdiction over the August 26, 2005 removal, we will assume jurisdiction over the matter. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b). The August 26, 2005 removal matter states a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0520130461 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an agency is not precluded from removing a complainant for violating a last chance agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130190 (2014), the complainant entered a last chance agreement with the agency that provided she would be removed if she tested positive for drugs or alcohol while on duty. She was subsequently observed by a supervisor appearing red and glassy-eyed and unsteady on her feet and sent for testing. She tested positive for alcohol and marijuana and was removed. The Commission had little difficulty upholding the summary judgment decision of the administrative judge, noting that she did not contend that she was not under the influence of alcohol and drugs on the day in question.</p>
