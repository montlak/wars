<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-95"><span class="space">h.</span> Complainant's Duty to Take Advantage of Corrective Opportunities</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, the Supreme Court stressed the employee's obligation to avoid harm by reporting suspected harassment through employer-provided avenues and the employer's obligation to correct and prevent harassment when brought to its attention. Neither case involved harassment by coworkers, nor did either directly address the Commission's prompt remedial action requirement. However, <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> are consistent with that requirement and, in fact, suggest the requirement extends to hostile environment harassment when the perpetrator is a supervisor or manager. The thrust of the affirmative defense on the issue of liability is that an employer can avoid liability for sexual harassment where it has responded to such harassment in a timely and effective manner. Where the agency promptly investigated the complainant's claims of sexual harassment, assigned her to a new female supervisor, offered to move her office and made follow up inquiries with the complainant, these actions were sufficient for the agency to establish an affirmative defense to supervisory harassment. In <span class="Italic">Bernstein v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120072322 (2007), the complainant was sexually harassed by two supervisors. One supervisor made sexual "comments under his breath, grab[bed] his crotch, look[ed] down complainant's blouse, lick[ed] his lips and ogle[d] her." A second supervisor would rub his arm against the complainant's breasts and also made sexual comments to her.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had very little difficulty finding that the conduct was unwelcome, was based on sex, and was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. However, the Commission found that the agency had sustained its burden of demonstrating both prongs of the affirmative defense to supervisory harassment-that the agency took prompt and effective action to correct the harassing behavior, and that complainant had unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventative opportunities. After finding that the agency had an anti-harassment policy that conformed with EEOC guidelines, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bernstein</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he record indicates that the agency took prompt action to prevent and correct the harassing behavior. In complainant's affidavit she states that in January 2004, she told the Director that S1 was sexually harassing female employees. While upset that the Director mentioned her name, she acknowledged that S1 was thereafter required to have a female supervisor present when speaking with complainant. According to complainant, it was over a year later that she "decided [she] was fed-up with this sort of harassment" and spoke with the new Director about the harassment. Complainant herself attested that she was assigned to a new supervisor and offered a move to another complex. Although she did not know what her co-workers said, complainant also noted that "[the Director] actually spoke with a few of the employees after I raised the issue to him." Therefore, we find that the agency has established the first prong of the defense. <span class="Italic">See generally Mattheis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A23647 (November 12, 2003) (Commission concluded that agency met the first prong of defense when: management recommended that complainant's claim be investigated, the alleged harasser was immediately placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, and management conducted interviews.); <span class="Italic">Seth v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01 Al 1289 (September 9, 2002) (AJ correctly concluded that first prong was established by evidence that the agency had a specific policy which was shared in trainings as well as many "stand-up" talks to employees regarding inappropriate behavior. There was also evidence that a special team to investigate sexual harassment charges was in place).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second prong, the Commission agrees that complainant failed to take advantage of the preventive opportunities provided by the Director. For example, in response to her first reports of harassment in January 2004, the Director required that a female supervisor be present during S1's conversations with complainant. Complainant, however, attested that I did not want to have our future conversations in front of [the female supervisor]." She explained that she had "some very personal discussions" with S1 and "did not want to have to share those matters in [the female supervisor's] presence."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Director attested that after learning in July 2005 about the alleged actions by S1 and S2, he would speak to complainant briefly to provide her the opportunity to advise him of additional problems. She did not raise any concerns with him. According to the Director, he asked complainant on at least two occasions if there were any problems. The Director stated that complainant did not mention that sitting outside S2's office upset her, when she reported the harassment to him. When they did talk about possibly moving her, the Director attested that complainant said it was unnecessary because the entire office relocation was approaching. Similarly, complainant herself attested that, in response to one of the Director's follow-up inquiries in November 2005, she told him that she was unhappy with her close proximity to S2's office. Complainant stated that the Director offered to move her then, but "I told him it made no sense since my wedding and honeymoon were so close" and she would be returning "in time for the scheduled relocation of the entire staff." Upon her return, the office relocation was postponed, and the Director asked again if complainant wanted to move. When she indicated that she would, she was relocated the following day. Consequently, we find that the agency has established its affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Coley v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120062109 (2008), the Commission found its administrative judge erred in granting summary judgment to the agency where it delayed some three weeks before starting an investigation into the complainant's sexual harassment claim. In addition to noting that the supervisor denied the conduct and there was a dispute of material fact over the harassment itself, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Coley</span>, found that the agency had been less than prompt in investigation the complainant's claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The analysis now moves to the agency's affirmative defense. Here the AJ found that complainant failed to report the harassment, and when the agency was notified of the harassment it took prompt and effective remedial action. It is undisputed that the agency had a sexual harassment policy, posted and disseminated the policy, and trained S1 and complainant on sexual harassment in 2004. However, the record reveals that complainant contacted an EEO Counselor two weeks after the first incident of alleged harassment and less than one week after the last incident. We do not find that this delay was unreasonable, especially since S1 allegedly threatened to fire complainant if she got "on his nerves." Further, the record reflects that it took the agency almost three weeks to begin its investigation after the EEO Counselor was notified. Given the severity of complainant's allegations, specifically the physical touching, the agency should have taken immediate measures to correct the harassment. <span class="Italic">See Velez v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902746 (November 16, 1990) (an agency should not wait for a finding of harassment prior to taking preventative and remedial actions). Complainant alleged that the harassment did not end when she notified the EEO Counselor; S1 contacted her and harassed her after she reported the harassment to the agency. We find the agency has not thus far provided any evidence that it took prompt action to stop the harassment and prevent future harassment. Therefore, we find a fact finder could find in favor of complainant, and a hearing is necessary to assess the credibility of the witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where the agency takes prompt and effective action, the defense may fail where the aggrieved employee avails herself of the preventive and corrective opportunities provided by the agency. In <span class="Italic">Scarlet M. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120150940 (2016), a female employee found a monitor in her supervisor's office with images of the women's bathroom on it. She reported the incident to the agency, and within days, the agency and FBI launched an investigation, finding that the supervisor had installed a hidden camera in the women's bathroom. The agency placed the supervisor on administrative leave and barred him from the building and from contacting the aggrieved employees. He ultimately retired. The agency met with the affected employees to inform them of the corrective action taken and to offer counseling. The Commission, <span id="Page_880"></span>in <span class="Italic">Scarlet M</span>., found that the agency satisfied its obligation to take prompt action, but it wasn't enough to avoid liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that that it avoids liability for the actions of the Director because it had an anti-harassment policy and procedure in place, and once it was informed of the Director's conduct, it took prompt action to correct the actions of the Director. Even accepting this as correct, however, only establishes the first prong of the test described above for the Agency's affirmative defense. We determine, for the reasons stated below, that the Agency failed to establish the second prong of its affirmative defense. The second prong of the affirmative defense requires a showing by the employer that the aggrieved employee "unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2293; <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2270. The burden lies with the employer to prove that the employee's failure to complain was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC No, 915.002 (June 18, 1999). In the case at hand, the harm began as soon as the Director placed the camera in the women's bathroom, which occurred at least a month before it was discovered on August 14, 2013. Within hours that same evening, the Base Security was informed of the camera in the bathroom. As such, we cannot find that the affected employees unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In some circumstances, such as the one at issue, unlawful harassment will occur and harm will result despite the exercise of requisite legal care by the employer and employee. For example, if an employee's supervisor directed frequent, egregious racial epithets at him that caused emotional harm virtually from the outset, and the employee promptly complained, corrective action by the employer could prevent further harm but might not correct the actionable harm that the employee already had suffered. In these circumstances, the employer will be liable because the defense requires proof that it exercised reasonable legal care and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid the harm. While a notice-based negligence standard would absolve the employer of liability, the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 118 S. Ct. 2257 (1998) and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 118 S. Ct. 2275 (1998) does not. As the Court explained, vicarious liability sets a "more stringent standard" for the employer than the "minimum standard" of negligence theory. <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2267.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this result may seem harsh to a law abiding employer, it is consistent with liability standards under the anti-discrimination statutes which generally make employers responsible for the discriminatory acts of their supervisors. If, for example, a supervisor rejects a candidate for promotion because of national origin-based bias, the employer will be liable regardless of whether the employee complained to higher management and regardless of whether higher management had any knowledge about the supervisor's motivation. Harassment is the only type of discrimination carried out by a supervisor for which an employer can avoid liability, and that limitation must be construed narrowly. The employer will be shielded from liability for harassment by a supervisor only if it proves that it exercised reasonable care in preventing and correcting the harassment and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid all of the harm. If both parties exercise reasonable care, the defense will fail. <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999); <span class="Italic">see also Complainant v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111865 (July 9, 2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the Director was the highest ranking Agency official at the McAlester facility. On occasion, the Commission has recognized the "alter ego" theory of liability in a harassment case where the harasser is of sufficiently high rank to be treated as the Agency's proxy, resulting in his conduct being directly imputed to the Agency. <span class="Italic">See Sebek v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00005 (March 8, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because the Agency cannot establish its affirmative defense, we find that it is liable for the harassing conduct of the Director of Complainant 1, Complainant 2, and Complainant 3 sufficient to create a hostile and offensive work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant has received sexual harassment training and fails to report alleged harassment, combined with prompt action once the allegation was made, can absolve an agency from liability. As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Ebony M. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120132209 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that it should avoid liability here because (1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior; and (2) Complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventative or corrective opportunities that the employer provided. We agree with the Agency's position, Here, it is undisputed that the Agency had a policy against sexual harassment, provided training to its employees, and communicated to all employees, including Complainant, the ways to report such conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although she received formal training regarding the EEO process four times during her tenure with the Agency, Complainant failed to take advantage of these preventative measures. She did not notify anyone of S1's conduct until after she was notified that her removal was being proposed. Further, as described above, the Agency took immediate action upon learning of Complainant's allegations of sexual harassment to prevent any subsequent acts. The Agency separated Complainant and S1, started an investigation, suspended S1 without pay and subsequently terminated S1 for his actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, with respect to Complainant's contention on appeal that she failed the SOPA examinations because of the stress that she was under as a result of S1's harassment, we clearly sympathize with Complainant, but simply find no support for this contention in the record. As indicated above, Complainant did not show that S1 was present in her vicinity while she was studying for the SOPA because they had very limited contact during this time, and did not work together at all during the period in which she took and failed the three SOPA tests. Accordingly, we find that the preponderance of the evidence of record does not establish that discrimination occurred with regard to Complainant's removal or that the Agency should be held liable for S1's actions.</p>
