<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-106"><span class="space">1.</span> Good Faith Exception</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, an agency is not liable for compensatory damages in a case under the Rehabilitation Act where it engaged in good faith efforts, in consultation with the complainant, at reasonable accommodation but fell short of what is legally required. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 1981a(a)(3). However, the agency must still grant relief to such a complainant in the form of reasonable accommodation and any other make-whole relief to which the complainant is entitled.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mitchel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953287 (1996), the Commission easily decided the agency had not shown a good faith effort when it only could demonstrate a cursory attempt to find the complainant another position. Finding that the complainant was entitled to an award of compensatory damages, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Mitchel</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Commission finds that the agency has failed to meet its burden of establishing that accommodating appellant for the period from September 25, 1993 to November 8, 1993 would have resulted in an undue hardship. Although appellant's supervisor testified that he unsuccessfully attempted to find another position for appellant by calling the supervisor of the two areas where appellant was qualified to work, there is no evidence in the record to document this. The Commission agrees with appellant that at most a cursory, perfunctory attempt to find appellant work was made. There is no evidence that the agency fully assessed appellant's medical condition, her job skills, the work environment, and the resources of the agency to make a determination of whether appellant could be reasonably accommodated. Appellant claims that there were other jobs available during this time period that she was qualified to perform. Specifically, appellant claims that there were transitional employees who were performing the job that she was removed from after her removal. Although the agency argues that the work load diminished during this time period, it provides no evidence to substantiate this assertion. The record reflects that appellant's claim is corroborated by the testimony of a coworker who stated that there was just as much damaged mail in the automation unit as before. Moreover, the agency has provided no evidence to establish that other positions were not available on other tours within the building.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, appellant also stated that transitional employees were performing work in the Primary Unit that she had performed in the past, that she could easily have done. She testified that she performed this work for two years and that she was complimented on her productivity during this time. Other than her supervisor's assertions, which we have found to be inadequate, the agency provided no evidence to refute appellant's claim that work was available within her restrictions in this unit. In addition, although the agency argues that appellant was not qualified to perform these duties, the agency provides no evidence to support their position, and it is the burden of the agency to submit such evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the agency has discriminated against appellant on the basis of her disability by failing to show that a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate appellant was made. Thus, the agency is ordered to remedy the discrimination, including awarding compensatory damages, in accordance with the order below. The Commission notes that appellant filed a grievance on this matter and received payment for four hours straight time per day for September 25, 1993 through October 30, 1993 as part of her settlement. As such, her back pay award must be offset by this amount. Finally, the Commission notes that although appellant does not elaborate on her claim for compensatory damages that she made in her complaint, she is entitled to have this claim considered in accordance with the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Luellen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951340 (1996), the Commission found the complainant was not entitled to an award of compensatory damages because the agency engaged in a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant. The complainant in that case had a hearing impairment which necessitated that noise be kept below a certain level. Although the agency provided modifications to reduce the complainant's exposure to noise, it never actually measured noise in the facility to determine whether it was above or below the proper level. Still, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Luellen</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the relief to which appellant is entitled. Where discrimination is found, the injured party is to be placed, as near as may be, in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed<span class="Italic">. Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975). This would include backpay for all periods he did not work due to not being reasonably accommodated, and reimbursement of leave used for the same reason.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that he is entitled to compensatory damages for emotional distress. Under &#x00A7; 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), compensatory damages may be awarded for pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. We note, however, that &#x00A7; 102 of the CRA also provides that an agency is not liable for compensatory damages in cases of disability discrimination where it demonstrates that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1800"></span>Regarding the question of compensatory damages, we agree with the AJ's finding. The agency consulted appellant, Physician-1, and A-3, in order to identify a position that was within appellant's medical limitations. Because of the agency's efforts, appellant was able to work in the Store from May 1992 until October 1992. Upon reassigning appellant, the agency made various modifications to Room M-10 that were designed to further accommodate him in the position. For the reasons stated above, we find that the agency's efforts, although not sufficient to afford appellant a reasonable accommodation, demonstrate that the agency made a good faith effort to accommodate appellant. Consequently, appellant is not entitled to receive compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the Commission found that the agency engaged in good faith efforts in <span class="Italic">Luellen</span>, it still has not articulated a test or standard for evaluating whether an effort meets the good faith criterion. Instead, it has tended to define the good faith exception in terms of the minimal actions an agency must take. For example, in <span class="Italic">Burnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50816 (2005), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether the agency acted in good faith, we look for evidence that the agency engaged in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01 A33341 (July 22, 2004).<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship</span> at 12, fn. 24 (Revised 10/17/02). In <span class="Italic">Ferguson,</span> the agency engaged in the interactive process by requesting medical documentation, but failed to take any steps towards providing a reasonable accommodation. The Commission has found a lack of good faith where the agency performed no search for an accommodation. <span class="Italic">Mees v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971964 (September 11, 2000). In this case, the record reflects that after receiving a letter from complainant's physician in 1994 that complainant could not return to her letter sorting position, the agency's Plant Manager (PM) failed or refused to consider reassignment. Instead the agency's only apparent response was that she should apply for disability retirement. ROI Vol. 1 Exh A-12, A-18 and A-21. Complainant confirmed that when she requested a permanent light duty position, no meetings were held and she was told there was nothing available. Tr. 67, 121.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Holton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991307 (2002), the Commission found that the agency met the good faith exception to a damages award where it failed to accommodate the complainant for one meeting by not providing an interpreter, but had provided an interpreter on other occasions. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Rathore v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120114330 (2013), the Commission found that providing the complainant with an interpreter for some meetings did not constitute a good faith defense for those meetings where it failed to provide an interpreter.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Kyle S. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2019005694 (2021), the Commission considered the complainant's eventual frustration and refusal to engage in the interactive process to find good faith on the part of the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Agency appeals the AJ's award of $200,000 for Complainant's non-pecuniary losses. The Agency stated that Complainant is not entitled to compensatory damages because it acted in good faith to provide Complainant reasonable accommodation. The Agency stated that it engaged in the interactive process with Complainant and, at some point, he became upset and refused to participate in the interactive process. Further, the Agency stated that Complainant failed to establish a nexus between his emotional distress and other mental health conditions with the Agency's adverse actions. The Agency stated that Complainant's emotional harm was due to uncertainty from his neurological condition (fear that it would be life-long and he would be bound to a wheelchair), and Complainant sought mental health care more than a year after his termination solely for the purpose of this litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency stated that LPC1's testimony was not credible as she admitted that she did not take into consideration the uncertainty of Complainant's neurological condition in her assessments. The Agency stated that the AJ's award was "monstrously excessive" and not consistent with similar cases. The Agency stated, if compensatory damages are warranted, they should be no more than $10,000 considering that Complainant's primary concern was the uncertainty of his neurological condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation, compensatory damages may be awarded if the Agency fails to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the individual with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3); <span class="italic">Gunn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053293 (June 15, 2007). While we have concerns regarding the Agency's managerial confusion in handling the instant matter, we are not inclined to find that the Agency acted in bad faith, as the record clearly shows that the Agency sought to assist Complainant with various options for his absences, at least until Complainant told the RA Specialist to leave him alone. Complainant asserted that he was consumed with handling his medical testing and found the contact by various Agency people "extremely confusing." Based on our finding that the Agency engaged in the interactive process in good faith, we find Complainant is not entitled to compensatory damages for denial of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Damiano v. Postmaster General</span>, 05980311 (1999), the Commission found the agency liable for compensatory damages due to its lack of good faith in failing to provide the complainant with an American Sign Language interpreter, as the agency agreed to do in order that the complainant could communicate with his supervisor and the shop steward:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the agency's arguments to be without merit. Appellant, who is unable to communicate verbally and has limited ability to communicate in writing, clearly was harmed by the failure of the agency to provide the promised access to ASL interpreters. Although appellant ultimately may have been able to discuss his concerns with a steward and his supervisor, the agency's failure to provide the agreed upon accommodation prevented appellant from resolving his concerns with the same expediency as non-deaf employees. Further, the agency's failure to provide an accommodation it had already agreed to provide plainly evidences lack of good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency may be found to have engaged in a good faith effort where the complainant refuses to cooperate in accommodation efforts. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132250 (2015), the Commission found that the complainant was not entitled to damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation, damages may be awarded if the Agency fails to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the individual with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3). An agency can demonstrate that it made a good faith effort by proving that, in consultation with the complainant, it attempted to identify and make a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Guilbeaux v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720050094 (Aug. 6, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, Complainant's supervisor asked him to stop casing mail because there was no reasonable accommodation on file. Complainant asserts that he submitted medical documentation on March 16, 2008 outlining his medical restrictions and was allowed to case mail until June 19, 2012 when his immediate supervisor asked him to stop. Complainant explained to the supervisor that he had been working with the accommodation since 2008, however, the supervisor asked him to stop working within his restrictions immediately so that he could investigate whether Complainant had a reasonable accommodation on file. Complainant was told that he could use sick leave or annual leave to cover the remainder of his shift on June 19, 2012 if he could not perform the job. Complainant's supervisor investigated the matter and concluded that there was no reasonable accommodation on file for Complainant from 2008. Complainant's supervisor contacted a former supervisor, and other individuals in reaching this conclusion. Complainant was thereafter prohibited from casing mail prior to delivering it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, even though Complainant requested an accommodation in 2008, the record demonstrates that Complainant did not complete the process. The current DRAC chairperson testified regarding Complainant's 2008 request for reasonable accommodation, that "a meeting was scheduled" and "DRAC sent him a second request for medical documentation," however, DRAC did not recommend or approve the request. (ROI, p. 165). Management indicated that Complainant did not complete the DRAC process in 2008. Correspondence from the DRAC in 2008 indicates that DRAC requested additional medical information from Complainant stating that they would not be able to complete consideration without the documents. No other information appears in the file on this issue, but Complainant does indicate that the DRAC did not provide him with an accommodation in 2008. It appears that Complainant was working within his medical restrictions despite not completing the DRAC process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, since there was no reasonable accommodation on file from 2008, Complainant's immediate supervisor informed Complainant that he would have to again submit his request for accommodation to the DRAC. The record indicates that the immediate supervisor looked for light duty assignments for Complainant while the DRAC request was pending. Complainant was provided with some light duty assignments; however, the supervisor was unsuccessful in finding full-time light duty work. Finally, the DRAC considered Complainant's 2012 request, but denied the request stating that Complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability and cannot perform the essential functions of the Carrier position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the series of events does not indicate bad faith on the part of the Agency to identify and provide an accommodation to the Complainant, even though there is not enough evidence to support the Agency's determination that Complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability. Complainant is not entitled to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Teshima v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961997 (1998), the Commission found the agency made a good faith accommodation effort where it assigned the employee to a light-duty position but failed to inform his supervisors of his work restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent">But not every effort at accommodation will be considered a good faith effort by the Commission. In <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Secretary of Veterans Administration</span>, <span id="Page_1801"></span>01966861 (1998), the Commission rejected the agency's good faith defense to compensatory damages because its accommodation efforts did not allow the complainant to function "autonomously and that such conditions robbed appellant of privileges and benefits of employment equal to those enjoyed by non-disabled individuals." Specifically, the agency had not made adequate efforts to provide audio forms of manuals needed for a blind employee to properly advise veterans of their rights and benefits--the sole function of his position. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Burchfield v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01970152 (2000) (agency failed to inform complainant that bathrooms at the training facility were not accessible).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where the agency has made significant efforts to provide accommodation, a good faith defense will fail if the agency has failed to make any effort on one aspect of accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Tate v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A24423.txt">01A24423</a> (2004), the Commission found that the agency had not engaged in a good faith accommodation effort where it had provided a sedentary work assignment that met the complainant's medical restrictions, but failed to make any effort to provide a lumbar chair. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Tate</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to protection under the Rehabilitation Act. The record reflects that complainant is subject to a 10-pound lifting restriction, and that complainant is able to perform the duties of her Modified Clerk position with reasonable accommodation. Complainant therefore is a "qualified individual with a disability" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.<span class="Italic"> See Selix v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that when complainant returned to work September 8, 2001, her physician advised the agency that complainant could return to work with restrictions of no lifting more than 10 pounds; no pushing or pulling more than 5 pounds; no climbing, kneeling, bending, stooping, or twisting; standing and walking no more than 30 minutes per hour; and reaching above the shoulder no more than one hour per day. Complainant's physician also advised the agency that complainant "needs to have back support on chair." The physician subsequently clarified that complainant required a "lumbar chair with armrest." The record reflects that complainant was provided with a sedentary work assignment which met her restrictions, except for the requested chair.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that complainant was provided with a "back supported chair," <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> a chair with a back, contending that "any back supported chair" is a "lumbar chair." However, complainant has provided a detailed account, unrebutted by the agency, explaining how she was made by management to locate a chair suitable for her use on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis, and how on at least one occasion, the chair she located was taken away from her and given to another employee. Complainant further states that she was advised that a special chair had been ordered for her, but it was never provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency must make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified disabled employee, unless the agency can demonstrate that accommodation would work an undue hardship on its operations. 29 C.F.R. 1614.203(c);<span class="Italic"> see McCullough v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950539 (April 25, 1996). The Commission notes in this regard that an agency is not required to provide a disabled employee with every desired accommodation. <span class="Italic">Belser v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03900064 (July 6, 1990). The employee must show a nexus between the disabling condition and the requested accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Wiggins v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953715 (April 22, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant requested, via a note from her physician, a "lumbar chair with arm rest" to accommodate the disabling effects of an injury affecting her leg, knee, hip, back, and neck. The agency was aware of complainant's limitations and of the need for accommodation, but neither provided the requested chair nor established a defense to doing so, e.g., that providing the chair would entail undue hardship. The Commission therefore finds that the agency failed to provide complainant with reasonable accommodation. Further, because it appears that the agency did not make a good faith effort to provide complainant with reasonable accommodation, complainant may be entitled to compensatory damages.<span class="Italic"> See Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996211 (June 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33341.txt">01A33341</a> (2004), where the agency engaged in the interactive process by requesting medical documentation, but never attempted to secure an accommodation for the complainant. "An agency cannot be deemed to have acted in good faith where it has not at least attempted to secure an accommodation for an employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">But even some attempt at accommodation may not support a good faith effort if that attempt fails and the agency does nothing more. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bowers v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720070012 (2010), where the agency denied the complainant's request for reassignment to a vacant position with less typing and instead insisted she try a one-handed keyboard for a 30-day period, the Commission found that the agency did not act in good faith:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that while complainant may have expressed doubts about the efficacy of the one-handed keyboard, it was not unreasonable for the agency to require her to give the keyboard a trial period. However, once it became apparent that the one-handed keyboard was not an effective accommodation, the agency was obligated to pursue other means of accommodating complainant. The agency not only failed to do so, but affirmatively ceased pursuit of a known effective accommodation, i.e., reassignment to the vacant Privacy Act Specialist position. Accordingly, we find that the agency did not act in good faith, and therefore is liable for compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Petted v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120090266 (2011), the Commission found that the agency had not made a good faith effort at accommodation where the complainant demonstrated that comparable reassignment vacancies existed at the WG-11 level, but the agency reassigned him to a GS-6 clerical position.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Manjarres v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120064538 (2008), the Commission found that the agency had engaged in good faith efforts to accommodate the complainant where it restricted a search for a reassignment position to the regional office. The Commission noted that the agency had provided past accommodations and when the complainant could no longer perform the essential functions of her position even with accommodation, it conducted the reassignment search. The fact that the search was restricted to the regional office and not properly expanded to other offices did not preclude a good faith defense on damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Layman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120063523 (2009), the Commission found that the agency engaged in a good faith effort at providing accommodation where it granted the complainant a requested schedule change, but did not grant his request for a handicapped parking space. The complainant requested a shift change from 8:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 4:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> to 7:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 3:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> and a parking space. The agency initially granted a shift change from 7:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 4:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> It then requested further medical information, which the complainant resisted for a time. Apparently, the reason the complainant was requesting the shift change was to assure he could find a handicapped parking space. Although the Commission found that the failure to provide the space was a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, it also found that the complainant was not entitled to compensatory damages because of the agency's good faith effort at accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="italic">Eleni M. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020001903 (2021), did not establish a good faith effort to provide reasonable accommodations where it terminated the interactive process while the complainant was on leave:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission previously found that an agency lacked good faith when responding to a reasonable accommodation request where the agency used the complainant's leave status as an excuse to halt the interactive process. <span class="italic">See Denese G. v. Dep't of the Treas</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016). Another indication of a lack of "good faith" effort occurs where an Agency's inaction in response to a request for a reasonable accommodation, forces a complainant to take leave for a significant period time, which they would not have had to do if the Agency made a reasonable accommodation available to them. <span class="italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record does not reflect that the Agency acted in good faith when responding to Complainant's requests for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation. S1 made efforts to engage in the interactive process for both of Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests, including following up and arranging a meeting with the RA Manager. She also partially granted Complainant's November 21, 2016 request by providing him with a laptop in order to telework as a reasonable accommodation. Yet, there is no evidence that S1 made any meaningful attempt to secure a reasonable accommodation for Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lack of good faith is evinced by S1's improper disability-related inquiries including her <span class="italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act, and, in particular, S1's refusal to proceed with Complainant's second request unless Complainant provided her with a completed AR 690-12 Appendix C. Under the circumstances, it was not necessary for Complainant to submit this particular document, and it should not have been a barrier to Complainant obtaining a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant already submitted a reasonable accommodation request and provided S1 with ample up to date supporting medical documentation confirming her need for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation, specifically, Dragon Software upon her return to work. The AR 690-12 Appendix C is a list of questions to be used as a tool for engaging in the interactive process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency explains that it requires this document in accordance with its internal policies, failure to complete a form is not necessarily a valid reason to delay providing a reasonable accommodation. In her testimony, S1 appears to conflate the AR 690-12 Appendix C with the interactive process itself. Similarly, a December 2016 email to S1, around the time of her surgery, Complainant indicates that she had not completed her CAP form. Complainant's November 21, 2016 request and accompanying documentation identified all of the necessary information, including the specific assistive technology Complainant sought. The form is also not <span id="Page_1802"></span>required under Agency policy. AR 690-12, Appendix D states that in order to obtain an assistive technology through CAP, an employee must "confirm request in writing, preferably by completing the CAP Request Form." (Emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not shown the Agency to be liable for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to the extent that she alleges that on or about July 14, 2018, S1 failed to notify her that her assistive technology arrived from CAP. Complainant reasons that S1 knew that she took FMLA leave because typing without an accommodation harmed her fingers and wrist. S1 was also aware that with assistive technology, Complainant and could have worked with minimal use of her right hand and wrist had she been allowed to return from FMLA. Complainant argues that her August requests to come into work were denied for similar reasons. However, Complainant was on notice that her assistive technology was scheduled to be delivered from CAP around this time, she received emails informing her when it was shipped and when it was delivered, and she did not notify S1. Regardless, Complainant has not shown that S1 would have known to contact her while she was on leave because it was not clear whether Complainant still needed to stay on FMLA leave to care for her mother, whose condition worsened in recent months. Further, Complainant did not call or email her office to inquire whether the assistive technology arrived or ask about it when she contacted the Agency in August 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that an unnecessary delay in providing an effective reasonable accommodation can indicate bad faith and result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. EEOC Guidance No. 915.002 at Q. 10, <span class="italic">Yessenia H. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070027 (Oct. 13, 2015). In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for the delay; (2) the length of the delay; (3) how much the individual with a disability and the agency each contributed to the delay; (4) what the agency was doing during the delay; and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide. <span class="italic">Id</span>. at n.38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency created several months-long unnecessary delays, beginning on November 30, 2016, when S1 first notified Complainant that she would not act on his accommodation request until Complainant returned to work with updated medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The delay was unnecessary because Complainant already provided sufficient documentation to support her request. Regardless, Complainant submitted the December 7, 2016 medical documentation and demonstrated a continued effort to obtain more (unnecessary) documentation for S1. The unnecessary delay prevented Complainant from efficiently teleworking, despite S1 promptly providing her with a laptop. <span class="italic">See, e.g. Patricia W. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172637 (Mar. 26, 2019) (agency caused an unnecessary delay where the complainant was provided a reasonable accommodation of full time telework, but it took four months to provide the necessary technical equipment, software, and training). With the exception of December 19 and 20, 2016, S1, after consulting the RA Manager decided to take no further action until Complainant returned to work, with updated medical documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 reasoned that that after surgery and intensive occupational therapy, Complainant may no longer need a reasonable accommodation when she returned. <span class="italic">See Clayton C. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120120350 (Nov. 17, 2015) (finding that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process, and rejecting agency's explanation that the complainant's initial request for a reasonable accommodation "expired," given that the complainant's disability was obvious and there was no evidence that the need for the accommodation had been eliminated). S1's reasoning ignores that Complainant's requests for an accommodation were also intended so that she could telework during her recovery (i.e. prior to returning to work). S1 does not acknowledge that the December 7, 2016 physician's note Complainant provided addresses this uncertainty by providing a timeline of her recovery that indicated Complainant would require assistive technology through March 31, 2017. As previously discussed, the record contradicts S1's alternate reason that Complainant withdrew her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 prolonged the unnecessary delay, even when Complainant's February 23, 2017 documentation confirmed that she still had the same limitation, her condition was chronic (so her initial accommodation request from November 21, 2016 was still valid), and she required Dragon Software as a reasonable accommodation. without a reasonable accommodation. By this point, it was definitely foreseeable that the unnecessary delay in obtaining assistive technology would result in Complainant missing work due to flareups of her condition arising from efforts to work without an accommodation. S1 continued not to act despite receiving Complainant's March 20, and 27, 2016 medical documents and upon Complainant's March 20, 2016 return to the office with an obvious disability. S1 attributed her delay in providing Complainant with a reasonable accommodation to Complainant's failure to fully respond to (improper) disability-related inquiries, and insisting that no further action could be taken until Complainant engaged in the interactive process by completing an AR 690-12 Appendix C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant and the Agency both contributed to the delay in providing reasonable accommodations, however the Agency did so to a much greater extent and to the detriment of its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="italic">See Ruben T. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120171405 (Mar. 22, 2019) (in determining that the agency was responsible for the unnecessary delay in providing the complainant a reasonable accommodation, the Commission considered that complainant was proactive, and the agency ceased its efforts to provide an accommodation when he was temporarily placed on another assignment, and there was "nothing in the record showing that he withdrew or paused his request for the additional software"). Complainant could have been clearer in her December 6, 2016 response email to S1, who interpreted it as a withdrawal of her complaint. However, as previously discussed, S1 should not have ceased her efforts to obtain a reasonable accommodation for Complainant before or after Complainant's email, given the December 7, 2016 medical documents. The record supports that S1 reached out to Complainant multiple times in March, April and May 2017 to obtain the completed AR 690-12 Appendix C. While it is not clear why Complainant failed to provide this document, it is not a sufficient reason to withhold a reasonable accommodation, given that she already provided a reasonable accommodation request and supporting medical documents. S1 also had opportunities to complete the document together with Complainant when they met to discuss accommodations. CAP appears to have been responsive when Complainant contacted them independently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The assistive technology Complainant requested as a reasonable accommodation was simple to provide because it was available through CAP. According to Section 1.3 of the Agency's "Procedures for Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities" the Agency's purpose in establishing CAP was to make assistive technology available to employees that needed it, and not cost individual offices or departments (contrary to S1's assertion). In both verbal and written communications to S1, including the November 21, 2016 reasonable accommodation request, Complainant provided the specific items of assistive technology she believed would make an effective reasonable accommodation. S1 needed only to submit a request through CAP. Appendix D-2 of AR 690-12 provides clear information about how to request assistive technology through CAP, and CAP is identified as a resource in other portions of AR-690-12. That Complainant could obtain the assistive technology independently underscores how obtaining her reasonable accommodation was not a complex process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude the Agency's excessive delay in responding to Complainant's request for reasonable accommodation was in bad faith, entitling her to consideration of an award for compensatory damages.</p>
