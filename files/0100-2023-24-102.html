<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-83"><span class="space">5.</span> Interpreters</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Holton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991307 (2002), the Commission gave a good synopsis of when an agency is responsible for providing an interpreter as an accommodation and when it is not required to do so:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations define a reasonable accommodation to be, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> a modification or adjustment that enables a disabled employee to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(o)(iii). It is unlawful for the agency not to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified disabled employee unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.9(a). Under the Rehabilitation Act, the agency's obligation to reasonably accommodate hearing impaired employees includes providing effective interpreter services during work-related activities where hearing impaired employees are expected to be present<span class="Italic">. See Ortiz v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960270 (October 16, 1998). The Commission has held that for a severely hearing impaired employee who can sign, reasonable accommodation, at a minimum, requires providing an interpreter for safety talks, discussions on work procedures, policies or assignments, and for every disciplinary action so that the employee can understand what is occurring at any and every crucial time in his employment career, whether or not he asks for an interpreter<span class="Italic">. See Feris v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934828 (August 10, 1995), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950936 (July 19, 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Bradley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920167 (March 26, 1992); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05880750 (April 18, 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD concluded that the agency did not deprive complainant of a reasonable accommodation when it failed to provide interpreter services for the DPS meeting. The FAD found that an interpreter was not necessary since the meeting was expected to last no longer than fifteen minutes and an interpreter was unavailable on such short notice. We disagree with the FAD's conclusions and find, for the following reasons, that the agency discriminated against complainant by denying him the services of an interpreter for the DPS meeting. The Commission has held that meetings and discussions involving discussions on work procedures, policies or assignments require the services of an interpreter as a reasonable accommodation for hearing impaired individuals<span class="Italic">. See Feris,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. While the agency argued that it attempted to contract the services of an interpreter, it provided no corroborating evidence that one could not be obtained within one week's notice. In addition, there is no explanation in the record as to why the meeting could not be rescheduled until an interpreter could be obtained. The agency cannot escape its obligation to provide complainant a reasonable accommodation simply because of the difficulty of scheduling interpreter services in a timely manner. The Commission finds no evidence in the record to support a finding that providing interpreter services would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial or disruptive or that would fundamentally alter the nature of the agency's operation.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(p). In addition, the agency argues that complainant and the agency agreed that an interpreter would not be necessary for short meetings. However, since S2 had oriGINAlly arranged for an interpreter for the meeting, the agency cannot plausibly contend that it was unaware of the realistic possibility that the meeting would last longer than 15 minutes and would therefore require an interpreter. Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to meet its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to supply an interpreter at the DPS meeting on September 8, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Discussion in S1's office</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the discussion between complainant, S1 and S2 in S1's office, we find that it would have posed an undue hardship on the agency to refrain from immediately addressing a highly disruptive situation whereby complainant had engaged in slamming down a crate and remained very agitated and combative in the workplace despite management's attempts to calm him down. The record indicates that allowing complainant to remain at the facility until a sign language interpreter could be obtained would have caused undue disruption to the operations of the postal facility.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(p)(2). Accordingly, we find no violation of the Rehabilitation Act with respect to this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Non-TDD telephone call to complainant's wife</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to S1 and S2 calling complainant on his home phone and paging him, we find no violation of the Rehabilitation Act. First, the evidence indicates that the agency attempted to contact complainant through his pager, which was specially provided to him to accommodate his hearing impairment. While management eventually contacted complainant's wife through a non-TDD phone line, we find that a message from the agency to complainant was nevertheless effectively completed through complainant's wife. Since there is no evidence that the method of communication was ineffective or that complainant specifically requested that he be contacted on his TDD telephone line, we find no violation of the Rehabilitation Act with respect to this issue<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disability Act</span>, No. 915.002, (March 1, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Use of a multi-user TDD telephone line</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the agency's utilization of a multi-user TDD telephone line, since there is no evidence in the record that this line was not an effective means of communication or that complainant even requested a single-user line, we cannot conclude that the Rehabilitation Act was violated with respect to this issue. We note that complainant's job duties did not include any telephone usage. The record shows that complainant used the telephone for an occasional personal call and for union activity. The Rehabilitation Act requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations so that employees with disabilities can enjoy the "benefits and privileges of employment" equal to those enjoyed by similarly situated employees without disabilities. The record does not support the finding that complainant's access to the telephone for personal use was unequal as compared to his fellow letter carriers<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disability Act</span>, No. 915.002, pp. 8-9 (March 1, 1999). Accordingly, we find no violation of the Rehabilitation Act when the agency failed to provide a single-user TDD telephone line for complainant's use.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Haggard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12221 (2003), the Commission found that the agency failed to make reasonable accommodation when it did not show a safety video to hearing-impaired employees in a timely manner, but did not fail to make reasonable accommodation when it did not provide an interpreter for an awards ceremony. The Commission found the awards ceremony "was not a crucial time in the complainant's career,..." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Haggard</span> case came back to the Commission on a petition for enforcement and it found that the agency had violated both the Rehabilitation Act and its previous remedial order in the case. In <span class="Italic">Haggard v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120060330 (2007), the complainant alleged a failure to accommodate and violation of the previous order when at two meetings the agency used a coworker who could finger spell and had some knowledge of sign language as an interpreter. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Haggard</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD found that the agency provided complainant with a qualified sign language interpreter for the August 4, 2004 and September 14, 2004 meetings. We disagree. Complainant's contention that he did not understand the communications at the meetings is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Co-worker 1 stated that she is able to finger spell sign and knows several signs because she has an aunt who is deaf. Based on this evidence, it is more probable than not that Co-worker 1 was not a qualified interpreter. Even assuming Co-worker 1 could communicate with complainant with her limited signing ability in a casual one-on-one setting, this does not establish that she was qualified to provide interpretive services in a group meeting setting. In <span class="Italic">Marcum v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01892554 (January 22, 1990), the Commission found that the husband of a deaf employee who communicated with his co-worker wife using sign language was not a qualified interpreter. As stated in the decision, the critical point was whether the employee's husband was qualified to interpret. Such interpretation would require the husband to translate or interpret the employee's sign language (which she considered as her primary <span id="Page_1348"></span>language) to those who could not understand sign language, and to translate or interpret the English language to the employee by using sign language. The decision found that the fact that the employee and her husband could communicate with one another did not necessarily mean that the spouse was qualified to serve as an interpreter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's supervisor also explained that she utilized Co-worker 1 as an "interpreter" because the two meetings were emergencies. She stated the August 4, 2004 meeting was an emergency regarding a severe beating of an employee, but complainant submitted a police report on appeal showing more likely than not that the severe beating occurred some two months after the meeting. And the supervisor did not explain the nature of the emergency of the September 14, 2004 meeting. While the August 4, 2004 meeting regarding employees making trouble by delaying mail was an urgent matter, the record does not show that advanced arrangements could not be made to secure an interpreter since it is likely arrangements were made to secure the two presenters. In fact, one of the presenters told the EEO counselor that it was the job of the supervisor to make arrangements for an interpreter, and one should be provided at all future meetings, suggesting the meeting time could have been adjusted. Even if the meetings were emergencies scheduled with little notice, no effort was made to contact a qualified interpreter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable accommodation must be provided unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of its program. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a). The agency has not met its burden here. There is no evidence of any attempt by the agency to contact a qualified interpreter for the meetings in question, and the record does not show arrangements could not be made to cover the meetings. Accordingly, the agency failed to reasonably accommodate complaint regarding claims 1 and 2, violating the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the wake of September 11th, the Commission rejected an argument that the agency did not have sufficient time to provide an interpreter for a service talk on anthrax and a subsequent questioning of the complainant by Postal Inspectors. In <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A42499.txt">01A42499</a> (2004), contrary to the agency's arguments, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that complainant established that he was denied a reasonable accommodation with respect to the agency's failure to provide an interpreter on October 17, 2001, during a service talk about anthrax, and on October 23, 2001, when local police and Postal Inspectors questioned him. The agency contends that the events at issue occurred during "unusual" and "emergency" circumstances, such that a reasonable person could not find that the failure to provide complainant an interpreter constituted a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The agency also suggests that the speaker of the October 17, 2001 safety talk may have visited the facility unplanned. However, the agency cannot avoid its obligation to provide complainant a reasonable accommodation simply because of difficulty scheduling the services of an interpreter in a timely manner. We find that to the contrary, that in this extraordinary circumstance, where the physical safety of complainant and his co-workers hi the workplace was the subject of discussion, it was uniquely pressing for complainant to have access to the information being conveyed. We further find that the agency has not persuaded the Commission that the provision of an interpreter to complainant on October 17, 2001 or October 23, 2001, would have caused an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bratsch v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A40695 (2006); <span class="Italic">Heffley v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40138 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Apparently, the agency did not get the message in <span class="Italic">Bratsch</span>, which had also previously been the subject of a breach finding by the EEOC for failing to provide an interpreter--<span class="Italic">Bratsch v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950296 (1996)--as it subsequently failed to provide him with a sign language interpreter for a 15-30 minute meeting his supervisor held with coworkers to discuss a new break schedule. The complainant attempted to get the attention of his supervisor during the discussion, and the supervisor provided the new break instructions to the complainant immediately after informing his coworkers. In <span class="Italic">Bratsch v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420100013 (2010), the Commission found that the agency violated its previous enforcement order in failing to accommodate the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the agency acknowledged that, on or about August 4, 2008, petitioner's supervisor held a 15-30 minute discussion with petitioner's coworkers that excluded petitioner and that he separately discussed the information disseminated to the coworkers with petitioner after the coworkers dispersed. Petitioner further stated that he tried to get the supervisor's attention during the discussion, the supervisor wrote notes to him, but "it was quite obvious that the talk was completed with my co-workers because they all disbursed." The agency has not shown that extenuating circumstances existed that would in any way justify the holding a meeting without providing an interpreter for petitioner so that he could participate in the discussion concurrently with his coworkers. Thus, we find that the agency violated our order in EEOC Appeal No. 01A40695.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Krewsky v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120102511 (2012), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant when it did not provider an interpreter for required CPR training, even though the complainant attended and successfully completed the training.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a meeting is not required does not necessarily excuse an agency from providing an interpreter for an employee who is hearing-impaired and is entitled to accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Wait v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A11629 (2003), the Commission found the agency failed to accommodate the complainant when it repeatedly failed to provide an interpreter for optional staff meetings because workplace issues were discussed at those meetings. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Wait</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record establishes that after April 29, 1999, the agency was aware that complainant needed a sign language interpreter to attend meetings of four or more people. This information was further supplemented in July 16, 1999, when complainant's doctor informed the agency that complainant needed an interpreter for any meeting where pertinent information was disseminated. Although the agency argued in its FAD that by August 1999, complainant had received "assurances" that a sign language interpreter would be provided for staff meetings and training sessions, in a March 2000 deposition, complainant's second-line supervisor (S2) testified that staff meetings, which were generally attended by approximately 30-35 people, were held twice per month, and that even after the agency learned of complainant's need for an interpreter in such situations, none was provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the staff meetings were not mandatory, it is undisputed that employees were asked to attend and that information was provided concerning workplace issues. The agency argued that complainant received an agenda of the meetings and that complainant acknowledged she attended the meetings even though no interpreter was provided, augmenting her ability to hear and read lips by sitting close to S2. Complainant argued, however, that this was not sufficient and that she needed an interpreter to fully understand what was being said. In so arguing, she explained that while she can effectively read lips in conversations with one person, she cannot do so in larger groups. We agree with complainant that the agency did not provide a reasonable accommodation by providing her with an agenda and expecting her to sit close to S2. This did not provide complainant with equal access to the information communicated in the workplace, nor did it comply with Commission precedent that requires the agency to provide interpreters for discussions on workplace issues<span class="Italic">. See Reiley</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Feris,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Although S2 argued that complainant told her she did not need an interpreter, the record does not support this claim. Complainant testified that she repeatedly asked for an interpreter for staff meetings and training videos. Moreover, as of April 29, 1999, S2 possessed medical documentation that in meetings with four or more people, complainant required an interpreter. Accordingly, the agency denied complainant a reasonable accommodation when it failed to provide a sign language interpreter for numerous staff meetings held after April 29, 1999.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the agency made no argument that providing an interpreter for staff meetings would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(p). In her affidavit, S2 mentioned that it would very expensive to provide an interpreter for every staff meeting, but provided no details concerning this argument. The agency therefore failed to establish that providing an interpreter for staff meetings would be an undue hardship. The agency's finding of no discrimination in regard to Issue 3 of Complaint 3 is therefore REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency similarly denied complainant a reasonable accommodation when, on July 26, 1999, she was asked to watch a video tape of a previously offered training session without closed-captioning or an interpreter. Again, at this point there is no question that the agency was aware that complainant required an interpreter for all meetings where pertinent information was disseminated, as indicated in complainant's doctor's July 16, 1999 response to the agency's request for clarification. Moreover, the record establishes that on July 21, 1999, the agency's Chief Administrative Law Judge (CALJ) issued a memo responding to inquiries he had received concerning hearing-impaired employees and video training sessions. CALJ noted that a sign language interpreter must be provided for any class with one or more deaf or hard-of-hearing trainees so that training is accessible to all qualified employees with disabilities. Yet complainant was still scheduled to view the training video on July 26, 1999, despite the agency's inability to obtain an interpreter for that day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argued that complainant was not forced to attend this viewing and that she was told that if she did not want to try to hear the video by increasing the volume, the viewing session would be cancelled. Complainant argued, however, that she only agreed to watch the video without an accommodation because she feared it would be regarded as insubordination to refuse after she had repeatedly requested an interpreter and informed agency officials that she could not successfully understand the video without closed captioning or an interpreter and she was nevertheless asked to do so. We find the agency's argument that <span id="Page_1349"></span>it did not deny complainant an accommodation because she was not forced to view the video singularly unpersuasive in these circumstances. It is undisputed that complainant had repeatedly requested an interpreter to view the video, provided medical documentation supporting her claim that her hearing impairment required an interpreter, and informed agency officials that she would not be able to understand the video without closed-captioning or an interpreter. The agency nonetheless continued to request that complainant view the video without either of these accommodations. Thus, we find that the agency denied complainant an accommodation when it scheduled the viewing of the training video on a day when it was unable to provide an interpreter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency did not argue that providing an interpreter in this instance would have imposed an undue hardship on the operations of its business, nor is there any evidence to indicate as much. The agency's finding of no discrimination in regard to Issue 2 of Complaint 3 is therefore REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120053293 (2007), holding that the complainant was entitled to a sign language interpreter for a Step 1 grievance meeting even though an employee's attendance was not required at Step 1 meetings. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Gunn</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to claim (4), the agency asserts that, while the Step 1 meeting on August 7, 2002, was scheduled to discuss a grievance filed by complainant, employees are only sometimes allowed to attend such meetings as a courtesy. Specifically, S-1 testified that the Step 1 meeting involved the union and management, and as such, the agency was not required to provide complainant with an interpreter. Despite the agency's explanations, the Commission remains unpersuaded that complainant did not require an interpreter. First, we find Step 1 meetings are a work-related activity where a hearing impaired employee may be expected to be present.<span class="Italic"> See Ortiz, supra.</span> Second, even if complainant's presence was not required during a Step 1 meeting for a grievance which he filed, employers must ensure that employees with disabilities have access to information that is provided to other similarly-situated employees without disabilities, regardless of whether they need it to perform their jobs. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance), No. 915.002 (rev. October 17, 2002), at Question and Answer 14. In this regard, the agency acknowledges that it sometimes allowed other employees to attend such meetings. As such, the Commission finds that, once a hearing impaired employee was allowed to attend the meeting, the agency should have provided an interpreter where the Step 1 meeting, as a work related-activity, afforded access to information that similarly-situated employees without hearing impairments received.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the fact that the meeting is not directly work-related does not excuse the agency from providing an interpreter when the meeting is required. In <span class="Italic">Yost v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51457 (2006), the agency failed to provide the complainant with an interpreter for three meetings. The first meeting involved a bone marrow transplant program that the agency was promoting where a film with no close-captioning was shown. The second meeting involved a "stand-up" work procedures talk where the complainant was given the information in written form. The third meeting was a training session on prevention of sexual harassment. In <span class="Italic">Yos</span>t, the Commission found that the agency had failed to accommodate the complainant on all three occasions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that complainant did not need an interpreter at any of these meetings because he is able to read lips and frequently does not need an interpreter in meetings with supervisors. We have held however that an agency's obligation to accommodate a deaf employee is not diminished where the employee has the ability to read lips. <span class="Italic">See Wait v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A11629 (Oct. 2, 2003). We have also held that for a severely hearing impaired employee who can sign, reasonable accommodation, at a minimum, requires providing an interpreter for safety talks, discussions on work procedures, policies or assignments, and for every disciplinary action so that the employee can understand what is occurring at any and every crucial time in his employment career, whether or not he asks for an interpreter. <span class="Italic">See Feris v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934828 (Aug. 10, 1995),<span class="Italic"> request for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950936 (July 19, 1996). Moreover, we have found the Rehabilitation Act to require that an agency reasonably accommodate hearing impaired employees by providing effective interpreter services during work-related activities where hearing impaired employees are expected to be present.<span class="Italic"> See Ortiz v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960270 (Oct 16, 1998) (emphasis added). Therefore, it matters not that complainant, who can read lips and sign, did not request that an interpreter be available at the January 6 or July 7, 2003 meetings. He was still entitled to such a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that it matters not under these circumstances that the January 6th and July 7th meetings were not directly work-related, or necessary to perform complainant's essential job functions. The meetings were mandatory, not optional. Complainant was required to attend as part of the workforce. Moreover, regarding the films, we note that the collective bargaining agreement calls on management to provide closed-captioning on all films designed for training and instructional purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> Memorandum of Understanding Between USPS and American Postal Workers Union, Reasonable Accommodation for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, at 279. Clearly, the sexual harassment film was for training purposes. We find the film on bone marrow donations to also be instructional, as the agency had taken upon itself to engage in the program, and it showed the film to educate employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have held that an employer must ensure that employees with disabilities have access to information that is provided to other similarly-situated employees without disabilities, regardless of whether they need it to perform their jobs.<span class="Italic"> See Wait v. Soc. Sec. Admin,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A11629 (Oct. 2, 2003) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Reiley v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10019 (June 5, 2002); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Question 14 (Oct. 17, 2002). The fact that the agency later accommodated complainant by allowing complainant to view the films with an interpreter was too little an accommodation too late. By not providing complainant with an interpreter at the meetings, complainant did not benefit from the questions and comments that arose during the larger group exchange. Thus, he was denied equal access to information. The fact that the agency later accommodated complainant with an interpreter further begs the question: why did it not do so for the first general meetings? It appears the agency accommodated the hearing impaired employees only after they protested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly with regard to the March 10th stand-up talk, we again find that the agency failed to accommodate complainant, even though he received a written copy of the pertinent issues that were discussed. On this point, we find SDO2 to not be credible. He suggested that the meeting lasted approximately five minutes, yet he fails to bring forth time-keeping documentation and he admits that some question and answer exchanges may have occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> Affidavit E. Again, for the reasons set forth above, we find that this was another work-related instance that required the availability of an interpreter. The hard copy was an insufficient accommodation. We further remark that SDO2 is mistaken as to the agency's obligation to inform hearing impaired employees. Contrary to what he stated in his affidavit, <span class="Italic">see</span> Affidavit E ("Management is not responsible for informing hearing-impaired employees of nonessential information."), the agency must inform these employees of all work-related information, regardless of whether it is essential to the particular employee's job functions or not. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960270 (Oct 16, 1998); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Question 14 (Oct. 17, 2002) ("Employers must ensure that employees with disabilities have access to information that is provided to other similarly-situated employees without disabilities, regardless of whether they need it to perform their jobs.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the agency's argument that it would be an undue hardship to have an interpreter available for all stand-up meetings, we find it unpersuasive. There is no evidence that providing interpreter services would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial or disruptive or that it would fundamentally alter the nature of the agency's operation.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p). In fact, the record shows that management is not clear as to what kinds of accommodations for the hearing impaired would or would not constitute an undue hardship. Management must have a clear understanding of its reasonable accommodation obligations, particularly when hearing impaired employees form part of their workforce. No management official here explained how providing an interpreter during mandatory meetings such as the ones here at issue would be an undue hardship for the agency. Claims of undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show providing an interpreter, or any other reasonable accommodation, would cause a significant difficulty or expense to the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120114151 (2013) ("full participation in meetings and training classes is a benefit and a privilege of employment for which a reasonable accommodation should have been provided, absent undue hardship.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In an interesting case, the Commission found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant by not providing an interpreter for a "walk-in" visit to the EEO office. In <span class="Italic">Jorezak v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 012010311 (2012), the Commission noted that the visit was voluntary on the complainant's part and neither required nor controlled by the agency. Moreover, the complainant had been previously advised by the agency that an interpret would be provided if he requested one in advance.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121221 (2014), the Commission found that the agency denied the complainant reasonable accommodation when it provided training on a "buddy system" to hearing employees but <span id="Page_1350"></span>not hearing-impaired employees. Under the system, hearing employees were training on their responsibilities for pairing up with hearing-impaired employees in the event of a biohazard alarm. The Commission also found that the complainant was denied reasonable accommodation when the agency did not provide an interpreter for meetings with his union representative. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claim (5), Complainant claims that on August 18, 2010, during training for Biohazard Detected System training, he was not provided an interpreter. Complainant stated that he showed up at the training; however, he did not understand it due to the lack of an interpreter. Person A responded that "the buddy system" was in place which meant that the training was only held with the hearing employees and that they were instructed if an alarm goes off and they are working with a deaf or hard of hearing employee, that they were to get them and leave the building together. The Agency stated that Complainant did not go to the Biohazard Detected System training and thus, was not denied an interpreter at that training. Upon review, we note the Agency admits that it provided the Biohazard Detected System training on August 18, 2010, only to hearing employees, and thus, acknowledges it did not provide Complainant this training based on his disability. We reject the Agency's claim that Complainant was reasonably accommodated as a result of the described "buddy system" and we find Complainant was discriminated against on the basis of his disability in claim (5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claim (8), Complainant claimed that he was denied an interpreter during meetings with his union steward which meant he could not communicate with his union steward at meetings. We note that in his affidavit, Complainant stated that he was called into the office by Person A five times and that his union steward was present and that she would write on a piece of paper what was being said, but it was not clear to him what was being said. We find that full participation during meetings is one of the benefits of employment for which a reasonable accommodation should have been provided. We find the record supports a finding that Complainant was also denied a reasonable accommodation when the Agency failed to provide him an interpreter during meetings while Person A was a manager at the Lansing P &#x0026; DC.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency does provide an interpreter as a reasonable accommodation and there is a dispute that involves the interpreter, the agency may be required to provide an "outside" interpreter to resolve the dispute. For example, in <span class="Italic">Atkins v. Social Security Administration</span>, 02970004 (2000), the Commission found the interpreter's involvement in the disciplinary actions against the complainant made the failure to provide an outside interpreter also a failure to make reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In each of the four incidents, grievant requested--and under agency rules was entitled to have--the services of an "outside" ASL interpreter. Instead, in each instance, two of which directly arose from actions of the Interpreter, the agency insisted that grievant communicate through the Interpreter, notwithstanding its knowledge of the acrimonious relationship which had developed between them; notwithstanding its knowledge that grievant and her deaf coworkers challenged the Interpreter's qualifications as being inadequate to the services required of her; and notwithstanding that the Interpreter clearly had a stake in the outcome of at least two, if not all of these matters. For example, in the meeting regarding the mail room, grievant maintains that she signed it was "a crazy situation," which the Interpreter conveyed to the supervisor as grievant calling the supervisor "a crazy woman." The supervisor refused even to entertain the possibility that the Interpreter had erred, stating that she (the supervisor) knew what the "crazy" gesture meant. However, the sign for "crazy" had to be accompanied by some other sign--either "situation" or "woman"--to complete the thought. The supervisor did not profess to know either of those signs, leaving only grievant's word against that of the Interpreter as to whether grievant's statement had been correctly interpreted. Under the circumstances, the accuracy of the interpretation is not without doubt. In this regard, the Commission notes that, according to evidence of record, the Interpreter holds the lowest possible qualification. She is only qualified to interpret in one-on-one situations where there is opportunity for clarification and feed-back and which are of a non-technical nature, and the qualification guidelines "strongly suggest" that an individual at this level function under the close supervision of a more highly qualified interpreter. Notwithstanding favorable comments from deaf members of the public who have used the Interpreter's services, grievant and her two deaf coworkers, all of whom are fluent in ASL, have criticized the Interpreter's abilities as being inadequate, inaccurate, and insufficient to meet their needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that, while in each incident cited by the agency there may actually have been an element of insubordination which might have supported a disciplinary action, the involvement of the Interpreter seriously calls into question whether there was, in fact, grounds for the type of discipline that was imposed in each instance. With regard to the June 30, 1994, reprimand, grievant may, in fact, have been insubordinate with regard to the mail-room duties. However, she was also charged with "insulting, demeaning, and discourteous behavior towards a supervisor," which clearly stems from the Interpreter having stated that grievant called her supervisor a "crazy woman" as opposed to having said that it was a "crazy situation," and from the supervisor having refused to even entertain the possibility that the Interpreter was in error. There is no evidence that grievant would have received any discipline based solely on the discussion regarding mail-room duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The taint upon the June 30, 1994, written reprimand in turn tainted the July 6, 1994, one-day suspension imposed on account of grievant's failure to complete a priority assignment. The notice of suspension clearly states that the penalty was predicated on grievant having received the earlier written reprimand. There is no evidence that in the absence of the written reprimand, grievant would have received the one-day suspension. Likewise, the August 3, 1994, 14-day suspension clearly states that it was predicated on the prior discipline received by grievant, and there is no evidence that grievant would have received the suspension in the absence of the prior discipline. Lastly, although the September 20, 1994, letter of reprimand states that grievant was not disciplined more severely because she was already under a suspension, there is no evidence that she would have received even a written reprimand for this incident in the absence of the prior discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further finds that the agency's actions in denying grievant the services of an outside interpreter amount to a failure to reasonably accommodate grievant's disability. A disabled employee, while not entitled to the accommodation of his or her choice, is entitled to an effective accommodation<span class="Italic">. E.g., Parnofiello v. Dept. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966451 (June 30, 1999). Under the circumstances of this case--the acrimonious relationship of grievant and the Interpreter, the Interpreter's apparent lack of ability, and the Interpreter's personal involvement in most of the events at issue--the accommodation provided can hardly be said to be effective. Particularly with regard to the incident wherein grievant and the Interpreter were involved in an argument, the Commission finds it incomprehensible that the agency could think it a reasonable accommodation to force grievant either to utilize the services of the Interpreter or to remain silent. In this regard, the record indicates that grievant was threatened with loss of her job if she did not use the services of the Interpreter during the disciplinary discussion that followed the argument.</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure to provide an interpreter can result in a waiver of the time limit for initiating EEO counseling where the employee demonstrates that, because of the failure, he did not understand the proper procedures for filing a complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Nucci v. Postmaster General</span>, 01882131 (1988). The use of finger spelling instead of American Sign Language and written communications was not an adequate substitute where the employee repeatedly asked for an interpreter and had difficulty reading English. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05970651 (1997) (requiring an interpreter for EEO counseling).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to provide a qualified interpreter for a hearing-impaired person can result in a settlement agreement being declared void. Communicating with the complainant in writing and relying upon his girlfriend, who was not a certified interpreter, to communicate with the complainant was not a reasonable accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Dardis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924524 (1993), the Commission rejected the agency's efforts, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has demonstrated that he is qualified for the position and that his hearing impairment limited his ability to hear and communicate. Appellant's hearing impairment, however, could be accommodated by providing him with a certified interpreter. Here, the agency argues, and the AJ agrees that appellant did not need an accommodation because he and his supervisor communicated in writing and in one instance appellant's girlfriend, who was not a certified interpreter, communicated a document to him in sign language. The Commission disagrees. Where an accommodation is necessary to enable appellant to perform the essential functions of his position, the agency has an affirmative obligation to make a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">School Bd. of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273 (1987). The agency did not do that here. The record shows that appellant was not provided a certified interpreter at disciplinary discussions or at the grievance proceeding when he signed the Last Chance Agreement, but was forced to rely on lip reading and reading written documents to understand the significance of the discipline and agreement. Thus, absent adequate and full communication, it is questionable whether appellant was fully aware that his attendance record was the basis for the discipline that he received. Further, without a qualified interpreter, appellant would have also been at a disadvantage in presenting his response to the proposed discipline and understanding the Last Chance Agreement. Thus, the lack of a certified interpreter may have contributed to appellant's receipt of the letter of warning, 7-day suspension, notices of removal, and Last Chance Agreement, which makes them discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has not shown that providing appellant with a certified interpreter would have caused it an undue hardship. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency discriminated against appellant on the basis of his physical disability (hearing impaired) when it failed to provide <span id="Page_1351"></span>appellant with a certified interpreter as a reasonable accommodation of his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the same case, the Commission found the complainant was subjected to disparate treatment on the basis of his disability when the agency failed to provide him a certified interpreter for EAP meetings and instead referred him to AA counseling in another city. "Appellant should have been allowed to attend the same meetings made available for individuals without physical disabilities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency is obligated to provide an interpreter to a hearing-impaired person as a reasonable accommodation, that obligation extends to after-hours settlement discussions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05990764 (2000). An allegation that the agency only provided an interpreter for four hours of mediation instead of the whole session states a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10579 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fischthal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931457 (1993), the Commission declined to rule on an agency contention that provision of a certified interpreter for a particular complainant would be an undue hardship because it would cost over $100,000 annually to similarly accommodate all hearing-impaired employees in the division. The Commission held that the agency's cost to accommodate all hearing-impaired employees was not relevant. Only the cost of providing a certified interpreter to the complainant was at issue. The Commission estimated it would cost only about $4,000 per year to accommodate the complainant and, given the division's $475 million annual budget, found the accommodation would impose only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> burden on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01930806 (1993), the Commission found that the agency had not reasonably accommodated a hearing-impaired person by providing her with audio tapes of a conference rather than letting her attend with a personal assistant. The Commission noted that the agency introduced no evidence as to cost of the accommodation or why, in light of the agency's budget, such cost would have been prohibitive. A similar finding has been reached in cases where the agency failed to provide a human reader for visually-impaired employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01930993 (1993) (agency introduced no evidence to show that expense of a reader would place an undue hardship on it).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate a complainant by providing an interpreter at a meeting where it gave him his notice of removal and inquired into any defenses he may have does not require reversal of the removal where the complainant has committed the underlying offense. <span class="Italic">Funk v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984772 (2001). However, the complainant was entitled to a determination on his claim for compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cruzan v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120071893 (2008), the Commission found that the agency failed to demonstrate an undue hardship in not deploying an interpreter to Iraq for a hearing-impaired Intelligence Officer. Although the agency asserted that deploying an interpreter with the complainant would have created a shortage of interpreters for hearing-impaired employees in the Washington, D.C. area, it submitted no evidence to establish the effects of deploying an interpreter to Iraq. The Commission also noted several delays by the agency is responding to the complainant's requests for accommodation and the fact that one of the interpreters had previously been deployed to Iraq to serve as a linguist.</p>
