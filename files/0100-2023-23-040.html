<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-40"><span class="space">12.</span> Substantial Limitation on Working</h4>
<p class="noindent">Most of the major life activities are self-explanatory, but the same is not true of working. Working has been the most controversial of the major life activities, in part, because of the difficulty of defining precisely what "working" as a major life activity means, but more particularly in defining what a substantial limitation on the major life activity of working means. Although Congress, in passing the ADAAA, conclusively resolved the controversy over whether working was a major life activity, it did little to resolve the definition of the term either as a major life activity or a substantial limitation. In including working as a major life activity under the ADAAA, Congress was again rejecting the Supreme Court's view of the ADA. Although the Supreme Court had not specifically ruled that working was not a major life activity, it had, as discussed more fully below, raised serious questions about working as a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, what it means to be substantially limited in a major life activity may be a largely academic discussion. In adopting its final ADAAA regulations, the Commission has deleted any specific discussion of when an individual will be substantially limited in the major life activity of working because it believes "this major life activity will be used in only very targeted situations." 76 FR 17013. To the extent that working is addressed as a major life activity under the ADAAA, it is clear that the Commission will apply the rules of construction <span id="Page_1128"></span>discussed above and take a broad view with respect to coverage and what it means to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent">Early case law on the subject held that when the complainant contended that the life activity which was limited was working, he needed to show "that his impairment disqualifies him from employment in his chosen field." <span class="Italic">Yasutake v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01871955 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">E.E. Black, Ltd. v. Marshall</span>, 497 F. Supp. 1088 (D. Hawaii 1980)). In the <span class="Italic">Yasutake</span> case, the Commission found that fear of flying did not constitute impairment of the major life activity of working as an EEO specialist who was required to travel frequently. The Commission noted the complainant was unable to prove he would be disqualified from the same or similar positions in his geographic region due to his fear of flying. It was the demands of the particular job, rather than a limitation of work in the complainant's chosen field, that rendered him unable to perform satisfactorily for the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has consistently held the view that all other major life activities must be evaluated before working is considered. Prior to the ADAAA, the Commission's regulations provide that if a complainant's impairment does not substantially limit any other major life activity, then consideration is given to whether the complainant is substantially limited in the major life activity of working. 29 CFR 1630, app. at 1630.2(j). This view was carried forward in the Commission's proposed ADAAA regulations, at 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(7), which stated "[a]n individual will usually be substantially limited in another major life activity, making it unnecessary to consider whether the individual is substantially limited in working." 74 FR 48442.</p>
<p class="noindent">Much of the problem with working as a major life activity and whether it was substantially limiting was not so much with the concept of working as a major life activity, but the Commission's definition of working under its oriGINAl ADA regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3) that provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;The term substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(ii)&#x2003;In addition to the factors listed in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the following factors may be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of "working": (A) The geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access; (B) The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or (C) The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in various classes).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the ADAAA, Congress specifically instructed the Commission that defining the term "substantially limited" as being "significantly restricted" was not consistent with congressional intent and set "too high a standard." Uncodified Findings, Sec. 2(a)(8). But aside from the standard for being substantially limited in working, it was difficult to define the actual activity in terms of what constituted a class or jobs or a broad range of jobs across various classes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's ADA regulation further explained its regulation at 29 CFR 1630, app. at 1630.2(j):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, an individual is not substantially limited in working just because he or she is unable to perform a particular job for one employer, or because he or she is unable to perform a specialized job or profession requiring extraordinary skill, prowess or talent. For example, an individual who cannot be a commercial airline pilot because of a minor vision impairment, but who can be a commercial airline copilot or a pilot for a courier service, would not be substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Nor would a professional baseball pitcher who develops a bad elbow and can no longer throw a baseball be considered substantially limited in the major life activity of working. In both of these examples, the individuals are not substantially limited in the ability to perform any other major life activity and, with regard to the major life activity of working, are only unable to perform either a particular specialized job or a narrow range of jobs<span class="Italic">. See Forrisi v. Bowen</span>, 794 F.2d 931 (4th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Jasany v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 755 F.2d 1244 (6th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">E.E Black, Ltd. v. Marshall</span>, 497 F. Supp. 1088 (D. Hawaii 1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, an individual does not have to be totally unable to work in order to be considered substantially limited in the major life activity of working. An individual is substantially limited in working if the individual is significantly restricted in the ability to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes, when compared with the ability of the average person with comparable qualifications to perform those same jobs. For example, an individual who has a back condition that prevents the individual from performing any heavy labor job would be substantially limited in the major life activity of working because the individual's impairment eliminates his or her ability to perform a class of jobs. This would be so even if the individual were able to perform jobs in another class, e.g., the class of semi-skilled jobs. Similarly, suppose an individual has an allergy to a substance found in most high rise office buildings, but seldom found elsewhere, that makes breathing extremely difficult. Since this individual would be substantially limited in the ability to perform the broad range of jobs in various classes that are conducted in high rise office buildings within the geographical area to which he or she has reasonable access, he or she would be substantially limited in working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The terms "number and types of jobs" and "number and types of other jobs," as used in the factors discussed above, are not intended to require an onerous evidentiary showing. Rather, the terms only require the presentation of evidence of general employment demographics and/or of recognized occupational classifications that indicate the approximate number of jobs (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, "few," "many," "most") from which an individual would be excluded because of an impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an individual has a "mental or physical impairment" that "substantially limits" his or her ability to perform one or more "major life activities," that individual will satisfy the first part of the regulatory definition of "disability" and will be considered an individual with a disability. An individual who satisfies this first part of the definition of the term "disability" is not required to demonstrate that he or she satisfies either of the other parts of the definition. However, if an individual is unable to satisfy this part of the definition, he or she may be able to satisfy one of the other parts of the definition.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed.2d 450 (1999), the Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs whose myopia disqualified them from being global pilots did not substantially limit the major life activity of working because they could qualify as regional pilots or flight instructors. As noted above, however, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> did question whether working could in fact be a major life activity. The Court in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 2151, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the parties accept that the term "major life activities" includes working, we do not determine the validity of the cited regulations. We note, however, that there may be some conceptual difficulty in defining "major life activities" to include work, for it seems "to argue in a circle to say that if one is excluded, for instance, by reason of [an impairment, from working with others]...then that exclusion constitutes an impairment, when the question you're asking is, whether the exclusion itself is by reason of handicap." <span class="Italic">Tr. of Oral Arg. in School Bd. of Nassau Co. v. Arline</span>, O.T.1986, No. 85-1277, p. 15 (argument of Solicitor General). Indeed, even the EEOC has expressed reluctance to define "major life activities" to include working and has suggested that working be viewed as a residual life activity, considered, as a last resort, only "[i]f an individual is not substantially limited with respect to any other major life activity." 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j) (1998) ("If an individual is substantially limited in any other major life activity, no determination should be made as to whether the individual is substantially limited in working."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also Murphy, supra</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 2138 (assuming without deciding that working is a major life activity).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to including work as a major life activity in <span class="Italic">Arline</span>, 480 U.S. at 281, 119 S. Ct. at 1129 n.10 ("The United States recognized that 'working' was one of the major life activities listed in the regulations, but said that to argue that a condition that impaired only the ability to work was a handicapping condition was to make 'a totally circular argument which lifts itself by its bootstraps.'...The argument is not circular, however, it is direct. Congress plainly intended the Act to cover person's with a physical or mental impairment...that substantially limited one's ability to work.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The average person may well regard any debate about whether working is a major life activity to an academic debate and a rather silly one at that. Given the amount of time most people spend at work and the importance of work to basic survival, it does seem somewhat ridiculous to suggest that it is not a major life activity. The real problem, as noted above, is the difficulty in defining what it means to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working. The Commission, in its regulation, defined it as being significantly restricted in performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs across various classes. The Commission, however, has never been particularly successful in defining a class of jobs much less a broad range of jobs across classes.</p>
<p class="noindent">To some degree the Commission's view of working as the major life activity of last resort while not eliminating the debate of what it means to be substantially limited in working, at least relegates the debate to the back burner. In most instances where a complainant alleges a substantial limitation on working, there will be another major life activity that is substantially limited thus negating the need to consider working. For example, the complainant who alleges that she is substantially limited in working because of weight restrictions on her ability to lift is simply mischaracterizing the major life activity. If the restriction on lifting is sufficiently significant, the individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting and there is no need to consider whether she is also substantially limited in working.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1129"></span>The Commission's proposed ADAAA regulations, at 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(7)(ii) had replaced the previous requirement that an individual be substantially limited in performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs across various classes with a "type of work at issue" standard. The Commission's current view with regard to working is expressed in an uncodified section of the appendix to Part 1630:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has removed from the text of the regulations a discussion of the major life activity of working. This is consistent with the fact that no other major life activity receives special attention in the regulation, and with the fact that, in light of the expanded definition of disability established by the Amendments Act, this major life activity will be used in only very targeted situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In most instances, an individual with a disability will be able to establish coverage by showing substantial limitation of a major life activity other than working; impairments that substantially limit a person's ability to work usually substantially limit one or more other major life activities. This will be particularly true in light of the changes made by the ADA Amendments Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Corley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs ex rel Principi</span>, 218 F. App'x. 727, 738 (10th Cir. 2007) (employee with seizure disorder was not substantially limited in working because he was not foreclosed from jobs involving driving, operating machinery, childcare, military service, and other jobs; employee would now be substantially limited in neurological function); <span class="Italic">Olds v. United Parcel Serv., Inc</span>., 127 F. App'x. 779, 782 (6th Cir. 2005) (employee with bone marrow cancer was not substantially limited in working due to lifting restrictions caused by his cancer; employee would now be substantially limited in normal cell growth); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't</span>, 380 F.3d 751, 763-64 (3d Cir. 2004) (issue of material fact concerning whether police officer's major depression substantially limited him in performing a class of jobs due to restrictions on his ability to carry a firearm; officer would now be substantially limited in brain function).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the rare cases where an individual has a need to demonstrate that an impairment substantially limits him or her in working, the individual can do so by showing that the impairment substantially limits his or her ability to perform a class of jobs or broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to most people having comparable training, skills, and abilities. In keeping with the findings and purposes of the Amendments Act, the determination of coverage under the law should not require extensive and elaborate assessment, and the EEOC and the courts are to apply a lower standard in determining when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, including the major life activity of working, than they applied prior to the Amendments Act. The Commission believes that the courts, in applying an overly strict standard with regard to "substantially limits" generally, have reached conclusions with regard to what is necessary to demonstrate a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working that would be inconsistent with the changes now made by the Amendments Act. Accordingly, as used in this section the terms "class of jobs" and "broad range of jobs in various classes" will be applied in a more straightforward and simple manner than they were applied by the courts prior to the Amendments Act.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Demonstrating a substantial limitation in performing the unique aspects of a single specific job is not sufficient to establish that a person is substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A class of jobs may be determined by reference to the nature of the work that an individual is limited in performing (such as commercial truck driving, assembly line jobs, food service jobs, clerical jobs, or law enforcement jobs) or by reference to job-related requirements that an individual is limited in meeting (for example, jobs requiring repetitive bending, reaching, or manual tasks, jobs requiring repetitive or heavy lifting, prolonged sitting or standing, extensive walking, driving, or working under conditions such as high temperatures or noise levels).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, if a person whose job requires heavy lifting develops a disability that prevents him or her from lifting more than fifty pounds and, consequently, from performing not only his or her existing job but also other jobs that would similarly require heavy lifting, that person would be substantially limited in working because he or she is substantially limited in performing the class of jobs that require heavy lifting.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;In addition, many cases previously analyzed in terms of whether the plaintiff was "substantially limited in working" will now be analyzed under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability as revised by the Amendments Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cannon v. Levi Strauss &#x0026; Co</span>., 29 F. App'x. 331 (6th Cir. 2002) (factory worker laid off due to her carpal tunnel syndrome not regarded as substantially limited in working because her job of sewing machine operator was not a "broad class of jobs"; she would now be protected under the third prong because she was fired because of her impairment, carpal tunnel syndrome); <span class="Italic">Bridges v. City of Bossier</span>, 92 F.3d 329 (5th Cir. 1996) (applicant not hired for firefighting job because of his mild hemophilia not regarded as substantially limited in working; applicant would now be protected under the third prong because he was not hired because of his impairment, hemophilia).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In analyzing working as a major life activity in the past, some courts have imposed a complex and onerous standard that would be inappropriate under the Amendments Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Duncan v. WMATA</span>, 240 F.3d 1110, 1115 (DC Cir. 2001) (manual laborer whose back injury prevented him from lifting more than 20 pounds was not substantially limited in working because he did not present evidence of the number and types of jobs available to him in the Washington area; testimony concerning his inquiries and applications for truck driving jobs that all required heavy lifting was insufficient); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Federal Express Corp</span>., 429 F.3d 461, 463-64 (4th Cir. 2005) (employee's impairment did not substantially limit him in working because, even though evidence showed that employee's injury disqualified him from working in numerous jobs in his geographic region, it also showed that he remained qualified for many other jobs). Under the Amendments Act, the determination of whether a person is substantially limited in working is more straightforward and simple than it was prior to the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the ADAAA, the Commission found in a number of cases that the inability to perform a particular job was not a substantial limitation on working. For example, in <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03910101 (1991), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n individual is not substantially limited in his/her ability to work simply because he/she cannot perform one particular job for one particular employer. Rather, courts and the Commission look to the number and types of jobs from which the person is disqualified, the geographic area to which the individual has reasonable access, and the individual's job expectations and training. (citations omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03910097 (1991) (even the fact that the employee worked for 27 years as a sheet metal worker did not conclusively establish that his hearing loss constituted a substantial limitation of the ability to work where evidence was unclear on "whether his hearing loss generally forecloses petitioner's employment opportunities"). Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Webber v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01980587 (2001), found that the complainant's generalized anxiety disorder did not substantially limit her in the major life activity of working. The only evidence presented stated that the complainant was precluded "from effectively performing her particular job as a Recreation Specialist at the facility." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission found that there was no evidence that the complainant was substantially limited in her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes. The Commission noted that the medical evidence showed that the complainant's stress was in fact caused by her particular job.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant who suffered from depression and could no longer work on ships, and needed a low stress job with a routine that was consistent from day-to-day was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">Kice v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03A20013 (2002). The limitations did not significantly restrict the complainant from working in a class or broad range of jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Attorney General</span>, 01A11797 (2001), the Commission found that a drug enforcement agent with a respiratory allergy to marijuana was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working because he was only disqualified from performing a particular job and not a class or broad range of jobs. Though it is currently uncertain, <span class="Italic">Hickman</span> could represent the type of situation where working as a major life activity will be useful. One would not expect, in the normal course of affairs, for an individual with a respiratory allergy to marijuana to be exposed to it on a frequent enough basis for it to substantially limit the major life activity of breathing. But it does appear that the allergy disqualified the complainant from his chosen profession and, thus, could be considered a substantial limitation on his ability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant who maintained that the florescent lighting in the agency's computer unit gave her migraine headaches and triggered episodes of fibromyalgia was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">Mossburg v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995641 (2002). The Commission noted that the complainant did not contend there were any effects of her disability outside of the workplace and that she contended the symptoms would disappear if her workplace were changed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did find that a complainant whose disability prevented him from engaging in data entry was substantially limited in working. "Given data entry's current importance in the job market, we agree with the AJ's analysis that this type of work is not, by any means, limited to one particular job, but spans a broad class of jobs." <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991710 (2002). As a result, one who is unable to engage in large amounts of data entry is substantially limited in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DeVaughn v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993070 (2002), the Commission, relying on <span class="Italic">De Los Santos v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974430 (2001), found that the duties of a Postal Service Distribution and Window Clerk were sufficiently similar in nature to "clerical or administrative positions as well as retail or sales positions," and therefore the complainant was regarded as unable to perform a broad range of jobs in various classes. The Commission reached a similar conclusion in <span class="Italic">Liddy v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01542 (2002), where it found that the agency regarded the complainant as unable to perform the duties of a Material Clerk, which required working in a warehouse environment eight hours a day, <span id="Page_1130"></span>occasionally lifting up to 70 pounds and continually bending and stooping.</p>
<p class="noindent">When evaluating other whether other major life activities are substantially limited by an impairment, the Commission compares the individual to the "average person in the general population." However, when working is the major life activity, that "average person" takes on several of the characteristics of the particular complainant, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;The geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographic area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(C)&#x2003;The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographic area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in various classes).</p>
<p class="noindent">29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3). That distinction has been carried forward in the proposed regulations. "The type of work at issue may often be determined by reference to the nature of the work an individual is substantially limited in performing because of an impairment as compared to most people having comparable training, skills, and abilities." 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(7)(iii)(B); 74 FR 48442.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Slater v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01953835 (1997), the Commission found that appellant was substantially limited in the major life activity of working because his disabling condition restricted his ability to perform a class of jobs, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, those involving food handling and preparation. In <span class="Italic">Slater</span>, appellant was diagnosed as having chronic contact dermatitis. "Excessive exposure to commercial detergents and water caused appellant's hands to break out in small bumps and fissures, to itch and burn, and to swell." Medical evidence indicated that appellant's impairment was chronic.</p>
