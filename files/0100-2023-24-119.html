<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-99"><span class="space">2.</span> Resignations and Constructive Discharges</h4>
<p class="noindent">One problem that can occur with employees with mental disabilities is when the employee tries to rescind a letter of resignation. Depending on the circumstances, a request to rescind a letter of resignation can be construed as a request for reasonable accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Van Doren v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953958 (1997), the Commission found that the employee's request to rescind her resignation did constitute a request for reasonable accommodation where it was made prior to the effective date of the resignation, and the employee's mother and union representatives requested accommodation on her behalf. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Van Doren</span> distinguished an earlier case in which it held there was no nexus between the employee's disability and the agency's refusal to rescind her resignation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, appellant must establish a nexus between the barrier or work problem, that is the agency's refusal to rescind her resignation, and her mental disability. <span class="Italic">Hoang v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930915 (September 19, 1994). In <span class="Italic">Hoang</span>, the complainant was also challenging the agency's refusal to rescind his resignation. The Commission found that appellant failed to establish a connection between his disability and the agency's refusal to rescind his resignation. The Commission's finding was based on appellant's failure to ask for any accommodation at the time he submitted his resignation; appellant's rejection of his supervisor's attempts to talk him out of resigning; and appellant's attempt to rescind a valid resignation after it took effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Hoang</span> and that appellant <span id="Page_1364"></span>has established the requisite nexus between the agency's refusal to rescind her resignation and her disability. First, we find that the evidence clearly establishes that appellant sought to rescind her resignation before it became effective. Second, appellant, through her mother and union representatives, requested accommodation prior to the effective date of her resignation; that is, she requested that the agency allow her to rescind her resignation. Third, appellant's supervisor never attempted to talk to her regarding her resignation. Finally, appellant was never afforded the opportunity to withdraw her resignation. Accordingly, we find that appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further held the agency in <span class="Italic">Van Doren</span> failed to show that it would be an undue burden to accommodate appellant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's defense has centered on its contention that it was unaware of appellant's disability, and therefore had no duty to accommodate, and its contention that appellant's rescission was not submitted in a timely manner. The agency has not provided any evidence whatsoever of undue burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the agency's contentions concerning its awareness of appellant's disability and the untimeliness of appellant's rescission letter, we affirm the AJ's findings with regard to these issues. As the AJ noted in her decision, several of appellant's supervisors knew of her condition because they witnessed catatonic episodes at work. In fact, the record contains testimony to this effect, both at the hearing and in the form of a deposition from a Snapper Creek supervisor. In addition, the APWU President provided undisputed testimony that the Manager of appellant's facility was present when appellant experienced a catatonic episode in 1985, and that when she (the APWU President) attempted to speak to the Manager about appellant's mental condition, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away. Further, appellant's mother explained appellant's condition to the Personnel Specialist when she attempted to orally rescind appellant's resignation. Also, the APWU President testified that she advised the agency's personnel office of appellant's situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the AJ found that the agency witness' testimony regarding their lack of knowledge of appellant's disability was not credible. As a general rule, the Commission will defer to credibility determinations based on witness conduct or demeanor, because the AJ has had an opportunity to observe the witnesses, and the Commission has not. <span class="Italic">See Fitzhugh v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890981 (May 12, 1989). We also find that the record clearly establishes, as the AJ discussed in her decision, that appellant's attempts to rescind her resignation were timely. Accordingly, we find that the agency discriminated against appellant based on mental disability when it failed to accommodate her by not allowing her to rescind her resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A second problem that can occur for agencies in disability cases is when an employee resigns or retires after being denied an accommodation. In the appropriate circumstances, the denial of the accommodation may be such that the subsequent resignation or retirement is tantamount to a constructive discharge. In most cases, the denial of an accommodation will not be of such consequence that an employee feels compelled to resign or retire. However, in <span class="Italic">Holland v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A01372 (2003), the Commission found that a constructive discharge occurred when the agency failed to accommodate the obsessive-compulsive disorder of a telephone service representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central question in a constructive discharge case is whether the employer, through its unlawful discriminatory behavior, made the employee's working conditions so difficult that any reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. See Carmon-Coleman v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00003 (April 17, 2002). The Commission has established three elements which a complainant must prove to substantiate a claim of constructive discharge:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;the complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See Walch v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940688 (April 13, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the record confirms that at least as of January 1993, and specifically in its January 7, 1993 memorandum, the agency informed complainant that it would not provide him with any accommodation that would allow him to have periodic breaks from telephone duty. Moreover, this memorandum communicated to complainant that because management recognized that his psychiatric condition required such breaks, he could be terminated unless he found another position or took a downgrade to a clerical position. We further find that it is within the context of this unyielding posture, that the agency "recommends" that complainant consider disability retirement, even going so far as to provide complainant with a copy of his estimated disability retirement benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Continuing on this course, the record further reflects the agency's repeated denials in response to complainants numerous attempts to craft an accommodation that would meet his needs and be acceptable to the agency, insisting that complainant must remain "plugged-in" throughout his shift if he wanted to retain his position as a TSR. However, in stark contrast to the agency's steadfast refusal to accommodate complainant with periodic breaks, record testimony demonstrates that management displayed a most obliging attitude in encouraging complainant to apply for disability retirement. In fact, we find that it is likely this patronizing posture explains complainant's rather inconsistent statement in his November 27, 1995 letter to the MSPB, that while the agency did not "coerce" him into retiring, he nonetheless felt "pressured" to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find that the likely source of this "pressure" experienced by complainant was the choice presented by the agency: termination or disability retirement. In finding that complainant's choice was limited to these two options, we note that although the agency made occasional references to the possibility of a reassignment, it does not appear that the agency meaningfully endeavored to even ascertain whether a suitable position for reassignment existed during the time at issue. We find that the agency had an obligation under the Rehabilitation Act to explore the possibility of a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation given its posture that no accommodation existed which would allow complainant to perform his TSR duties<span class="Italic">. See Hampton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (August 1, 2002); 29 C.F.R. 1614.203(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that the agency admits that it did not inform complainant at any time prior to his August 1993 disability retirement, that his TSR position was slated for an up-grade and restructuring to include non-telephone duties effective the very same month as his retirement. In order words, the agency did not present the restructured TSR position as a third option to complainant as an alternative to either termination or disability retirement. Furthermore, we concur with the AJ that the agency's failure to disclose this crucial information to complainant must be viewed as bad faith. Specifically, we note that the agency's rationale for failing to disclose this information is that complainant seemed happy and content with his decision to retire, and telling him about the restructuring would only serve to aggravate him. Additionally, the agency also maintains that it chose not to tell complainant about the restructuring because it did not know enough about new duties in the restructured position to accurately access if it would work as an effective reasonable accommodation. We note NM's hearing testimony that she anticipated that complainant would ask a lot of questions about the restructured position if she told him about it, and she might not be able to answer them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After review, we find that the agency's rationale for not informing complainant about the restructured TSR position tend more to show that the agency simply did not want to bother undertaking an assessment of the restructured position as a possible reasonable accommodation, and also did not care to risk having complainant change his mind about retirement. In support of this finding, we note the statement made by NM, which she confirmed in her testimony at the damages hearing, that she hoped that complainant would take disability retirement so that the agency would not have to terminate him. We also find that while complainant may have finally resigned himself to the fact that he had to retire, we find that the acts of filing an appeal with the MSPB and an EEO complaint regarding this retirement certainly belies any agency claim that complainant was happy with his decision to retire.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, we note that the agency also argues that its failure to disclose or discuss the option of the restructured TSR position with complainant should not be viewed as bad faith because record evidence reflects that complainant's union representative was aware of the upcoming restructuring, and similarly did not disclose it to complainant. However, there is no evidence of record to indicate how the union representative learned of the restructuring, or to suggest that the responsible management officials ever held discussions with this union representative for the purpose of exploring whether the restructured TSR position might be an option for complainant. We find that whether or not this union representative made the disclosure to complainant has no bearing on the agency's failure to do so. Therefore, for the above stated reasons, we concur with the AJ's determination that the agency engaged in bad faith by failing to present the restructured TSR position as an option to complainant prior to the effective date of his disability retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that complainant chose disability retirement believing that he would otherwise be terminated. As noted by the Commission in the previous decision, complainant filed the instant complaint at about the same time he filed for disability retirement, claiming that he only applied for disability retirement because the agency refused to provide him with a reasonable accommodation which would allow him to remain employed. We find that a reasonable person, presented with such a choice, would find termination "intolerable," leaving no other recourse but to apply for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1365"></span>Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to comply with its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act when it declined to provide complainant with an effective reasonable accommodation, and that his disability retirement was a consequence of this discriminatory action, such that we conclude that the AJ did not err in finding that complainant's disability retirement was tantamount to a constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">Constructive discharge cases present another difficulty in and of themselves as it relates to jurisdiction and the fact that the employee if entitled to Merit System Protection Board appeal rights, the Board has primary jurisdiction over removal claims. Mixed cases and the intersection of MSPB and EEOC jurisdiction are discussed in <a href="0100-2023-29-001.html#sec20-1">Chapter 20</a>.</p>
