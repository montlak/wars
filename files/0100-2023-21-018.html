<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-19"><span class="space">A.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">MERITOR</span> AND <span class="Italic">HARRIS</span></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, a female bank employee alleged that after she was hired, she was subjected to several sexual advances by her supervisor. The employee alleged that over the course of a couple of years, she was forced to engage in sexual relations with the supervisor because she feared loss of her job if she refused. The sexual relationship with the supervisor ceased after the employee started dating a steady boyfriend. The employee also alleged that the supervisor fondled her in front of other employees, followed her into the bathroom, exposed himself to her, and also fondled other female employees. The employee pressed two distinct claims: one for <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment and one alleging the creation of a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The district court denied both claims without resolving the conflict in testimony between the employee and the supervisor about the existence of a sexual relationship. It did determine that if a sexual relationship existed, it was voluntary. It also precluded the employee from introducing most of her supporting evidence on the hostile environment claim. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court and ordered the case remanded on the hostile environment claim. Between trial and the appellate court decision in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, the D.C. Circuit had already found that a hostile environment claim of sexual harassment was viable. <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934 (D.C. Cir. 1981). The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although not greatly in dispute at that time, the Court first endorsed the EEOC's regulatory position, as well as the position of several federal courts, that <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment violated Title VII. It then proceeded to analyze whether a hostile environment claim not premised on the grant or denial of employment benefits was cognizable under Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, relying heavily upon the regulatory guidance of the EEOC, the Court wrote, in an opinion authored by then Justice Rehnquist, 477 U.S. at 65-69:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that so-called "hostile environment" (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span> non <span class="Italic">quid</span> <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">quo</span>) harassment violates Title VII, the EEOC <span class="Italic">drew</span> upon a substantial body of judicial decisions and EEOC precedent holding that Title VII affords employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 45 Fed. Reg. 74676 (1980). <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 234 (CA5 1971), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1972), was apparently the first case to recognize a cause of action based upon a discriminatory work environment. In <span class="Italic">Rogers</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Hispanic complainant could establish a Title VII violation by demonstrating that her employer created an offensive work environment for employees by giving discriminatory service to its Hispanic clientele. The court explained that an employee's protections under Title VII extend beyond the economic aspects of employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[T]he phrase 'terms, conditions or privileges of employment' in [Title VII] is an expansive concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination.... One can readily envision working environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and <span id="Page_812"></span>psychological stability of minority group workers...." 454 F.2d, at 238.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts applied this principle to harassment based on race, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Firefighters Institute for Racial Equality v. St. Louis</span>, 549 F.2d 506, 514-15 (CA8), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span> <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Banta v. United States</span>, 434 U.S. 819, 98 S. Ct. 60, 54 L. Ed.2d 76 (1977); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East</span>, 178 U.S. App. D.C. 91, 98, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (1976), religion, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Compston v. Borden, Inc.</span>, 424 F. Supp. 157 (SD Ohio 1976), and national origin, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cariddi v. Kansas City Chiefs Football Club</span>, 568 F.2d 87, 88 (CA8 1977). Nothing in Title VII suggests that a hostile environment based on discriminatory <span class="Italic">sexual</span> harassment should not be likewise prohibited. The Guidelines thus appropriately drew from, and were fully consistent with, the existing case law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Guidelines were issued, courts have uniformly held, and we agree, that a plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII by proving that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile environment. As the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit wrote in <span class="Italic">Henson v. Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 902 (1982):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Sexual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality. Surely, a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accord, <span class="Italic">Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251, 254-255 (CA4 1983); <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 205 U.S. App. D.C., at 444-454, 641 F.2d, at 934-944; <span class="Italic">Zabkowicz v. West Bend Co.</span>, 589 F. Supp. 780 (ED Wis. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, as the courts in both <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> and <span class="Italic">Henson</span> recognized, not all workplace conduct that may be described as "harassment" affects a "term, condition, or privilege" of employment within the meaning of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 238 ("mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee" would not affect the conditions of employment to sufficiently significant degree to violate Title VII); <span class="Italic">Henson</span>, 682 F.2d, at 904 (quoting same). For sexual harassment to be actionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive "to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Respondent's allegations in this case-which include not only pervasive harassment but also criminal conduct of the most serious nature-are plainly sufficient to state a claim for "hostile environment" sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question remains, however, whether the District Court's ultimate finding that respondent "was not the victim of sexual harassment," 22 EPD &#x00A7; 30,708, at 14,692-14,693, 23 FEP Cases, at 43, effectively disposed of respondent's claim. The Court of Appeals recognized, we think correctly, that this ultimate finding was likely based on one or both of two erroneous views of the law. First, the District Court apparently believed that a claim for sexual harassment will not lie absent an <span class="Italic">economic</span> effect on the complainant's employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">ibid</span>. ("It is without question that sexual harassment of female employees in which they are asked or required to submit to sexual demands as a <span class="Italic">condition to obtain employment or to maintain employment or to obtain promotions</span> falls with protection of Title VII") (emphasis added). Since it appears that the District Court made its findings without ever considering the "hostile environment" theory of sexual harassment, the Court of Appeals' decision to remand was correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the District Court's conclusion that no actionable harassment occurred might have rested on its earlier "finding" that "[i]f [respondent] and Taylor did engage in an intimate or sexual relationship..., that relationship was a voluntary one." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 14,692, 23 FEP Cases, at 42. But the fact that sex-related conduct was "voluntary," in the sense that the complainant was not forced to participate against her will, is not a defense to a sexual harassment suit brought against Title VII. The gravamen of any sexual harassment claim is that the alleged sexual advances were "unwelcome." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a) (1985). While the question whether particular conduct was indeed unwelcome presents difficult problems of proof and runs largely on credibility determinations committed to the trier of fact, the District Court in this case erroneously focused on the "voluntariness" of respondent's participation in the claimed sexual episodes. The correct inquiry is whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome, not whether her actual participation in sexual intercourse was voluntary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner contends that even if this case must be remanded to the District Court, the Court of Appeals erred in one of the terms of its remand. Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated that testimony about respondent's "dress and personal fantasies," 243 U.S. App. D.C., at 328, n.36, 753 F.2d, at 146, n.36, which the District Court apparently admitted into evidence, "had no place in this litigation." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. The apparent ground for this conclusion was that respondent's voluntariness <span class="Italic">vel</span> <span class="Italic">non</span> in submitting to Taylor's advances was immaterial to her sexual harassment claim. While "voluntariness" in the sense of consent is not a defense to such a claim, it does not follow that a complainant's sexually provocative speech or dress is irrelevant as a matter of law in determining whether he or she found particular sexual advances unwelcome. To the contrary, such evidence is obviously relevant. The EEOC Guidelines emphasize that the trier of fact must determine the existence of sexual harassment in light of "the record as a whole" and "the totality of circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b) (1985). Respondent's claim that any marGINAl relevance of the evidence in question was outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice is the sort of argument properly addressed to the District Court. In this case the District Court concluded that the evidence should be admitted, and the Court of Appeals' contrary conclusion was based upon the erroneous, categorical view that testimony about provocative dress and publicly expressed sexual fantasies "had no place in this litigation." 243 U.S. App. D.C., at 328, n.36, 753 F.2d, at 146, n.36. While the District Court must carefully weigh the applicable considerations in deciding whether to admit evidence of this kind, there is no <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> rule against its admissibility.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court specifically declined to issue a definitive ruling on the conditions under which an employer would be liable for hostile environment sexual harassment. However, it did, in <span class="Italic">dicta</span>, approve of the EEOC's application of agency principles to determine employer liability in hostile environment cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Two significant questions were left unaddressed by the Court in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>. The first was precisely what legal standard courts should apply to determine if a hostile environment existed. The second was the level of injury a complainant must suffer in order to have standing to make a claim of hostile environment harassment. Both of those issues were addressed in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> worked for an equipment rental company. During the course of her employment, the company president made several statements to her, such as "you're a woman, what do you know" and "we need a man as the rental manager," and called her a "dumb ass woman." He also suggested, in front of others, that they go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate her raise. In addition, he made sexual innuendos about the plaintiff and other female employees. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee found for the employer. The District Court found that, while some of the comments offended the plaintiff and would have offended a reasonable woman, the work environment created was not so severe that it would seriously affect the plaintiff's psychological well-being. The District Court further found that the plaintiff herself was not so seriously offended that she suffered psychological injury. In finding that the plaintiff was required to establish severe psychological injury in a hostile environment sexual harassment claim, the District Court was following the lead of several courts of appeals. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the decision in a brief, unpublished opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">It took the Supreme Court less than four weeks after oral argument to issue its decision. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice O'Connor, the <span class="Italic">Harris</span> Court, 114 S. Ct. at 370-71, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]hen the workplace is permeated with "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,"...that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment,"...Title VII is violated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we pointed out in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, "mere utterance of an...epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee,"...does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment, and there is no Title VII violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees' psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees' job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII's broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct alleged in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, and the reference in that case to environments "'so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,'" <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 66, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct "seriously affect[ed] plaintiff's psychological well-being" <span id="Page_813"></span>or led her to "suffe[r] injury." Such an inquiry may needlessly focus the factfinder's attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not require. So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 67, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a concurring opinion, Justice Scalia noted that he believed the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> did little to guide factfinders in determining whether a work environment is sexually hostile. But in a comment on the draftsmanship of Congress, he concluded, "I know of no test more faithful to the inherently vague statutory language than the one the Court today adopts."</p>
<p class="noindent">In sum, <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris</span> established that a plaintiff may demonstrate the existence of a hostile work environment by showing she was subjected to unwelcome sexual advances, requests, comments, or physical conduct that were so severe or pervasive as to affect job performance or create an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment. Whether a particular environment is hostile is determined by using a test with both an objective and a subjective prong. First, the conduct must be severe or pervasive enough that a reasonable person would view the environment as hostile, offensive or abusive. Second, the plaintiff must actually have perceived the environment as such, which is simply another way of saying that the conduct must be unwelcome.</p>
