<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-95"><span class="space">C.</span> THE "CLEAR AND CONVINCING" STANDARD</h3>
<p class="noindent">As noted <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the clear and convincing evidence standard is adopted in 29 CFR 1614.501(b) as the burden placed upon an agency, at the relief stage of a proceeding, to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination and, therefore, the complainant is not entitled to full relief. The clear and convincing standard places a heavy burden of persuasion upon the agency. In <span class="Italic">Bates v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01924457 (1993), the Commission defined that burden:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First and foremost, the Commission notes that, where discrimination has been established, the agency bears the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that appellant's qualifications were such that he would not have been selected absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">Day v. Mathews</span>, 530 F.2d 1083, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1976). <span class="Italic">See also</span> EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.271. Clear and convincing proof is generally defined as proof beyond a reasonable, i.e., a well founded doubt. BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 227 (5th ed. 1979). The standard has been more fully defined as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">That measure of degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a preponderance but not to the extent of such certainty as is required to be beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When examining the challenged nonselection, the respective qualifications of the selectee and appellant are dispositive. Thus, if appellant's qualifications are as good or better than the selectee's qualifications, the agency has failed to sustain its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the appellant would not have been selected absent discrimination. Similarly, if the selectee possesses measurably better qualifications than appellant, then the agency has typically met its burden. Further, the purpose of Title VII is to relieve employees and applicants from the effects of employment discrimination and to implement remedies which will enable the affected parties to attain and maintain their rightful place in the work environment. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 421 (1975). "Rightful place" is defined as the position an aggrieved applicant or employee would have held but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co.</span>, 494 F.2d 211, 7 FEP Cases 1115, 1144 (5th Cir. 1974). While these principles were first enunciated in cases from the private sector, they apply equally to the federal government in its relations with its own employees. <span class="Italic">Arnold v. United States Postal Service</span>, 649 F. Supp 676 (D.D.C. 1986); <span class="Italic">Loeb v. Textron, Inc.</span>, 600 F.2d 1003 (1st Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to effectuate these objectives and goals, the Commission is empowered to require the retroactive job placement of a victim of unlawful discrimination. 29 CFR 1613.271(a)(3). Under federal regulations, an identified victim of discrimination, such as appellant, is usually entitled to an "immediate and unconditional offer of placement. . .to the position the discriminatee would have occupied absent discrimination, or to a substantially equivalent position, even if the placement of the discriminatee results in the displacement of another of respondent's employees." Section (3), Appendix A to Part 1613--Policy Statement on Remedies and Relief for Individual Cases of Unlawful Discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have explained the purpose for shifting the burden to the employer after discrimination has been proven: (I)t is unreasonable and destructive to the purposes of Title VII to require the plaintiff to establish in addition to proving the discrimination the difficult hypothetical proposition that, had there been no discrimination, the employment decision would have been made in favor of appellant. We chose to instead place the burden upon the employer to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the unlawful factor was not the determinative factor. <span class="Italic">Toney v. Block</span>, 705 F.2d 1364, 1366 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">"'Clear and convincing proof' is defined as 'that proof which results in reasonable certainty of the truth of the ultimate fact in controversy.' Black's Law Dictionary 251 (6th ed. 1990)." <span class="Italic">Mahran v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05940973 <span id="Page_774"></span>(1996). In meeting that burden of proof, the administrative judge may not rely on the testimony of a selecting official whose testimony was deemed not credible on the underlying issue of Title VII liability. "While a particular witness clearly may be deemed to be credible on some points and not others, we find that the testimony upon which the finding of retaliation by the AJ in this case rested, which concerned the SO's working relationship with appellant <span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> the selectee, was too intimately related to the remaining ostensible reasons for the nonselection (leadership and performance as viewed through the SO's working relationship with the candidates) not to affect the credibility of the remainder of the SO's testimony." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Windham v. Secretary of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration</span>, 01933164 (1994), the Commission gave some additional guidance on the "clear and convincing" standard. In that case and a companion case, <span class="Italic">Ball v. Secretary of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration</span>, 01933092 (1994), the Commission found the agency selected a clearly less-qualified candidate on the basis of her sex. In separate decisions, after a consolidated hearing, the administrative judge determined that both complainants were victims of discrimination. On the issue of clear and convincing evidence, in <span class="Italic">Ball</span> the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When examining the challenged nonselection, the respective qualifications of the candidates and appellant are dispositive. Thus, if the appellant's qualifications are as good or better than the other candidate's qualifications, the agency has failed to sustain its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that appellant would not have been selected absent discrimination. Similarly, if the other candidates possess measurably better qualifications than appellant, then the agency has typically met its burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, given a fair evaluation of the experience of the candidates, it cannot be said that appellant would not have been selected. Specifically, the record does not contain evidence that the other candidates possessed measurably better qualifications than appellant. Further, the SO never provided any additional rationale for reevaluating the candidates and ranking certain candidates higher than appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Commission finds that the agency has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that appellant would not have been selected for the position of Hearing Officer, even absent discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that, in a selection case, it is the examination of the respective qualifications of the selectee and the complainant that are dispositive on the issue of the agency's clear and convincing burden. In <span class="Italic">Chika v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01934179 (1994), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[N]ow that discrimination has been found, the agency bears the burden of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant's qualifications are such that he would not have been selected for the position at issue even absent discrimination<span class="Italic">. Day v. Matthews</span>, 530 F.2d 1083, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Bates v. Dept. of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924457 (March 31, 1993). "Clear and convincing evidence" is defined as "that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required to be beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 227 (5th ed. 1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When examining a challenged nonselection, the respective qualifications of the selectee and the aggrieved individual, appellant herein, are dispositive. If appellant's qualifications are as good or better than Selectee's, the agency has failed to sustain its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that appellant would not have been selected absent discrimination. However, if Selectee has measurably better qualifications than appellant, the agency has met its burden. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Patterson v. USDA</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932193 (September 21, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, a review of the respective qualifications of appellant and Selectee supports a finding that Selectee is measurably better qualified than appellant. Even leaving aside the criterion of "presentability," for which Selectee received much credit, Selectee plainly better meets the criteria derived from the position description; these criteria were applied to all applicants. As an example, Selectee has work-related experience in overhead budgeting, while appellant's experience is limited to planning the family budget. Likewise, Selectee has work-related experience in master planning, while appellant's experience is limited to planning the use of a small parcel of land he owns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that while the evidence supports a finding of discrimination based on national origin, the evidence further supports a finding that appellant would not have been selected for the position at issue even in the absence of such discrimination. Accordingly, appellant is not entitled to any individual relief<span class="Italic">. Tucker v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 0591009 (April 12, 1991). However, the agency is obliged to take steps to eliminate discriminatory practices, as ordered by the Commission, <span class="Italic">infra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the <span class="Italic">Chika</span> complaint predated the 1991 Civil Rights Act and the complainant was, therefore, not entitled to remedies such as attorney fees. However, on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Chika v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950148 (1996), the Commission found that irregularities in the selection process required the agency to give the complainant priority consideration for the next position, and to grant him attorney fees. The legal basis for the decision is unclear. But in ordering a remedy of priority consideration for the complainant, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Chika</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission agrees with the previous decision that the selection process was conducted in an irregular manner. The Commission further finds that appellant was clearly among the best qualified candidates considered for the supervisory position. While the previous decision found that the selectee appeared to have been better qualified than appellant, the tainted nature of the selection process throws into question whether appellant's qualifications were properly weighed. In rendering its decision in this matter, the Commission considers the fact that appellant's request for reconsideration did not challenge the previous decision's finding that he would not have been selected for the position in question in any event. Thus, the Commission finds that under the specific circumstances of this case and in light of the irregular selection process, in addition to the relief ordered in the previous decision, the agency is required to give appellant priority consideration to the next supervisory GS-13 vacancy position for which appellant qualifies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found the foregoing relief appropriate in this matter, the Commission further finds that appellant, having received individual relief, is a prevailing party in this matter and is entitled to attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05950960 (1998), further clarified the issue of an agency's liability defense for failure to select a complainant to focus on the actual point in time at which the discrimination occurred. The Commission found that the agency in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> failed to show that the complainant would not have been selected, absent discrimination, where it argued the qualifications of the selectee were better. The Commission noted that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> never actually competed with the selectee. Instead, the complainant was deemed unqualified for the position. As a result, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to limit its liability, the agency must demonstrate that it "would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor. . . ." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). The prior decision, in concluding that appellant would not have been selected even absent the discrimination, emphasized the fact that the Selectee was better qualified than appellant. What is apparent from the record, however, is that appellant and the Selectee never actually competed against one another. In this regard, it was not until after the SO had found appellant unqualified for the Position (thereby bypassing the requirement that she select him pursuant to his Veteran's Preference status) that the Selectee became eligible for consideration. Therefore, we find that whether or not the Selectee was better qualified than appellant is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Commission concludes that, had appellant been found qualified for the Position, he would have been selected due to his Veteran's Preference status. Therefore, the relevant question is whether the agency has demonstrated that, absent the SO's discriminatory considerations, appellant would still have been found unqualified. We find the agency has not made such a showing, the primary reason being that the SO, in finding appellant unqualified, discounted his many years of social work experience due to its religious context. In this regard, the Commission finds that the decision to disqualify appellant was so interrelated with his religious background as to preclude a finding that the agency would still have found him unqualified absent discriminatory considerations. Accordingly, it is the decision of the Commission to grant appellant's request for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1991 Civil Rights Act now provides for some degree of relief in mixed motive cases, even where the employer succeeds in proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it was also motivated by legitimate factors. Pursuant to 42 USC 2000e-2(m):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Except as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsection B of 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2) further provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On a claim in which the individual proves a violation under section 703(m) and a respondent demonstrates that the respondent would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, the court--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief (except as provided in clause (ii), and attorney's fees and costs demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under section 703(m); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;shall not award damages of issue an order requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_775"></span>The word "demonstrate" as used in the Act means "meets the burdens of production and persuasion." 42 USC 2000e(m).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a discriminating official has been found to be a wholly incredible witness, it is unlikely his testimony will be sufficient to demonstrate that the agency would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Bergmann v. Attorney General</span>, 05960429 (1997), the Commission found that the administrative judge's determination that the appellant would have been terminated even in the absence of discrimination was erroneous where it was based solely on testimony of the alleged discriminating official, who the judge determined to be an incredible witness. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bergmann</span> reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the previous decision, as well as in the AJ's recommended decision, the remedy is reduced to notice posting and attorney's fees because there were ostensibly legitimate reasons for removing appellant, apart from the discriminatory reasons. Specifically, it was noted in the previous decision that appellant did not cooperate or cooperated reluctantly with regard to: (1) evening work hours, (2) provision of and scheduling emergency services, (3) coordinating a student practicum, (4) preparing waiver requests, (5) wearing a pager, and (6) scheduling leave during a critical period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes, however, that these reasons were all obtained from appellant's supervisor, who was found not only to be an incredible witness, but who also was the source of the discriminatory comments made in this case. The Commission finds that the testimony of this witness is inherently unbelievable, and therefore, we conclude that absent other evidence supporting appellant's supervisor's view, it is improbable that the agency would have taken the same action against appellant in the absence of discrimination. . . .Considering the credibility findings made by the AJ, and considering the other evidence of record which fails to substantiate the agency's charges, the Commission finds that the agency has not shown that, absent the discrimination, it would have removed appellant. Once again, we emphasize that the decision to remove appellant was based largely upon the recommendation of appellant's supervisor. Inasmuch as this individual was the source of the discriminatory comments made, and given that there is no other objective evidence supporting the agency's position that appellant made unreasonable requests for a probationary employee, and did not abide by agency rules and regulations, the Commission finds that the remedy provided in the previous decision must be expanded to include that outlined in the order below. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission ordered<span class="Italic"> inter alia</span>, reinstatement, back pay, and attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hassan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955052 (1997), the agency sought to avoid liability by arguing that appellant would have been removed in any event because of a safety infraction and his failure on one occasion to deliver some parcels. The administrative judge noted that these matters were not deemed significant enough to be brought to the attention of appellant's first-line supervisor, nor were they included in his evaluations. The Commission agreed that this evidence was insufficient to establish that the appellant would have been removed, especially given the agency's failure to remove another employee for similar infractions.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, misconduct cases present some of the best opportunities for agencies to satisfy the clear and convincing standard, provided there is a demonstration that the complainant has actually engaged in the misconduct and the penalty is reasonable. For example, in <span class="Italic">Moslak v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990659 (2002), the agency was able to satisfy the clear and convincing standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The substantial evidence of record supports the AJ's finding of direct evidence of reprisal discrimination as to the January 11, 1996 settlement agreement discussion regarding the dropping of a future suspension for the withdrawal of two active EEO complaints. The AJ properly found evidence of a clear motive of reprisal with the January 12, 1996 marking of the complainant as AWOL for the December 22 incident and the issuance of the 14-day suspension on January 24, 1996. It is undisputed that the settlement agreement discussion, wherein the offer to avoid a suspension if she dropped her two active EEOs, was held on January 11, 1996. The complainant testified that she would not accept any such deal to drop her EEOs in lieu of receiving a suspension. Hearing Transcript (HT), Volume I at 171. Record evidence shows that the leave slip marking the complainant AWOL was dated January 12, 1996, just one day after the settlement discussion and twelve days later, the complainant's 14-day suspension was issued by letter dated January 24, 1996. We find substantial evidence to support the AJ's findings that the agency's actions after the January 11, 1996 settlement discussion were motivated by reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also supports a finding that even without the discriminatory motive, the agency would have both marked her AWOL and that the next progressive discipline was a 14-day suspension. HT, Volume I at 202, 204, 277 and 287. Finally, the record does not support the complainant's general contentions that a replacement AJ prior to the hearing or a remand order for the agency to clarify the claims accepted and rejected, irreparably injured her case. Moreover, we note that the complainant's representative is not an attorney; therefore, she is not entitled to attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cases such as this in which there is a finding that discrimination was one of multiple motivating factors for an employment action, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> in which the agency acted on both lawful and unlawful reasons, are known as "mixed motive" cases. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), an employer could avoid liability in mixed motive cases if it could show that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful factor<span class="Italic">. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 490 (1989). However, the CRA effectively overruled the part of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> that allowed an employer to avoid liability in this way. The CRA added Section 703(m) to Title VII, making it clear that a violation is established when a complaining party demonstrates that "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." 42 USC 2000e-2(m). Once a complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. If the agency is able to make this demonstration, the complainant is not entitled to personal relief, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or back pay, but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees or costs<span class="Italic">. See Walker v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980504 (April 8, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record in its entirety, including consideration of all statements submitted on appeal, it is the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to REVERSE the final agency decision, because the Administrative Judge's ultimate finding, that unlawful employment discrimination was proven by a preponderance of the evidence, is supported by the record.<span id="Page_776"></span></p>
