<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-136"><span class="space">a.</span> Fitness-For-Duty Examinations Found Permissible</h5>
<p class="noindent">If an agency lawfully orders an employee to report for a fitness-for-duty examination, it may also lawfully suspend the employee for failing to attend the examination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gribcheck v. Postmaster General</span>, 03A20068 (2003), the Commission found the agency was justified in sending the employee to a fitness-for-duty examination where there was conflicting evidence over his potential for violence and that the agency properly placed him in a nonpay status when he refused to submit to the examination.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency has sufficient reason to believe that an employee may be a risk to herself or someone else, a fitness-for-duty examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity. In <span class="Italic">Lee v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120063870 (2007), the Commission found that the agency was justified in ordering a fitness-for-duty examination where the complainant signed a petition complaining about management and, as a result, the agency replaced several managers. Shortly after the complainant was given a supervisory assignment, she became frustrated and told her manager that she had become so distraught that she had thoughts of harming herself and leaving behind a note blaming the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">A fitness-for-duty examination was warranted, as was a subsequent suspension for failing to attend the examination, where the complainant, a letter carrier, accused coworkers of conspiring against him, reported that he heard voices and told coworkers he carried a gun. In <span class="Italic">Domingo v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120092031 (2011), the Commission found that the agency had a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that the complainant posed a threat to himself or someone else. Because the examination was justified, the Commission also found that the agency had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for suspending the complainant for failing to report to the exam. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130214 (2013) (complainant made statements that customer was letting dog loose on him on instructions from agency management and agency had a monitoring chip placed in his tooth).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Platt v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01996724 (2002), the Commission found the complainant's aberrant behavior, coupled with information received from the agency's doctor, provided the agency with a reasonable basis for making further medical inquiries. In that case, the complainant used inappropriate and profane language, became upset and walked out of a meeting and made a statement to a Vietnamese coworker about feeling like he was in Viet Nam again. The Commission held the agency had a reasonable belief that the complainant posed a danger to himself or others and that further medical inquiries were lawful. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cashdollar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50828 (2006) (agency had reasonable belief where driver told supervisor he suffered anxiety and panic attacks, heard voices and his medication had adverse side effects); <span class="Italic">Crowley v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A51402 (2006) (examination justified where in a meeting complainant resigned abruptly, rambled for at least an hour, appeared manic and insinuated that some employees were evil); <span class="Italic">Fernandez-Guerra v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a45206.txt">01A45206</a> (2005) (examination justified where employee received notice of proposed removal for exposing self, 14-day suspension for an altercation and made a threat to kill someone); <span class="Italic">Grimes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02459 (2002) (a fitness-for-duty examination was warranted based on agency observations that the complainant concocted an elaborate story regarding an absence, began dressing differently, staring at coworkers and not speaking to them, making suicidal comments and walking out in front of moving equipment); <span class="Italic">Wright v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12209 (2002) (agency observations combined with employee's request for six months of FMLA leave formed reasonable belief for fitness-for-duty examination); <span class="Italic">O'Malley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994945 (2002) (examination warranted based on three-page memo from supervisor detailing changes in complainant's personality and behavior).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120133021 (2015), the Commission found that a fitness-for-duty examination was warranted where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he record reveals that S1 requested that Complainant attend an FFDE based on her and others' observation of Complainant's behavior, including road rage incidents, an incident in which Complainant was discovered following his relief carrier on his day off, and fellow carriers witnessing Complainant unnecessarily jamming mail into mailboxes to the point that he cut his hands. ROI, Exs. 6, 7. The record contains numerous complaints about Complainant's unsafe behavior and history of reckless driving from co-workers, customers, and local police. ROI, Ex. 15. The Commission finds that there was nothing unlawful about the FFDE as the Agency has established that S1 ordered the FFDE based upon objective evidence that Complainant may have been unfit to operate a Postal vehicle and therefore unable to perform the essential functions of his job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120050086 (2007), the Commission found that the agency was justified in seeking two fitness-for-duty examinations on the complainant. Note that to the extent that the complainant also alleged the exams were motivated on a discriminatory or retaliatory basis, the Commission found that the agency had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for ordering the exams. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation, we find that the agency provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. Specifically, the agency stated that complainant was directed to undergo the first FFDE because supervisors had reported that complainant refused to communicate verbally with management, engaged in emotional outbursts in which he was teary and walked off the job, exhibited a paranoid perception that management was "out to get him," and refused to comply with instructions. In the report for the first examination, the physician stated that he believed complainant suffered from depression with delusional features but noted that diagnosis was difficult because complainant was "extremely guarded and suspicious" during the examination. The physician determined that complainant was fit for duty only if he received counseling from the agency's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and psychotherapy from his medical provider in which he is evaluated on a longitudinal basis for three to four visits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1233"></span>The physician testified that complainant's demeanor was "more aggressive, more suspicious, overly suspicious-acting" during the second examination. The FFDE report stated that complainant displayed facial disdain, had a rigid posture, and at times was aggressive during the examination. The report recommended that complainant receive supportive psychotherapy and medication for paranoia within two months of the examination and should be reevaluated in June 2000 to ensure that he was in treatment. The report concluded that if complainant did not receive the recommended treatment, he would pose a danger to the office. The physician testified that he believed that complainant could be treated "readily and easily," but without treatment complainant should not return to work because he had dangerous delusions that agency management was trying to harm him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency maintained that it held a meeting on May 24, 2000 with complainant and in a letter dated June 6, 2000, it informed complainant that he must seek psychotherapy through his medical provider and submit a progress report from his treating physician within 60 days. The agency maintained that after complainant's physician maintained that he was fit for duty in June 2000, it suggested that complainant obtain a third opinion from another physician. The agency contended that it removed complainant because he refused to comply with its conditions for continued employment and seek a third physician's opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that the conclusions of the agency's contract physician contradicted the findings of his personal physician. However, we determine that the agency's reliance on eyewitness reports and the FFDE report is reasonable and does not reflect any discriminatory animus in this case. Complainant further argues that the agency violated various provisions of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) regarding FFDE's and contract physicians, but we determine that these provisions are mostly inapplicable in this case because they concern occupational injuries. Moreover, enforcement of ELM provisions is beyond the scope of the EEO process. We find that complainant failed to provide any persuasive evidence that the reasons articulated by the agency were pretext for unlawful discrimination. Consequently, we find that the AJ properly found no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that the agency improperly required him to undergo fitness for duty examinations in March 1999 and April 2000. The Rehabilitation Act allows employers to make disability-related inquiries or require medical examinations of employees only if it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 14(c). Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee may be "job-related and consistent with business necessity" when an employer "has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition." <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance--Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span>, see text after question 4 (July 26, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ found that the agency demonstrated that its decision to require complainant to undergo a March 1999 FFDE was "job-related and consistent with business necessity" because it was based on objective evidence that complainant could not perform the essential functions of his position because of an impairment, i.e., the accounts of agency officials and co-workers who testified that they directly observed complainant's non-communication, emotional outbursts, and refusal to follow supervisors' direct orders. The AJ further determined that complainant's August 30, 1999 letter to a manager in which he stated that he had "developed a phobia about meeting with any maintenance management in their offices" and the AJ's observations of complainant's demeanor during the hearing confirmed that the agency's observations were reasonable. The AJ further found that it was reasonable that the agency wanted to follow-up on complainant's prognosis with a subsequent FFDE in April 2000, given complainant's prior behavior and the results and recommendations of the March 1999 FFDE. Upon review, we conclude that the AJ properly found that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it ordered complainant to undergo examinations because the AJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Attorney General</span>, 0120053581 (2007), the agency was found to be justified in its initial fitness-for-duty examination, which resulted in the complainant being placed on leave, and a subsequent examination prior to his clearance for return to work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that after complainant told him that he was stressed in December 2000, complainant's condition appeared to deteriorate. S1 stated that in March 2001, complainant informed him that he that he had an "emotional breakdown" where he cried uncontrollably at home for hours. "He told me that he locked up his gun--he's required to carry a gun as an 1811--and that he is not a threat to himself or anybody else, but just in an abundance of caution he locked that up, and his wife would know the steps he had to go through to get to that and would be able to inform somebody," he stated. Complainant stated that although he rarely carried a weapon to work prior to March 2001, all special agents were authorized to possess a firearm. S1 stated that he consulted Employee Assistant Program officials, who told him that complainant's condition was "alarming," and discussed the matter with management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 29, 2001, the agency ordered complainant to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination (FFDE) with the agency's Suitability Review Protocol. Consistent with agency policy, complainant was placed on administrative leave until he was declared fit for duty. In April 2001, a contract psychiatrist and contract psychologist evaluated complainant and found that complainant was unfit for service as a special agent. The evaluation diagnosed complainant with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression and recommended that complainant continue weekly psychotherapy and medication management. The evaluation further recommended that complainant be reevaluated in three months, but complainant was not reevaluated at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a letter dated September 6, 2001, complainant's personal physician informed the agency that complainant's condition was "much improved" and stated that complainant was able to return to work and perform the full range of duties of his detail position. In November 2001, the agency agreed to return complainant to work with the stipulations that he continue treatment with physicians, provide updates on his condition every thirty days, allow agency officials to consult with complainant's personal physician, and continue medication as long as necessary. Complainant balked at some of the agency's terms and negotiated. In February 2002, complainant agreed to allow the agency to contact his personal physicians, and the agency agreed to return complainant to duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the agency's directive for complainant to undergo a FFDE was "job-related and consistent with business necessity" because it was based on objective evidence that complainant could not perform the essential functions of his position or posed a direct threat because of an impairment, i.e., complainant's report to management that he was experiencing significant job-related stress and had exhibited signs of severe emotional distress. We further determine that the agency properly sought to ascertain that complainant was indeed fit to return for duty before returning him to work after the agency's contract physician determined that he was unfit for duty. While the process of returning complainant to work was protracted because of negotiations regarding the terms of his return, we find that, under the circumstances, the terms offered by the agency were also "job-related and consistent with business necessity." Consequently, we conclude that the AJ properly found that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it ordered complainant to undergo a FFDE and placed him on administrative leave until he was found fit for duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Effective March 21, 2002, the agency authorized complainant to return to work, but the agency reassigned complainant from his detail position to the position of Staff Coordinator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that this reassignment into a non-supervisory position constitutes direct evidence of discrimination because the agency returned him to a less prestigious position. Complainant had been serving on detail. There is nothing in the record to establish that complainant was entitled to return to this detail position after his extended absence. The agency returned him to the office where he worked prior to his detail assignment. We disagree that this is direct evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's second line supervisor in the Office of Investigative Technology (S2), stated that complainant was reassigned from his detail position because he had been out of work for almost a year and was replaced by another employee who was doing very well in the supervisory position. S2 also stated that reassigning complainant was prudent in this case because complainant had failed to properly supervise an employee who failed to properly make agency credit card payments, and the replacement supervisor had rectified the situation. We find that complainant failed to offer any persuasive evidence from which it could be reasonably concluded that the agency's reasons for reassigning complainant were pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. Therefore, we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding this issue, and the AJ properly found no discrimination.</p>

<p class="noindent">A fitness-for-duty examination was warranted in <span class="Italic">Addison v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120081932 (2011), where the complainant, a licensed practical nurse, told her supervisor she was concerned about returning to full duties because she feared caring for patients. Although the complainant disputed the facts, the supervisor said the complainant told him that she was having blackouts, dizziness and memory loss. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ike D. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120162134 (2018) (no violation of the Rehabilitation Act where the complainant, a social worker whose duties including transporting veterans to <span id="Page_1234"></span>and from the facility, had a propensity to become tired at work and admitted that he asked management what they would do if someone in his position would hurt themselves, which management took as a reference to suicide and referred the complainant for a FFDE).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a nurse who administered medications occasionally took pain medications for a back condition, the agency's order of a fitness-for-duty examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity. In <span class="Italic">Hill v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120054529 (2007), the Commission rejected the complainant's argument that she had not injured any patients, finding "a mistake by an impaired Nurse could have serious implications for a patient."</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Rico M. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120160238 (2018), a Records Conversion Specialist, reported to his supervisor that he had been diagnosed with PTSD. Thereafter, the agency required that the complainant submit to a fitness for duty exam. The results of that examination led to the suspension of the complainant's security clearance, and ultimately, his being place on administrative leave. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Rico M.</span> relied on the complainant's own admissions to find the examination was permissible, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency had a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that Complainant, because of his PTSD condition, might not have been able to safely perform the essential functions of his job and/or that he posed a direct threat to himself and others. Specifically, the record reflects that Complainant's condition caused him difficulty sleeping, anxiety, difficulty focusing, and poor short term memory. According to Complainant, the condition made it "difficult for [him] to do [his] job." For this reason, he explained his condition to his supervisors. ROI Exhibit 9. Complainant's affidavit testimony shows that his medical condition interfered with his ability to perform the essential functions of his position. The circumstances of this case support the Agency's action of requiring him to undergo a fitness for duty examination and subsequently placing him on administrative leave. Accordingly, we find that the Agency's actions did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">A fitness-for-duty examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity when an employee, whose job duties include shuttling agency vehicles, reports to work twice smelling of alcohol. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33280.txt">01A33280</a> (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is justified in requiring an employee to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination where his failure to maintain proper blood sugar results in his nearly fainting and being unable to perform his duties. The attack that prompted the fitness-for-duty examination was preceded by at least two similar attacks. Moreover, the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Head v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12349 (2002), that the agency also was justified in placing the complainant on emergency leave status where two physicians disagreed as to whether the complainant's post-traumatic stress disorder rendered him totally disabled:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we address the agency's actions in requiring complainant to undergo FFD examination. As noted by the AJ, the Commission has held that medical examinations are allowed during employment when such examinations are job-related and consistent with business necessity<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance--Disability Related Inquiries), No. 915.002 (July 26, 2000); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span> (March 25, 1997); and EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Preemployment Disability-Related Questions</span> (October 10, 1995). The Rehabilitation Act does not limit the prohibitions against improper medical inquiries or improper disclosure of confidential medical information, to individuals with disabilities. 29 C.F.R. 1630.14(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Medical inquiries or examinations are permitted if they address reasonable concerns about whether an individual is fit to perform the essential functions of his or her position without posing a direct threat<span class="Italic">. See Verzelini v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972586 (June 21, 1999). It is the burden of the employer to show that its disability-related inquiries and requests for examination are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Disability-Related Inquiries, at 15-23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record indicates that the agency sent complainant for a FFD examination after complainant had an attack of low blood sugar resulting in his nearly fainting and being unable to perform his duties as a window clerk. This episode of low blood sugar occurred after at least two similar attacks, apparently due to complainant's failure to eat or take insulin as instructed by his physician. The AJ found that the agency management sent complainant for the FFD examination because of their reasonable belief, following complainant's low blood sugar attack on June 4, 1997, that he could not perform the essential functions of his position. Further, we find that the record reflects that facility management reasonably sent complainant for the psychological examination to resolve the conflict between complainant's personal physician and the agency's examining physician regarding whether complainant was 100 percent disabled due to his PTSD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to complainant's placement in the emergency off-duty status, the PM believed that there was a "reasonable cause to believe that retaining [complainant] in a duty status may result in damage to U.S. Postal Service property, loss of mail funds or where [complainant] may be injurious to self or others." Investigative Report, at 101. The AJ issued a finding of fact that the agency's requirement that complainant undergo the FFD examinations and its placement of complainant in an emergency off-duty status pending the results of such examinations was "justified by the number and frequency of complainant's low blood sugar attacks prior to his referral." AJ's Decision at 18. Upon review of the record and the AJ's findings of fact, we conclude that the agency met its burden of showing that the required medical examinations and placement of complainant in an off-duty status were job-related and consistent with business necessity. In addition, we note that there is no evidence in the record that the agency ordered the medical examinations or placed complainant on an off-duty status due to an animus toward his diabetes or PTSD. Accordingly, we find that the medical examinations and placement in off-duty status did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, the Commission found that when a law enforcement officer who was diabetic experienced episodes of combativeness and confusion, the agency was justified in ordering a fitness-for-duty examination. In <span class="Italic">Arroyo v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A21863 (2003), the Commission held that the agency's actions in ordering the examination and relieving the complainant of his firearm would have been warranted for anyone exhibiting his behavior, without regard to disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">A fitness-for-duty examination is lawful where the employee provides medical information on the effects of medication he is taking, but the agency determines the information is lacking in specificity. In <span class="Italic">Calicott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01169 (2003), the Commission found the agency was justified in seeking a fitness-for-duty examination where the employee informed his supervisor that the medication he was taking may cause drowsiness. The employee then provided a letter from his physician indicating the medication should not cause problems when taken at therapeutic levels. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Calicott</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the agency sent complainant for a fitness-for-duty examination after complainant informed his supervisor, for, as he indicated, safety reasons, that he had taken medication that may cause drowsiness or blurred vision when taken. At the time of this incident complainant had no restrictions on record. The record indicates that since complainant indicated that it may be hazardous for him to perform his duties, Postal Service Regulation ELM 864.32, required that he be sent for a fitness-for-duty examination. The record reveals that on April 16, 1997, complainant's physician provided a letter indicating that at therapeutic doses, he would not expect to find any central nervous system effects. The physician indicated that he had "not placed any limitations on complainant's activity including, such activities as driving, bending, climbing ladders and so forth." The letter continued that if complainant began having any of these mentioned problems "I would think it would be unlikely to be related to taking Lomotil at therapeutic dosages." Following receipt of this information, the agency scheduled a fitness-for-duty examination for complainant to take place on April 30, 1997. The results of the April 30, 1997, exam found that complainant was medically qualified to perform the essential functions of his position without accommodation and with no limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that based on the physician's letter, there was a sufficient basis for the agency to seek clarification regarding complainant's medical status. We find the information provided by the physician was lacking in relevant facts and did not provide information regarding complainant's current medical condition, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> whether or not he had experienced blurred vision or drowsiness while taking the medication. As such, the April 30, 1997, fitness-for-duty examination was lawful. We find that the agency has met its burden of showing that the examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity. Accordingly, we find that the examination was not a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">A summary opinion from the complainant's psychiatrist that the complainant no longer poses a threat to others may not be sufficient to permit an employee to return to work. Particularly, where there is no indication that the employee's doctor knows the requirements of the position, the agency may be justified in seeking a fitness-for-duty examination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bolgrin v. Attorney General</span>, 01A21059 (2003), the complainant's advised the agency that his doctor recommended he take seven days of sick leave because of job-related stress. Ultimately, that was extended to five weeks of leave. The Commission determined that a subsequent letter from the complainant's psychiatrist noting that he was no longer a threat to individuals in the prison environment did not make a subsequent fitness-for-duty examination a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Under the circumstances, the Commission found that the agency had a reasonable belief that the complainant's job abilities might be impaired.</p>
