<h3 class="h3" id="sec20-68"><span class="space">M.</span> JUDICIAL REVIEW IN MIXED CASES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Like virtually everything else involving mixed cases, judicial review is a complex subject. Because of the trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> provisions of Title VII there is no judicial review of EEOC federal sector decisions. Complainants dissatisfied with the results in the EEO administrative process have the right to file a civil action in U.S. district court. 5 USC 7702(e)(1); 7703(b)(2). On the other hand, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from MSPB decisions. 5 USC 7703(b)(1)(A). However, the Federal Circuit has no jurisdiction to review MSPB findings on discrimination claims raised as an affirmative defense because of the trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> provisions of Title VII and the Civil Service Reform Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an MSPB decision decides claims of discrimination and the appellant wishes to pursue both the discrimination claims and any claims of error under Title V, the proper course is to file a civil action in U.S. district court. The district court then acts as a trial court for the discrimination claims and an appellate court on any Title VII claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Kelliher v. Veneman</span>, 313 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">There was a split in the circuits over the proper court when the MSPB dismissed an appeal that raised an affirmative defense of discrimination on procedural grounds. Some courts found that, as a purely procedural matter, the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction over such appeals. Other courts found that the Title VII trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> provisions vested jurisdiction in the U.S. district courts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596 (December 10, 2012), the Supreme Court found that jurisdiction in such cases lies with the appropriate geographic U.S. district court and not the Federal Circuit even where the MSPB's dismissal of the case is on procedural grounds. The precise procedural history of the <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> case is complex and, suffice it to say, not particularly relevant to the outcome of the case except to the extent that the MSPB dismissed her mixed case appeal on procedural grounds and she sought review in U.S. district court. The district court dismissed the action on jurisdictional grounds and the Eighth Circuit agreed that the Federal Circuit was the exclusive forum for MSPB appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 639 F.3d 834 (8th Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">Writing for a unanimous Court in an opinion not without its humor, Justice Kagan explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the above account reveals, the intersection of federal civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced a complicated, at times confusing, process for resolving claims of discrimination in the federal workplace. But even within the most intricate and complex systems, some things are plain. So it is in this case, where two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeckner to district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Begin with &#x00A7; 7703, which governs judicial review of the MSPB's rulings. As already noted, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, at 3-4, &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Board's final decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit--"[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection." Paragraph (2), i.e., &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), then sets out a different rule for one category of cases--"[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title." Such a case, paragraph (2) instructs, "shall be filed under" the enforcement provision of an enumerated antidiscrimination statute. And each of those enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 3-4. So "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702" shall be filed in district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turn next to &#x00A7; 7702, which identifies the cases "subject to [its] provisions." As also stated earlier, &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) describes cases in which a federal employee "(A) has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and (B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by" a listed federal statute. The subsection thus describes what we (adopting the lingo of the applicable regulations) have called "mixed cases." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302. Those are the "cases of discrimination subject to" the rest of &#x00A7; 7702's provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Now just put &#x00A7; 7703 and &#x00A7; 7702 together--say, in the form of a syllogism, to make the point obvious. Under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), "cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702]" shall be filed in district court. Under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), the "cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702]" are mixed cases--those appealable to the MSPB and alleging discrimination. Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And so that is where Kloeckner's case should have been filed (as indeed it was). No one here contests that Kloeckner brought a mixed case--that she was affected by an action (i.e., removal) appealable to the MSPB and that she alleged discrimination prohibited by an enumerated federal law. And under the CSRA's terms, that is all that matters. Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or instead threw it out as untimely, Kloeckner brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes, in crystalline fashion, to district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Government offers an alternative view (as did the Eighth Circuit)--that the CSRA directs the MSPB's merits decisions to district court, while channeling its procedural rulings to the Federal Circuit. According to the Government, that bifurcated scheme, though not prescribed in the CSRA in so many words, lies hidden in the statute's timing requirements. But we return from the Government's mazelike tour of the CSRA persuaded only that the merits-procedure distinction is a contrivance, found nowhere in the statute's provisions on judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Government's argument has two necessary steps. First, the Government claims that &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction applies only when the MSPB's decision in a mixed case is a "judicially reviewable action" under &#x00A7; 7702. Second, the Government asserts that the Board's dismissal of a mixed case on procedural grounds does not qualify as such a "judicially reviewable action." We describe in turn the way the Government arrives at each of these conclusions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first step of the Government's argument derives from &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s second sentence. Right after stating that "cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702]" shall be filed under specified antidiscrimination statutes (i.e., shall be filed in district court), &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) provides: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed under any such [statute] must be filed within 30 days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action under section 7702." The Government reads that sentence to establish an additional prerequisite for taking a case to district court, instead of to the Federal Circuit. To fall within the &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) exception, the Government says, it is not enough that a case qualify as a "case of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702]"; in addition, the MSPB's decision must count as a "judicially reviewable action." If the MSPB's decision is not a "judicially reviewable action"--a phrase the Government characterizes as a "term of art in this context,"--the ruling still may be subject to judicial review (i.e., "judicially reviewable" in the ordinary sense), but only in the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Government's second step--that the Board's procedural rulings are not "judicially reviewable actions"--begins with the language of &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3). That provision, the Government states, "defines for the most part which MSPB decisions qualify as 'judicially reviewable actions[s]'" by "providing that '[a]ny decision of the Board under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action as of' the date of the decision." Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3); emphasis and brackets added by Government). From there, the Government moves on to the cross-referenced paragraph--&#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)--which states, among other things, that the Board "shall, within 120 days of [the employee's filing], decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures." According to the Government, the Board only "decide[s]...the issue of discrimination" when it rules on the merits, rather than on procedural grounds. On that view, a procedural decision is not in fact a "decision of the Board under paragraph (1)," which means that it also is not a "judicially reviewable action" under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3). And so (returning now to the first step of the Government's argument), judicial review of a procedural decision can occur only in the Federal Circuit, and not in district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If you need to take a deep breath after all that, you're not alone. It would be hard to dream up a more roundabout way of bifurcating judicial review of the MSPB's rulings in mixed cases. If Congress had wanted to send merits decisions to district court and procedural dismissals to the Federal Circuit, it could just have said so. The Government has offered no reason for Congress to have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And taking the Government's analysis one step at a time makes it no more plausible than as a gestalt. The Government's initial move is to read &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s second sentence as adding a requirement for a case to fall within the exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction. But that sentence does no such thing; it is nothing more than a filing deadline. Consider each sentence of &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) in turn. The first sentence defines which cases should be brought in district court, rather than in the Federal Circuit; here, the full description is "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the <span id="Page_1693"></span>provisions of section 7702"--to wit, mixed cases. The second sentence then states when those cases should be brought: "any such case...must be filed within 30 days" of the date the employee "received notice of the judicially reviewable action." The reference to a "judicially reviewable action" in that sentence does important work: It sets the clock running for when a case that belongs in district court must be filed there. What it does not do is to further define which timely-brought cases belong in district court instead of in the Federal Circuit. Describing those cases is the first sentence's role.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proof positive that the Government misreads &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) comes from considering what the phrase "judicially reviewable action" would mean under its theory. In normal legal parlance, to say that an agency action is not "judicially reviewable" is to say simply that it is not subject to judicial review--that, for one or another reason, it cannot be taken to a court. But that ordinary understanding will not work for the Government here, because it wants to use the phrase to help determine which of two courts should review a decision, rather than whether judicial review is available at all. In the Government's alternate universe, then, to say that an agency action is not "judicially reviewable" is to say that it is subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit (even though not in district court). Small wonder that the Government must call the phrase "judicially reviewable action" a "term of art," <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 9: On a natural reading, the phrase defines cases amenable to judicial review, rather than routes those cases as between two courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And even were we to indulge the Government that far, we could not accept the second step of its analysis. At that stage, remember, the Government contends that under &#x00A7; 7702 only decisions on the merits qualify as "judicially reviewable actions." The language on which the Government principally relies, stated again, is as follows: "[T]he Board shall, within 120 days of [the employee's filing], decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action." But that provision, too, is only a timing requirement; it is designed to ensure that the Board act promptly on employees' complaints. We see no reason to think that embedded within that directive is a limitation on the class of "judicially reviewable actions." Nor (even were we to indulge the Government on that point as well) can we find the particular restriction the Government urges. According to the Government, the MSPB does not "decide...the issue of discrimination" when it dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds. But that phrase cannot bear the weight the Government places on it. All the phrase signifies is that the Board should dispose of the issue in some way, whether by actually adjudicating it or by holding that it was not properly raised. Indeed, were the Government right, &#x00A7; 7702(a)'s statement that the Board "shall" decide the issue of discrimination would appear to bar procedural dismissals, requiring the Board to resolve on the merits even untimely complaints. No one (least of all the Government, which here is defending a procedural ruling) thinks that a plausible congressional command.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another section of the statute--&#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B)--puts the final nail in the coffin bearing the Government's argument. That section states: "[I]f at any time after the 120th day following [an employee's filing] with the Board..., there is no judicially reviewable action[,]...an employee shall be entitled to file a civil action" in district court under a listed antidiscrimination statute. That provision, as the Government notes, is designed "to save employees from being held in perpetual uncertainty by Board inaction." But if, as the Government insists, a procedural ruling is not a "judicially reviewable action," then the provision would have another, surprising effect--essentially blowing up the Government's argument from the inside. In that event, an employee whose suit the Board had dismissed on procedural grounds could bring suit in district court under 7702(e)(1)(B) (so long as 120 days had elapsed from her Board filing), because she would have received "no judicially reviewable action." And what's more, she could do so even many years later, because the statute's usual 30-day filing deadline begins to run only upon "notice of [a] judicially reviewable action." &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). So an argument intended to keep employees like Kloeckner out of district court would paradoxically, and nonsensically, result in giving them all the time in the world to file suit there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Responding to this unwelcome outcome, the Government offers us an exit route: We should avoid "absurd results," the Government urges, by applying &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B) only to "cases over which the Board continues to exert jurisdiction." But as the Government admits, that "gloss on the statute is not found in the text"; the Government's remedy requires our reading new words into the statute. We think a better option lies at hand. If we reject the Government's odd view of "judicially reviewable actions," then no absurdity arises in the first place: &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B) would have no bearing on any case the MSPB dismissed within 120 days, whatever the grounds. It is the Government's own misreading that creates the need to "fix" &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B); take that away and the provision serves, as it was intended, only as a remedy for Board inaction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit. That is so whether the MSPB decided her case on procedural grounds or instead on the merits. Kloeckner therefore brought her suit in the right place. We reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
