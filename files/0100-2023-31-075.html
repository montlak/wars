<h4 class="h4" id="sec22-72"><span class="space">1.</span> Multiple Attorneys</h4>
<p class="noindent">Most EEO cases are not so complicated that two attorneys are required for the hearing. In the absence of specific documentation explaining the need for a second attorney at the hearing, the hours expended by that attorney will not be approved as reasonable. <span class="Italic">Safford v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952348 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">When more than one attorney is involved in a case, there generally is some duplication of hours as each attorney familiarizes himself or herself with the case. A reduction in the number of hours reasonably expended is generally appropriate in such cases. Of course, counsel should attempt to account for the duplication of hours in the fee request as part of standard "billing judgment." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892909 (1989) (finding a 15% reduction proposed by appellant's counsel reasonable to account for duplication of hours due to the involvement of multiple attorneys). However, the agency may not reduce the fees based on an assumption that there was duplicative work where, as part of the verified statement of fees, the attorneys state that they did not bill for time spent updating themselves on the files and in conferences where more than one lawyer was involved only one lawyer actually billed time. <span class="Italic">See Stapp v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A05634 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">"There is no presumption that two attorneys working on one case will result in redundant services being rendered.... Furthermore, courts recognize the propriety of practical necessity of the use of more than one lawyer during litigation." <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090036 (2010) (citations omitted). In upholding the decision of the administrative judge to approve the fee request subject to a 15% reduction, the Commission noted the case was complex, involved over a hundred pleadings and other filings and entailed a three-day hearing on liability and damages. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Katz v. Secretary of State</span>, 0720060024 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carol P. v. Small Business Administration</span>, 2021004687 (2022), for instance, the agency was hard-pressed to defend its position that the case was not complex enough for the complainant to need two attorneys when the agency, itself, was represented by two attorneys:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the case the Agency relies on to support its position that supervisory review of an associate's work is not compensable, <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Department of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 1113700 (Apr. 23, 1992), reveals little support for the Agency's position. While that decision declined a complainant's request to reconsider the Commission's earlier decision on attorney's fees, it noted that the Commission had, in fact, reversed the Agency's decision to disallow over 11 hours of presumably duplicative work for preparing a closing brief and 57.2 hours for pre-trial preparation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, EEO MD-110 cites <span class="Italic">Hodge</span> in opposition to the Agency's position. Indeed, the citation supports Complainant's position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The number of hours should not include excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434; <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998). The presence of multiple counsel at hearing or deposition may be considered duplicative in certain situations, such as where one or more counsel had little or no participation or where the presence of multiple counsel served to delay or prolong the hearing or deposition. <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dep't. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 1992). The presence of multiple counsel is not necessarily duplicative, however, and is often justifiable. Time spent on clearly meritless arguments or motions, and time spent on <span id="Page_2021"></span>unnecessarily uncooperative or contentious conduct may be deducted. <span class="Italic">Luciano v. Olsten Corp</span>., 109 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Clanton v. Allied Chemical Corp</span>., 416 F. Supp. 39 (E.D. Va. 1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEO MD-110, Chapter 11, Section VI(F)(1)(d) (emphases omitted). A review of the record and the hearing transcript demonstrate that both of Complainant's attorneys actively participated in the hearing, with both attorneys taking the lead at different times in questioning witnesses, and the hearing appeared to move along at a solid pace. Accordingly, the admonitions present in <span class="Italic">Hodge</span> simply do not apply here. Moreover, a review of the attorney's fee petition demonstrates that the time expended by Complainant's two attorneys were not duplicative, but rather complementary of each other. A fair reading of the entries reflect that the senior attorney is reviewing and working to develop the junior attorney. Further, a review of the affidavits submitted by each attorney demonstrates that the senior attorney owns his own practice and employs the junior attorney. As such, the senior attorney has an interest in ensuring both that work product bearing the name of his law firm carries the appropriate quality and that the junior attorney is capable of developing such work product.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To this end, the Agency's attempts to defend its decision to send two attorneys to the hearing is not persuasive because it is not exclusive to the Agency. The Agency asserts that its decision to send two attorneys is influenced by a multitude of factors, "which include but are not limited to workload, training opportunities, and experience levels including ability to gain experience." Complainant's attorneys could have easily adopted this argument as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency criticizes the AJ for failing to cite to multiple cases to support his position that "use of more than one attorney does not inherently generate duplicative billing," the Agency ignores that EEO MD-110 contains substantively the same language. The Agency protests that it is not arguing that the attorneys engaged in duplicative costs but rather "duplicate fee billing." We fail to see the distinction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Orlando O. v. Attorney General</span>, 2021003074 (2021), for instance, the Commission rejected the agency's modification of attorney fee award because the "complainant did not provide any affidavits or information regarding the 'additional attorneys and staff members who assisted the trial team with the case'":</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the Agency's objection over Complainant's use of multiple attorneys. On appeal, the Agency argues that a reduction in the attorneys' fees awarded by the AJ is appropriate because the work performed by the attorneys was duplicative and unnecessary given Attorney-1's expertise. Complainant counters by arguing that the use of multiple attorneys is not only allowed in the federal EEO sector, but also necessary given the high-volume nature of his attorney's nonprofit Law Center. Furthermore, Complainant emphasizes that all three of his attorneys of record did not appear at the hearings together, and that either Attorney-2 or Attorney-3, but not both, appeared with Attorney-1 at the hearings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, we agree with Complainant that the Agency has not persuasively shown that the presence of multiple attorneys in this case was duplicative. In this regard, we note that the Commission has long held that [t]he presence of multiple counsel is not necessarily duplicative, however, and is often justifiable." EEOC MD-110 at Chap. 11, VI (4); <span class="Italic">see also Elliott v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080046 (Apr. 15, 2009). There is no presumption that two attorneys working on one case will result in redundant services being rendered. <span class="Italic">Coard v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30222 (Feb. 27, 2004) (finding the work of two attorneys not wasteful where time records revealed the attorneys did not duplicate work). Furthermore, courts recognize the propriety and practical necessity of the use of more than one lawyer during litigation. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720090036 (Dec. 7, 2010), <span class="Italic">citing Bohen v. East Chicago</span>, 666 F. Supp. 154, 157 (N.D. Ind. 1987) (finding that in an employment litigation case, the use of more than one lawyer is common in legal practice). We further note that the Commission weighs a variety of factors as to whether there is justification for using more than one attorney on the same case, such as the volume of pleadings filed in the case, the complexity involved in the case, the length of the hearing, and novel legal issues raised in the litigation. <span class="Italic">Katz v. Dep't of State</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0720060024, 0720060025 (Mar. 26, 2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though the Agency did not supplement the record on appeal with an affidavit from Attorney-2, presumably due to Attorney-2's resignation from the nonprofit Law Center, we note that the Agency had the opportunity during the damages hearing to question Attorney-1 and Attorney-3 about Attorney-2's skills and qualifications but did not do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant's legal team represented Complainant for approximately six years. Given this extended timespan, we do not find the presence of multiple counsel and support staff over the years to be too excessive, duplicative, and/or redundant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are also unpersuaded by the Agency's contention that Complainant's fee petition lacks sufficient specificity to be reimbursable. As discussed above, the Agency found that Attorney-1's fees were reimbursable because "the fee petition and supporting evidence sufficiently support[ed] awarding [Attorney-1]'s fees." Although the Agency raises concerns regarding the lack of specificity in the billing entries from Attorney-2 and Attorney-3, we note that their billing entries are located on the same table as Attorney-1 in adjacent columns. Given that the billing entries for Attorney-2 and Attorney-3 provide the same level of detail as the billing entries for Attorney-1, we find the Agency's expressed concerns regarding the lack of specificity to be unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent">As for the cited examples of duplicative billing noted in the Agency's final order, we are disinclined to find the claimed hours to be duplicative. In this regard, while we acknowledge that some of the claimed hours include reviewing carbon copied emails or participating in group conference calls, we find these hours to be reasonable, as both Attorney-2 and Attorney-3 engaged in these activities to ensure that they were aware of the latest details about the case. Moreover, we agree with Complainant that the Agency's "decision not to call on Attorney-3 does not eliminate the hours that [Attorney-3] spent in the hearing and assisting [Attorney-1] while [Attorney-1] questioned witnesses." For these reasons, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the AJ's assessment of $74,225.00 in attorneys' fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not unreasonable for a senior trial attorney to use a lesser paid associate to assist with trial preparation, such as interviewing witnesses and summarizing their statements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01911370 (1991). But, hours spent by the associate at the hearing are properly deductible. The senior attorney, who was experienced in EEO law, did not need the assistance of an associate at the hearing. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01974148 (1998), the Commission denied hours claimed by an associate for case review and observation where the case was being handled by a senior partner experienced in EEO law. In <span class="Italic">Nolan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40119 (2006), the Commission disallowed the hours by a second attorney spent at deposition and hearing where the attorney played no active role in either. The Commission found "nothing unusually difficult or complex about this case; therefore, when considering Attorney--2's lack of participation, it is not readily apparent why two attorneys were need at these proceedings." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Layman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995568 (2002), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 05A20810 (2002), the Commission did approve fees for the attendance of two attorneys at a two-day hearing involving a sexual harassment claim. The Commission found that three attorneys for the complainant were not necessary and disallowed fees for the third attorney. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Layman</span> rejected the agency's argument that the case was not complicated, noting that "[p]roof of sexual harassment involves matters of subjective perception that are frequently difficult to prove. The same is true of claims of nonpecuniary compensatory damages." Interestingly, the Commission, while rejecting the complainant's argument that she needed three attorneys, also noted that the agency had sent three representatives to the first day of the hearing. The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Page-Sanchez v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720050080 (2007), again noting the complexity of sexual harassment cases and compensatory damage claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">When more than one attorney is involved in a case it is not unreasonable for the attorneys to confer. However, that does not mean it is reasonable for both attorneys to bill for that conference time. Generally speaking, only one attorney will be permitted to bill for conference time absent a situation where the case is complex enough to warrant co-counsel. Usually, it will be the senior attorney who will bill for conference time. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01976454 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that it was reasonable for the agency to disallow the charges of one attorney where both attorneys were charging for the time spent conferring with each other, and for when both attorneys attended the prehearing and settlement conferences, and only to award the senior attorney's time<span class="Italic">. Hodge v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920057 (April 23, 1992). We also find that in some instances the agency improperly disallowed the charges that should have been awarded for the attorneys conferring with each other, and for the time the associate took to review the case file when first working on the case. For instance, on July 30, 1996, the senior attorney charged $90.00 for .40 hours and the associate did not charge any amount for the time the two spent conferring about the case, but the agency did not award any sum.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Oest v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110002 (2011) (approving 0.4 hours for experienced attorney to consult with another attorney on the case, particularly where counsel had already eliminated several hours from the fee petition).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing inherently improper in using multiple counsel and paralegals in a case, but that does not mean that all time billed constitutes reasonable hours expended. In <span class="Italic">O'Malley v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080013 (2009), the Commission found an award of more than $71,000 in fees to be "more than adequate in a case that is relatively straightforward, and that did not proceed to trial except for on the issue of damages." The Commission rejected the complainant's request for an additional $65,000 in fees to cover the work of multiple attorneys and paralegals who worked on the case noting the finding of the administrative judge that the case was not legally or factually complex <span id="Page_2022"></span>and was actually made more complex by the number of motions filed by complainant's counsel, the majority of which were denied, and the number of untimely attempts to amend the complaint and raise claims that no legal validity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120083765 (2012), the Commission disallowed fees for a second attorney finding the services were duplicative and unnecessary noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that both A1 and A2, among other things, billed for reviewing case file materials, reviewing discovery, travel time, telephoning Complainant, interviewing witnesses, and for hearing attendance and preparation. In particular, we note that on January 1, 2005, both A1 and A2 billed for hearing attendance and preparation totaling 16.5 hours. Also both billed for travel time from Washington, D.C. to Atlanta for hearing attendance and preparation. We also note that on August 3, 2004, and August 11, 2004, A2 billed for conference calls with A1. There has been no showing that this case was unusually complex or difficult as to require the presence of two expert attorneys. It is undisputed that A1 has more than 20 years of EEO legal experience, while A2 only had eight years of experience. We agree with the Agency that a second attorney's presence, in a case where an attorney with A1's level of experience is involved, merely duplicates services and should be disallowed. <span class="Italic">See Bynum v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33384 (May 26, 2004) (finding that the complainant did not establish that her second attorney was required for the hearing); <span class="Italic">see also Hodge v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the case spanned some four years, involved two different administrative judges and involved several claims, <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130035 (2015), provides a good example of some of the situations where the Commission will and will not allow as reasonable time spent by multiple attorneys on a case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will first address the hours claimed by Complainant's attorneys. AJ2 found that the issue was not factually or legally complicated and, as a result, the number of hours claimed was not reasonable. AJ2 found that this was a "garden variety discrimination case" and focused on the fact that Complainant only had to establish that he was subjected to discrimination "for about six to seven months." AJ2 noted that the greatest number of hours claimed was 341.5 hours by a specific attorney, which, AJ2 stated, "In my experience, the 341.5 hours claimed...is excessive for the litigation of this straightforward individual discrimination case, even if [this attorney's] services constituted the total attorney hours claimed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ2 found that Complainant's counsel improperly "bundled" multiple activities into single time entries. For example, attorneys claimed 4.8 hours on May 29, 2009, for "Legal services: draft/revise Client's discovery responses; Review client documents to provide to Agency; Forward discovery responses to BW for review." AJ2 stated that, instead, each activity should have been listed separately. AJ2 also found that there was excessive and overlapping time billed. AJ2 found that there were numerous examples of two attorneys doing much of the same work on the same days. The AJ awarded none of the hours of the senior attorneys who worked on the case concluding that "it was not reasonable to have more than one moderately experienced attorney working on the case at any one time."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ2 ultimately reduced the attorneys' total hours by 75 percent and awarded Complainant $95,186.78 for attorneys' fees and paralegal fees. With regard to the hourly rate, the AJ found that, while it was reasonable for Complainant to seek counsel outside of Reno, Nevada, he should have sought counsel in Sacramento or San Francisco instead of a firm in Washington. D.C., because it would have cut down on travel time and costs. Additionally, because one of the attorneys and one law clerk who did a large portion of the work were located in Denver, Colorado, the AJ found that the attorney compensation rate for all attorneys should be $250 per hour instead of the $290 per hour rate for D.C., and that the law clerk rate for all law clerks should be $125 per hour instead of the $145 per hour rate for D.C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that AJ2 abused his discretion by reducing the attorneys' hours by 75 percent. Specifically, we find that AJ2 erred when he found that Complainant's attorneys were unreasonable when they spent so much time on various discovery activities such as the filing of multiple motions to compel and for sanctions. We note that AJ1 believed these motions had merit, as she granted Complainant's motion for sanctions against the Agency for its actions during the discovery phase, which AJ2 ultimately overruled in his damages decision. As a result, we do not find that the time spent on these activities can be considered unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we do not find it unreasonable that a large number of attorneys, law clerks, and other support staff worked on preparing this case for litigation and for the damages hearing, as the record establishes that, throughout the four year litigation, staff at the firm changed and some of the attorneys who worked on the case were replaced by other attorneys, leading to an overall large number of attorneys who each worked on the case at some point in time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that this was not as easy case, as AJ2 determined. The record establishes that this case was made complex by the allegations of harassment involving reprisal, and that it was made more complex by the many motions filed by both parties, and the thousands of often unorganized documents gathered during discovery. We also find that AJ2 erred when he heavily relied on his finding that this was an "easy case" because the liability period was "only six to seven months," which we have found above was not correct; the liability period was instead almost four years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ2 did not take into consideration the fact that there were a large number of hours in this case because, in part, Complainant's counsel had to essentially prepare for the liability hearing twice. Specifically, AJ1 canceled the liability hearing two weeks before the hearing was set to take place, and it was not rescheduled until four months later, requiring Complainant's counsel to have to prepare for the hearing twice. Additionally, because the case was bifurcated into a liability phase and a damages phase, Complainant's counsel had to prepare for both the liability hearing and the damages hearing. It is reasonable that three preparations for hearings would result in a large number of hours expended by counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that AJ2 erred when he found that time spent on drafting briefs such as opening statements at both hearings was unreasonable because opening statements were not required by either AJ. We note that the opening statements were referenced in the AJ's decisions and we reviewed them on appeal; these statements were useful and served a purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ2 found that it was unreasonable that Complainant had two attorneys at the deposition and two attorneys at the hearing. The Commission has held generally that where two attorneys perform the same service, such services will be considered duplicative, and only one attorney will be entitled to compensation, unless a showing is made that the case was unusually difficult or complex. <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 1992). In <span class="Italic">Hodge</span>, the Commission found that an Associate Attorney's presence at a hearing along with a Senior Attorney was not needed, and thus was not reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission has followed this precedent and has not allowed attorney fee's where a second attorney's presence at a hearing is not shown to be reasonable. <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Dep't of Health and Human Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120083765 (June 12, 2012); <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33384 (May 26, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that it was reasonable for Complainant to have two attorneys present at the depositions because both attorneys were very involved in preparing for the discovery and litigation and both focused their time and attention on different witnesses. Therefore, it was reasonable that both attorneys were needed in order to conduct thorough depositions of the witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we agree with AJ2 that it was not reasonable for the senior-level partner to collect fees for his participation in the liability and damages hearings. The record establishes that two attorneys represented Complainant at the hearing; a mid-level experienced attorney who had worked on the case from almost the beginning, and a senior-level partner from the firm who performed very minimal work on the case prior to the hearing. In the Complainant's appellate brief, Complainant stated that the senior-level partner was "only consulted when his expertise was absolutely necessary" prior to the hearing. We note that of the senior-level partner's total 86.9 billed hours, 68.2 of those hours were spent traveling to the liability and damages hearings and for his presence at the hearings. In contrast, the mid-level attorney at the hearing had worked on the litigation for years and was very familiar with the facts of the case and the witnesses, and reasonably could have conducted the hearing without the assistance of the senior-level partner. Therefore, in following our precedent, we will reduce the senior-level partner's reasonable hours by 68.2 hours, which is the time attributed to the hearings, resulting in reimbursable hours of 18.7 hours for the minimal amount of work he otherwise performed for this case. We note that a law clerk was also present at the hearing, and this law clerk also assisted in preparation of the litigation. Therefore, fee reimbursement for the law clerk is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with AJ2 that there are instances of duplication of time billed by numerous attorneys, law clerks, and paralegals for the same work throughout the time of the litigation. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Hodge v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 1992) (Commission found that supervisory review of associate's services by partner in law firm is duplicative and not compensable). Additionally, Complainant should not receive attorneys' fees for time spent on work related to his unsuccessful national origin claim. Similarly, Complainant should not receive compensation for work performed on his constructive discharge claim or for requests for damages related to this claim, such <span id="Page_2023"></span>as damages for his job search and relocation expenses, back pay, front pay, reinstatement, lost economic opportunity, unforeseen tax consequences, and his spouse's lost economic opportunity. We find that, while some of the time spent on this work is distinct, in some instances the hours spent on this work is intertwined with work the attorneys, law clerks, and paralegals conducted that is compensable. As a result, we find that a 20 percent reduction of the total hours each individual worked is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Moresi v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090049 (March 29, 2010) (across-the-board 20 percent reduction in attorney's fees reasonable); <span class="Italic">Hyde v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073964 (Nov. 24, 2009) (a 10 percent across-the-board reduction appropriate when number of billing entries not sufficiently detailed); <span class="Italic">Blinick v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20079 (Feb. 3, 2004) (20 percent reduction of attorney's fees appropriate when complainant only successful on part of her complaint).</p>
