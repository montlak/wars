<h2 class="h2" id="sec17-45"><span class="space">IV.</span> PROOF IN REPRISAL CASES</h2>
<p class="noindent">As with intentional discrimination cases, there is often no direct evidence of reprisal. However, direct evidence cases do occur with some frequency most likely because supervisors and managers are less aware that their actions may be retaliatory. Circumstantial evidence is analyzed in line with <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>. Although the analytical mode itself is largely the same, the focus is less on how the employee was treated, as compared with similarly situated employees. Comparison evidence can be relevant to the issue of pretext and, in some cases, may even be dispositive, but the Commission also looks at other factors.</p>
<p class="noindent">In EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 8, the Commission included a charge-processing outline that is helpful in terms of understanding the analytical mode for retaliation cases. Although that guidance has now been superseded by EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 (2016), the analytical mode remains the same:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In processing a charge involving an allegation of retaliation, consider the following issues (for a detailed discussion of each issue, see accompanying chapter at referenced pages):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are three essential elements of a retaliation claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1)&#x2003;protected activity--opposition to discrimination or participation in the statutory complaint process</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2)&#x2003;adverse action</p>
<p class="noindent-3">3)&#x2003;causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">I.&#x2003;Protected Activity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;Did CP [complaining party] oppose discrimination?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2003;Did the charging party (CP) explicitly or implicitly communicate to the respondent (R) or another covered entity a belief that its activity constituted unlawful discrimination under Title VII, the ADA, the ADEA, or the EPA?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--If the protest was broad or ambiguous, would CP's protest reasonably have been interpreted as opposition to such unlawful discrimination?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Did someone closely associated with CP oppose discrimination?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;Was the manner of opposition reasonable? Was the manner of opposition so disruptive that it significantly interfered with R's legitimate business concerns?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--If the manner of opposition was not reasonable, CP is not protected under the anti-retaliation clauses.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">3.&#x2003;Did CP have a reasonable and good faith belief that the opposed practice violated the anti-discrimination laws?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--If so, CP is protected against retaliation, even if s/he was mistaken about the unlawfulness of the challenged practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--If not, CP is not protected under the anti-retaliation clauses.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;Did CP participate in the statutory complaint process?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did CP or someone closely associated with CP file a charge, or testify, assist, or participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or lawsuit under the statutes enforced by the EEOC?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--If so, CP is protected against retaliation regardless of the validity or reasonableness of the original allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--CP is protected against retaliation by a respondent for participating in statutory complaint proceedings even if that complaint involved a different covered entity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">II.&#x2003;Adverse Action</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did R subject CP to any kind of adverse treatment?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Adverse actions undertaken after CP's employment relationship with R ended, such as negative job references, can be challenged.</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--Although trivial annoyances are not actionable, more <span id="Page_1493"></span>significant retaliatory treatment that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity is unlawful. There is no requirement that the adverse action materially affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">III.&#x2003;Causal Connection</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;Is there direct evidence that retaliation was a motive for the adverse action?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2003;Did R official admit that it undertook the adverse action because of the protected activity?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;Did R official express bias against CP based on the protected activity? If so, is there evidence linking that statement of bias to the adverse action?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--Such a link would be established if, for example, the statement was made by the decision-maker at the time of the challenged action.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">If there is direct evidence that retaliation was a motive for the adverse action, "cause" should be found. Evidence as to any additional legitimate motive would be relevant only to relief, under a mixed-motives analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;Is there circumstantial evidence that retaliation was the true reason for the adverse action?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2003;Is there evidence raising an inference that retaliation was the cause of the adverse action?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--Such an inference is raised if the adverse action took place shortly after the protected activity and if the decision-maker was aware of the protected activity before undertaking the adverse action.</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--If there was a long period of time between the protected activity and the adverse action, determine whether there is other evidence raising an inference that the cause of the adverse action was retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;Has R produced evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">3.&#x2003;Is R's explanation a pretext designed to hide retaliation?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--Did R treat similarly situated employees who did not engage in protected activity differently from CP?</p>
<p class="noindent-4">--Did R subject CP to heightened scrutiny after s/he engaged in protected activity?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If, on the basis of all of the evidence, the investigator is persuaded that retaliation was the true reason for the adverse action, then "cause" should be found.</p>
<p class="noindent">Protected activity is discussed more fully earlier under the heading, "<a href="0100-2023-26-035.html#sec17-36">Protected Activity--Opposition Clause.</a>" The "<a href="0100-2023-26-048.html#sec17-49">Adverse Treatment Requirement</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-26-073.html#sec17-72">Causal Connection</a>" are discussed later under those headings.</p>
<p class="noindent">A good example of the proper analysis of circumstantial evidence in a reprisal case comes from <span class="Italic">Coffee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120117 (2013), where the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment to the agency and issued a summary judgment decision in favor of the complainant. The case draws an important distinction in the analysis between intentional discrimination and retaliation cases. In <span class="Italic">Coffee</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that she was subjected to reprisal for her prior protected EEO activity when her performance rating was downgraded. Complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960403 (Dec. 6, 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802). Specifically, in a reprisal claim, and in accordance with the burdens set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Coffman v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960473 (Nov. 20, 1997), Complainant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal by showing that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the Agency was aware of the protected activity; (3) subsequently, she was subjected to adverse treatment by the Agency; and (4) a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. <span class="Italic">Whitmire v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00340 (Sept. 25, 2000). A nexus may be shown by evidence that the adverse treatment followed the protected activity within such a period of time and in such a manner that a reprisal motive is inferred. <span class="Italic">See Clay v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A35231 (Jan. 25, 2005). Once Complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden then shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). Once the Agency has met its burden, the Complainant bears the ultimate responsibility to persuade the fact finder by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency acted on the basis of a prohibited reason. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has stated that adverse actions need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation. EEOC Compliance Manual Section 8: Retaliation, No. 915.003, at 8-15 (May 20, 1998); <span class="Italic">see Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. 53 (2006) (finding that the anti-retaliation provision protects individuals from a retaliatory action that a reasonable person would have found "materially adverse," which in the retaliation context means that the action might have deterred a reasonable person from opposing discrimination or participating in the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant established that she engaged in protected activity and that all management officials involved in this complaint were aware of the protected activity. Complainant also established that she was subjected to adverse treatment when the Chief of Staff ordered the supervisor to lower Complainant's performance evaluation to a 3. We note that the AJ erred in her analysis when she found that Complainant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because she failed to establish that she was treated differently than similarly situated individuals outside of her protected class. This is not the proper <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case analysis for a claim of reprisal discrimination, where we instead analyze how an individual person was adversely treated rather than solely comparing heir to similarly situated individuals, and whether or not that individual's adverse treatment was based on their prior protected EEO activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the evidence in the record is sufficient to establish that there was a nexus between the protected EEO activity and the lower performance rating. Complainant's compensatory damages claim was on appeal with the Commission until March 2009, and her appeal for attorney's fees was active with the Commission until November 2009. This latter appeal was still pending at the time the Chief of Staff ordered that Complainant's appraisal be lowered. Additionally, temporal proximity is not the only way one may establish that a nexus existed. <span class="Italic">Walton v. National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072925 (July 11, 2012) (Despite a three year difference between the protected activity and the adverse action, there was evidence in the record that established that the supervisor was motivated by reprisal towards Complainant's previous protected EEO activity). Complainant's supervisor's testified that she believes the Chief of Staff ordered the rating to be changed because of Complainant's previous EEO activity. Additionally, the supervisor's testimony described an ongoing bias from upper management against Complainant ever since she engaged in the previous EEO activity. For example, Complainant's supervisor stated that when she first allowed Complainant to transfer to her office, Complainant's first EEO complaint was active at the time and brought with her "a lot of baggage." The Commander was angry that the supervisor allowed the transfer and allegedly said to the supervisor "you didn't do what I think you did," "I can't believe you did that," and "if you hadn't [accepted her transfer, the Agency] would have settled for [less]." Complainant's supervisor also stated that because of her previous EEO activity, upper level management will always view Complainant as a villain and a mediocre employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once Complainant establishes her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination, the Agency must articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. The Chief of Staff stated that he returned Complainant's appraisal to the supervisor because it was poorly written, the score was not justified by the writing, and it was high for Complainant's few years of service and her position as a trainee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the final step in the analysis, the inquiry moves to consideration of whether Complainant carried her burden to demonstrate pretext. In order to prevail on her claim of discrimination, Complainant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's articulated reason was a pretext for discrimination. Complainant can do this by showing that the Agency's explanation is unworthy of credence and that its actions were influenced by legally impermissible criteria, i.e., <span class="Italic">animus</span> toward her because of her prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that an Agency has broad discretion to carry out personnel decisions, such as performance evaluations, and should not be second-guessed by the reviewing authority absent evidence of unlawful motivation. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 259; <span class="Italic">Stiles v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Request No. 05910577 (June 27, 1991). Here, we find that there is evidence in the record that there was unlawful motivation in the Agency's decision to lower Complainant's rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserted that she deserved a Level 4 performance rating because she was the person everyone came to for help and advice, she corrected her coworkers' errors, and she was the only person in her organization that had 14 extra duties. Additionally, the Chief of Staff returned to Complainant's supervisor five appraisals for employees under her supervision, and three out of the five employees had prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's assertions are supported by the statements of her supervisor. Complainant's supervisor stated that Complainant deserved a Level 4 rating, and that the Chief of Staff's articulation that trainees such as Complainant cannot get such a high rating is false, as many trainees achieve a Level 4 rating. The supervisor also stated that the Chief of Staff <span id="Page_1494"></span>told her that he did not disagree with the narrative of Complainant's performance; he just didn't like the score. This is a contradiction of the Chief of Staff's assertion that the evaluation's narrative was poorly written.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's supervisor stated that she was the only person who observed Complainant's performance on a daily basis, she was the best judge of Complainant's performance, and that the Chief of Staff had no knowledge about Complainant's performance because they never discussed Complainant's performance. Complainant's supervisor stated that Complainant outperformed her other staff, she was training other staff members, she learned faster than other staff, she took more initiative than other staff, and she was "running rings" around the Specialists. Complainant's supervisor stated, "In my judgment, she was well above what was required of a GS-7 tech. She was doing stuff that I would have expected my GS-12 to do." Again, the supervisor stated that she believed the Chief of Staff ordered the rating to be lowered because of Complainant's previous EEO activity, and that there was an overall retaliatory animus towards Complainant from upper management because of her previous successful EEO complaint.</p>
