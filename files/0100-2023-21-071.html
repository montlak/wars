<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-64"><span class="space">2.</span> Commission Cases</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the past, the Commission has vacillated on whether advances directed at a member of the same sex are covered by Title VII. The Commission originally held that Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, but that this does not include sexual orientation. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01831816 (1983). Although the Commission had held that sexual orientation does not receive protection under Title VII, it had also held that sexual harassment was prohibited, regardless of the sexual orientation of the RMO. <span class="Italic">McClain v. International Trade Commission</span>, 01852958 (1987). This is consistent with the Commission's interpretation of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment on a heterosexual basis, as discussed above. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Blackburn v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01966350 (1997) (holding that an allegation by a male complainant that his male supervisor subjected him to unwanted advances stated a claim). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10056 (2002) (employment discrimination motivated by a false perception of complainant's sexual orientation was not actionable).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in the wake of <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, the Commission still seemed muddled about how to deal with complaints of same-sex harassment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sexton v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05970111 (1999), the Commission found that its previous decision in the case was in error when it found the complainant alleged discrimination because of his sexual orientation instead of his sex. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Sexton</span> alleged a series of events in which coworkers made vulgar comments about him, and displayed pictures of male genitalia. The Commission's decision does not specifically describe the comments, except to note that only one referred to the complainant as a "homo." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Karlovich v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01974930 (1999) (a complaint by a male employee that he was sexually harassed by a male medical officer stated a claim). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A31163 (2003) (holding that comments such as referring to the complainant as "gay boy, faggot, and queer" constituted an allegation of harassment based on sexual orientation and did not state a claim under Title VII); <span class="Italic">Grumbling v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21936 (2003) (no claim lies where comments are based on sexual orientation); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01A30885 (2003) (same). For instance, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120123000 (2013), the complainant alleged, among other things, that one coworker told another coworker that the complainant was "a lesbian" and "lazy" and not to help her. The complainant alleged discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, to the extent that Complainant may be appealing the dismissal of her claim of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, we find that such a claim is not within the EEOC's purview. <span class="Italic">See Castello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520110649 (December 20, 2011). The Commission has held that Title VII does prohibit sex stereotyping discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted). In the present case, however, we note that there is no indication in the record and Complainant has not claimed that she was subjected to any sex stereotyping discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission then went on to say:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_863"></span>In her formal complaint, Complainant identified the alleged incident of discrimination as: on January 9, 2012, Complainant's coworker (Coworker 1) advised her that another coworker (Coworker 2) made the statement, "[Complainant] is a lesbian, she is lazy, she will use you, do not help her" to Coworker 1. However, in her formal complaint she stated that she wanted "this incident and related incidents to be investigated."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find Complainant is alleging that because of her sex, Coworker 2 and others unreasonably interfered with her ability to do her work and created a hostile work environment on the basis of her sex. Complainant states that as a result of the Agency's actions, her own team denied her support at work. She states that as a result of having been denied support, she worked extremely long hours, including weekends, during paid leave, and even holidays, just to meet her deadlines. Thus, we find Complainant's complaint is properly defined as including the comment that Coworker 2 made to Coworker 1 that "[Complainant] is a lesbian, she is lazy, she will use you, do not help her" and the additional like or related incidents identified on appeal. In the present case, we find considering these incidents together and assuming them to have occurred as alleged by Complainant, she has stated a viable claim of discriminatory harassment based on sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result of cases like <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, it remained unclear what distinction the Commission was trying to draw between discrimination based on sexual orientation and discrimination based on sex given that, by definition, gays and lesbians do not conform to the traditional gender stereotypes which is why, invariably, there are claiming discrimination. This is particularly true given the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Macy v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt?utm_source=News+and+Case+Alert!+4-4+(Dewey+Publications+Inc.+-+deweypub.com)&utm_campaign=NaCA+Email+04-03&utm_medium=email">0120120821</a> (2012), discussed in <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, holding that transgender status is protected under Title VII and the analysis in those cases is not restricted to gender stereotyping but extends to all types of discrimination under Title VII, such as disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction was further muddled by Commission decisions that appear to evaluate cases of alleged sex-harassment without reference to whether the conduct is sex-based. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132902 (2014), the Commission reversed dismissal of a case where the complainant, a male, alleged that a male coworker attempted to grab his butt, patted him on the butt on a few occasions and called him names on a daily basis, though the complaint failed to specify any names. The Commission found the alleged incidents, taken as a whole, were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment without any analysis of the basis for the alleged conduct. It reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120131065 (2014), where the complainant, a female, alleged that a female coworker lifted up her skits and grabbed her buttocks and said "You thought it was the security guard, didn't you?" Again, the Commission found the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to allege a hostile environment but gave no explanation of how it was sex-based.</p>
<p class="noindent">To this mix is added <span class="Italic">Cano v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A40081 (2006), in which the Commission, finding the complainant was subject to harassment suggesting he was homosexual and, therefore, the harassment was based on his sex and not his sexual orientation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cano</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we will address the agency's claim that the AJ abused his discretion by considering all instances of sexual harassment raised in testimony at the hearing, evident in the investigative file and described in complainant's second EEO complaint, Agency Case No. 03-2507.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in his first EEO complaint dated September 1, 2002, under Agency Case No. 02-2395, complainant sought and received counseling on, among other issues, "overall harassment" and identified sex as one of the bases in that complaint. We also note that in a January 28, 2003 affidavit in support of that complaint, complainant discussed allegations of sexual harassment including a comment by Chief 2 in December 2002, that complainant was "queer"; reference to an April 2001 joke about complainant being gay; an incident of a picture of a flower taped to complainant's back in April 2001; profane graffiti appearing in the men's bathroom in February 2002; a posting on a break room bulletin board depicting a gay bar as "Cano's Place"; and an electronic mail message that was sent out to complainant and carbon copied to Chief 3 and co-worker A referring to an enforcement operation named "Operation Viagra." Further, we note that the investigative file contained copies of the "Flower Girl" posting; a July 25, 2002 electronic mail message from the Port Director noting that cartoons and caricatures of agency personnel is unauthorized and should be removed; a July 2002 bulletin board posting depicting a gay bar as "Cano's Place"; and the January 8, 2002 electronic mail message referring to "Operation Viagra."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the investigative file contains a January 30, 2003 affidavit from Chief 2 who was questioned regarding the circulation of a gay joke in April 2001; the profane graffiti posted in February 2002; the map depicting a gay bar as "Cano's Place"; and the "Operation Viagra" electronic mail message. We note the record also contains affidavits from co-worker A and Employee X, a subordinate of complainant's, who were also questioned regarding complainant's claims about gay jokes in the office and profane graffiti.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the record contains a copy of complainant's Objections and Answers to the Agency's First Set of Interrogatories, Requests for Production and Requests for Admissions dated October 16, 2003, in connection with Agency Case No. 02-2395. We note that in Interrogatory numbers (3) and (12), complainant states that in addition to the accepted issues in this case, he is asserting a claim for a hostile work environment and states "although I am not homosexual, my supervisors and co-workers made inappropriate comments, gestures, and have subjected me to a hostile work place by continuing to allow supervisory personnel and co-workers to comment to each other and outside personnel that I am a homosexual."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as described above, on May 21, 2003, complainant filed a second EEO complaint, Agency Case No. 03-2507, alleging continuing sexual harassment when Chief 1 made the comment "Poor Cano thought he had gotten him a man." We find that the AJ properly consolidated the "Poor Cano" comment identified as an incidence of sexual harassment in retaliation for protected EEO activity with the pending complaint under Agency Case No. 02-2395.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we note complainant did not explicitly raise a claim of same sex sexual harassment in his first EEO complaint, we find that the agency was aware that complainant alleged that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on his sex prior to the filing and consolidation of the second complaint. Further, we note that at the hearing, the agency was afforded the opportunity to question complainant regarding the incidents of sexual harassment he raised in the investigative report and at the hearing. Additionally, we note that at the hearing the agency asked Employee X, the Port Director and Chief 1 about, among other things: complainant's allegations of sexual harassment, including the "Flower Girl" picture taped to complainant's back; the bulletin board posting depicting a gay bar as "Cano's Place"; the graffiti posted in the men's bathroom; the delivery by the Port Director of a pink envelope to complainant stating "I hear you like the big ones"; the Port Director's July 25, 2002 electronic mail message regarding the posting of cartoons and caricatures; the "Poor Cano" comment; and the circumstances surrounding complainant's three complaints to Chief 1 regarding harassment in the work place. Upon review, we find that the agency was given the opportunity to fully litigate complainant's sexual harassment claim. Thus, we reject the agency's arguments that the AJ abused his discretion in adding and rendering a decision on complainant's claim of continuing sexual harassment. Now, the Commission shall review the AJ's finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a claim of harassment based on sex, complainant must show that: (1) he is a member of the statutorily protected class; (2) he was subjected to harassment in the form of unwelcome verbal or physical conduct involving the protected class; (3) the harassment complained of was based on the statutorily protected class; and (4) the harassment affected a term or condition of employment and/or had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the work environment and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. <span class="Italic">Humphrey v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965238 (October 16, 1998); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11. The harasser's conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994). Further, the incidents must have been "sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</span> 23 U.S. 75 (1998). In the case of harassment by a supervisor, complainant must also show that there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer. <span class="Italic">See Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, complainant is a member of a statutorily protected class, in that he is male. Additionally, the record supports the AJ's finding that complainant was subjected to unwelcome comments, rumors and graffiti in the workplace beginning in April 2001, and continuing through March 2003. We note that the record reveals that among other instances, in April 2001, complainant was told by co-worker A that he "fight[s] like a girl"; a "Flower Girl" drawing was taped to complainant's back in April 2001; in November 2001, co-worker A said in front of a group of inspectors over a speaker phone that complainant was "queer"; beginning in January 2002, complainant was the subject of graffiti in the men's bathroom, which included statements, such as "Cano swallows," "Cano sucks dicks," "Cano's a queer," "Cano takes it up the ass"; in July 2002, the bulletin board in the break room contained a posting depicting a gay bar as "Cano's Place"; on January 9, 2003, an electronic mail message that was sent out to complainant by Chief 1 and carbon copied to Chief 3 and co-worker A referring to an enforcement operation named "Operation Viagra"; agency inspectors made gestures that they were inserting KY Jelly up their behinds and directed it at complainant; agency inspectors used their palm pilots to view sexual positions and directed it at complainant; and in March 2003, an inspector commented "Hey, ask Cano what's good <span id="Page_864"></span>for a rash on his ass, you know, and let me know, because it looks like he's tapped up today." The record reveals that the sexually explicit remarks, graffiti, and postings were based on complainant's sex. The record does not indicate that the sexually explicit remarks, graffiti, and postings were based on complainant's sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the presence of the previously described sexually explicit comments and graffiti directed at complainant, after he expressed that he found them offensive, were sufficiently severe and pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment. The Commission notes that, evaluated from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in complainant's circumstances, the sexually explicit comments and graffiti were extremely offensive and we note the record shows that complainant, a veteran supervisor with the agency, had his authority undermined by the offensive conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">It was by no means clear, but based on the Commission's findings in <span class="Italic">McLean, supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Warth, supra</span>, there was some indication that the Commission was trying to draw a distinction based on whether the alleged harassment involved conduct or comments that were suggestive of homosexual advances, or involved conduct or comments meant to demean a complainant because of his or her sexual orientation, or perceived sexual orientation. Both <span class="Italic">McLean</span> and <span class="Italic">Warth</span> involved a supervisor making homosexual demands on a subordinate. The conclusion was that, but for the subordinate's sex, as opposed to his sexual orientation, he would not have been subjected to those advances. On the other hand, it can be argued that when an employee is subjected to hostile environment harassment because of his or her sexual orientation, or perceived sexual orientation, the conduct is not similarly sex-based--a position the Commission has now adopted based on its decisions in <span class="Italic">Veretto</span>, <span class="Italic">Castello</span> and <span class="Italic">Macy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120112716 (2013), the Commission in finding that the complainant had not established that the reasons for providing a negative employment reference were a pretext for discrimination stated "while Title VII's prohibition of discrimination does not explicitly include sexual orientation as a basis, Title VII does prohibit sex stereotyping discrimination." The decision noted that the complainant did not allege stereotyping as part of his complaint of sexual orientation discrimination. The statement, made in dicta in the decision, is most likely not intended as a definitive statement of the Commission's position on sexual orientation discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Culp v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130012 (2013), a supervisory transportation security officer alleged that her demotion and a reprimand were based on her sexual orientation. The complainant alleged that after she was promoted to the supervisory position she was told not to take breaks and have lunch with another security officer who was openly lesbian because it created an "improper perception." In finding that the administrative judge did not err in denying the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Culp</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over this complaint because the Commission does not enforce the protections that prohibit discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation. To support its claim, the Agency asserts that Complainant characterized her allegations as a sexual orientation claim and she did not use the words "sex discrimination" when making her allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the Commission has previously found that as long as the allegations state a viable claim of sex discrimination, the fact that a Complainant has characterized the basis of discrimination as sexual orientation does not defeat an otherwise valid sex discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110008 (Jan. 11, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII does not explicitly include sexual orientation as a basis for protection under the law. Nevertheless, the law's broad prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of...sex" will offer coverage to gay individuals in certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">Baker, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Supreme Court has recognized, Title VII's prohibition on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of "gender." <span class="Italic">Macy v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt">0120120821</a> (April 20, 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989)). This includes discrimination because an individual fails to conform to gender-based expectations, stereotypical or otherwise. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although we are not bound by federal circuit court precedent in Title VII for purposes of our adjudication of federal sector complaints, we note that, since Price Waterhouse, every court of appeals has recognized that disparate treatment for failing to conform to gender-based expectations is sex discrimination and has also concluded that this principle applies with equal force in cases involving plaintiffs who are gay, bisexual, heterosexual, or transgender. <span class="Italic">See Prowel v. Wise Business Forms, Inc</span>., 579 F.3d 285, 290 (3d Cir. 2009) (harassment of a gay man targeting his gender-nonconforming behavior and appearance is sex harassment); <span class="Italic">Miller v. City of New York</span>, 177 Fed. App'x. 195 (2d. Cir. 2006) (harassment based on heterosexual male employee's failure to conform to his employer's stereotypes for men can state claim of sex discrimination); <span class="Italic">Medina v. Income Support Div</span>., 413 F.3d 1131, 1135 (10th Cir. 2005) (involving a heterosexual female who alleged that her lesbian supervisor discriminated against her on the basis of sex, and finding that "a plaintiff may satisfy her evidentiary burden [under Title VII] by showing that the harasser was acting to punish the plaintiff's noncompliance with gender stereotypes"); <span class="Italic">Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio</span>, 378 F.3d 566, 574 (6th Cir. 2004) (sex stereotyping based on a person's gender non-conforming behavior is impermissible discrimination, irrespective of the cause of that behavior, and a label such as "transsexual," is not fatal to such a claim of discrimination); <span class="Italic">Simonton v. Runyon</span>, 232 F.3d 33, 37 (2d Cir. 2000) (indicating that a gay man would have a viable Title VII claim if "the abuse he suffered was discrimination based on sexual stereotypes, which may be cognizable as discrimination based on sex").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has also recognized the viability of such sex stereotyping claims. <span class="Italic">See Macy, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Veretto v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110873 (July 1, 2011); <span class="Italic">Castello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520110649 (Dec. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Baker, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an example of sex stereotyping in this case, Complainant believes she was discriminated against when she was counseled numerous times for taking her breaks and her lunch with another female, who was also a lesbian, and was told by her supervisor that it was creating an "improper perception." In other words, Complainant is alleging that the supervisor was motivated by his attitudes about stereotypes that women should only have relationships with men, and that two lesbians seen together created an "improper perception" that goes against that gender stereotype. <span class="Italic">See Castello, supra</span> (Complainant's allegation that she was discriminated against based on her sexual orientation states a claim of sex discrimination because Complainant essentially argued that her supervisor was motivated by the sexual stereotype that having relationships with men is an essential part of being a woman). This is sufficient to state a claim that Complainant was discriminated against for failure to match gender-conforming behavior and thus state a claim based on sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Commission has jurisdiction over this complaint and the AJ was correct in denying the Agency's motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission ruling on the merits of the case also found that the complainant failed to demonstrate prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Brooker v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520110680 (2013), where the complainant alleged that he was subject to harassment in the form of coworkers making comments about his sexual orientation including that he was gay and frequented gay bars. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brooker</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant is alleging discrimination based on his sex rather than sexual orientation. The record reflects that Complaint is alleging that coworkers were spreading false rumors about him. As such, based on a review of the record, we find that Complainant is alleging discrimination based on his sex, which is a covered basis under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Couch v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120131136 (2013), the Commission still drew a distinction between discrimination based on the complainant's perceived sexual orientation and gender stereotyping:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency accepted Complainant's claims as allegations of discrimination on the bases of national origin, age, sex (male, gender stereotyping), perceived sexual orientation, and reprisal. The Agency asserted in its final decision that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over claims of perceived sexual orientation discrimination. As an initial matter, we note that the Commission has previously found that as long as the allegations state a viable claim of sex discrimination, the fact that a Complainant has characterized the basis of discrimination as sexual orientation does not defeat an otherwise valid sex discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110008 (Jan. 11, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII does not explicitly include sexual orientation as a basis for protection under the law. Nevertheless, the law's broad prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of...sex" will offer coverage to gay individuals in certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">Baker, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Supreme Court has recognized, Title VII's prohibition on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of "gender." <span class="Italic">Macy v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt">0120120821</a> (April 20, 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989)). This includes discrimination because an individual fails to conform to gender-based expectations, stereotypical or otherwise. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although we are not bound by federal circuit court precedent in Title VII for purposes of our adjudication of federal sector complaints, we note that, since <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, every court of appeals has recognized that disparate treatment for failing to conform to gender-based expectations is sex discrimination and has also concluded that this principle applies with equal force in cases involving plaintiffs who are gay, bisexual, heterosexual, or transgender. <span class="Italic">See Prowel v.

App'x. 195 (2d Cir. 2006) (harassment based on heterosexual male employee's <span id="Page_865"></span>failure to conform to his employer's stereotypes for men can state claim of sex discrimination); <span class="Italic">Dawson v. Bumble &#x0026; Bumble</span>, 398 F.3d 211, 218 (2d Cir. 2005) (Employees who face adverse employment actions as a result of their employer's animus toward their exhibition of behavior considered to be stereotypically inappropriate for their gender may have a claim under Title VII); <span class="Italic">Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio</span>, 378 F.3d 566, 572 (6th Cir. 2004) (allegation that plaintiff was harassed for "not being masculine enough" stated a claim of discrimination on the bases of sex stereotyping); <span class="Italic">Doe by Doe v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has also recognized the viability of such sex stereotyping claims. <span class="Italic">See Macy, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Veretto v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110873 (July 1, 2011); <span class="Italic">Castello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520110649 (Dec. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Baker, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., the Supreme Court established that Title VII prohibits actionable sex-based harassment even when the perpetrator and the victim are the same sex. 523 U.S. 75, at 79 (1998) ("Nothing in Title VII necessarily bars a claim of discrimination 'because of...sex' merely because the plaintiff and the [perpetrator] are of the same sex.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that his male co-workers constantly referred to him as "fag" "faggot" and "gay," his personal gun bag and gun tag were defaced with the words "Rat Fag" and "God Loves Rat Fags To[o]" and sexually explicit gay magazines were left in Agency vehicles where Complainant would find them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the words "fag" and "faggot" have been historically used in the United States as a highly offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithet against gay men. Additionally, the words "fag" and "faggot" are offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithets historically used when a person is displaying their belief that a male is not as masculine or as manly as they are. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc</span>., 256 F.3d 864, 870, 875 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that verbal abuse, including the use of the epithet "faggot," occurred because of sex). The Commission has previously taken this position in a brief docketed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on December 12, 2011, where it stated that words such as "faggot" are degrading sex-based epithets. EEOC Appellate Brief in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Boh Brothers Construction Company, L.L.C</span>., No. 11-30770, at 5 (5th Cir. Dec. 12, 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that Complainant's claim of harassment based on his "perceived sexual orientation" is a claim of discrimination based on the perception that he does not conform to gender stereotypes of masculinity, and therefore states a viable claim under Title VII's sex discrimination prohibition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction was again drawn in <span class="Italic">Winters v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120121354 (2013), where the complainant alleged that agency officials had kept her from applying for an internship checked the box for sex discrimination and then wrote "orientation" next to the box. The complainant, who had previously interned for the agency alleged that during her second internship she was assigned to a locker area with a male because the agency assumed she was working with a "male tool kit." In finding that the complainant was alleging a form of gender stereotyping in <span class="Italic">Winters</span> the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant appealed explaining that her complaint alleged that Agency officials purposely obstructed her ability to apply for the internship opportunity based on sex discrimination and her prior EEO activity, resulting in her not be considered/selected for the position. Complainant claimed that the responsible Agency officials were familiar with her due to her prior internships and previous EEO activity. She believes they actively prevented her from being able to successfully apply for the position online. In explaining her sex discrimination claim, Complainant clarified that she was not claiming discrimination due to sexual orientation, but sex stereotyping. In support of this claim, she indicated that she had previously worked as an intern with the Agency and was assigned to the women's locker room initially. However, during a second internship, she was assigned to a locker area with a male student. At that time, she asserted that the Agency made assumptions that she was "working with a man's tool kit" and acted accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the appeal, the Agency argued for the first time that the complaint alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation and that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over such a complaint. Further, the Agency challenged Complainant's assertion that Agency officials blocked Complainant's application for the internship program. The Agency argued that several Agency officials attempted to help her, but Complainant could not set up an account on <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">www.usajobs.gov</a>. Therefore, the Agency contends that its dismissal of the complaint was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Agency asserted that Agency officials helped, not hindered, Complainant in her attempts to apply for the internship, we find that such an argument addresses the merits of Complainant's complaint without a proper investigation as required by the regulations. We find that the Agency's articulated reason for the action in dispute--that Agency officials assisted Complainant--goes to the merits of Complainant's complaint, and is irrelevant to the procedural issue of whether she has stated a justiciable claim under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Osborne v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960111 (July 19, 1996); <span class="Italic">Lee v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05930220 (Aug. 12, 1993); <span class="Italic">Ferrazzoli v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05910642 (Aug. 15, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency has argued on appeal for the first time that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the claim of discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Commission has found that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals may bring claims of discrimination under Title VII in certain circumstances, including sex stereotyping. <span class="Italic">See Macy v. Dept. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt">0120120821</a> (April 20, 2012), <span class="Italic">citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120110008 (Jan. 11, 2013); <span class="Italic">Veretto v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120110873 (July 1, 2011). Complainant indicated that during prior internships, management took actions based on their perception of her sex and whether she conformed to stereotypes based on her sex. Upon review, we find that Complainant has asserted a claim of sex stereotyping within the purview of Title VII. Based on a review of the complaint, we find that Complainant's claim of discrimination is properly raised with the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was obtained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120110145 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency erred by dismissing outright Complainant's claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation when, among other things, she maintained that she was harassed when a supervisor told her he heard from members of the Design Development group that she was a "lesbian," overheard comments that she hates men, and later asked Complainant whether she was married to a woman. The Complainant is alleging that the Agency discriminated against her because she failed to conform with the sex stereotypes of her fellow employees, namely that women who date women must hate men or that women who marry other women are not "normal." That is sufficient to state a sex discrimination claim under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120120387 (2015) (complainant alleged gender stereotyping discrimination and not sexual orientation discrimination); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132452 (2014) ("the words 'fag' and 'faggot' are offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithets historically used when a person is displaying their belief that a male is not as masculine or as manly as they are.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission has not specifically held that sexual orientation is covered by Title VII's ban on sex discrimination but has used the gender stereotyping analysis liberally, the Commission has held that terms like "homo," and "faggot" are "highly offensive." In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120133382 (2015), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 22, 2013, Complainant filed a formal EEO complaint alleging that the Agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of sex (male) when management failed to investigate and properly deal with an incident of harassment that occurred on May 10, 2013. Specifically, Complainant alleged that a coworker, who was angry with him over a work-related matter, called Complainant a "homo," and said that he was "living in sin, and that he would be going to hell." Complainant alleged that he immediately reported the incident to his supervisor, who he said essentially did nothing other than tell both employees to stay away from each other and criticize Complainant for responding to the coworker by questioning whether he was a good Christian for saying such things. In his July 2013 complaint, Complainant also alleged that since he reported this incident, management and the coworker have engaged in a continuing pattern of retaliatory harassment. In his complaint, however, he did not provide specific details of the alleged retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not all claims of harassment are actionable. However, the Commission has held that, under certain circumstances, a limited number of highly offensive slurs or comments may in fact state a claim or support a finding of discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996). In this case, we find that the hateful nature of the alleged comments made on May 10, 2013, coupled with the alleged lack of adequate response on the part of management, was sufficiently severe to state a viable claim of harassment due to gender-based stereotyping that requires further investigation and processing. <span class="Italic">See Couch v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131136 (August 13, 2013); (noting that certain terms applied to homosexual individuals such as "fag" or "faggot" have been historically used in the United States as highly offensive, insulting and degrading sex-based epithets against gay men or lesbian women who are perceived as failing to conform to gender stereotypes); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No 0120132452 (November 18, 2014) (same).</p>
