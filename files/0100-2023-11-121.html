<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-121"><span class="space">A.</span> <span id="Page_129"></span>CONSTRUCTIVE RECEIPT OF NOTICE</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has employed the doctrine of constructive notice to a complainant's receipt of the notice of final interview. If the agency can prove that the notice of final interview was delivered to a member of the complainant's family or household who is of suitable age and discretion, this constitutes constructive receipt of the notice by the complainant and the time frame for filing a formal complaint begins to run, unless the complainant is represented by an attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency does rely on constructive notice of receipt of the notice of final interview, it must provide evidence showing that the complainant, or someone at her residence, received the notice. In <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A22224 (2002), the Commission held that a delivery confirmation from Federal Express was insufficient to show actual receipt of the notice, in the absence of a signature acknowledging receipt.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Matthews-El v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A20547 (2002), the Commission applied a similar holding in a case involving a confirmed delivery of the notice of final interview. In finding the time period for filing a formal complaint did not begin to run merely because a letter carrier confirmed delivery, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Matthews-El</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the agency's request for reconsideration the agency maintains that a letter carrier servicing complainant's route delivered the notice of right to file a formal complaint to complainant's address on June 14, 2001, as evidenced by the Carrier Certification of Delivery contained in the record. The Commission notes that although the letter carrier certified the delivery, there is no signature either by complainant or another individual indicating receipt of this document on that date. In her prior appeal of the agency's final decision and in response to the agency's request for reconsideration, complainant denies that she received the notice of right to file on June 14, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We contrast the instant case with <span class="Italic">Woehr v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960657 (July 3, 1997), in which the Commission found that it acted with due diligence to provide complainant with a copy of an appeal decision by mailing it to the complainant twice, which resulted in six attempts to deliver the decision over a two-month period of time<span class="Italic">. See Kaiser v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980414 (June 22, 2000). There is no evidence in this record that the agency tried to notify complainant of her right to file a formal complaint on different occasions after the alleged delivery on June 14, 2001, or through other means, including sending the notice via regular mail. The Commission determines that under the circumstances, the agency did not act with due diligence in order to deliver the appropriate rights to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that in the instant case, carrier certified delivery is insufficient to prove receipt of the notice of right to file. Actual receipt of a document is generally necessary to begin the running of a regulatory time limit<span class="Italic">. See Woehr v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960657 (July 3, 1997). Since the carrier certified delivery did not prove receipt, we conclude that the 15 day limitation period did not start to run on June 14, 2001 as advanced by the agency; rather, the limitation period began to run on August 14, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Joyant v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955888 (1996), the Commission indicated that an agency may rely on the doctrine of constructive notice. However, the Commission also found that when the agency does rely on constructive notice to dismiss a complaint as untimely, it must specifically advise the complainant of that fact in the final agency decision. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Joyant</span>, this is the only way to give the complainant a fair opportunity to rebut the presumption of constructive receipt:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the Notice of Right to File Individual Complaint was delivered to appellant's home address by registered mail and received on May 9, 1995. It is unclear based upon the present record, who signed for the notice. The Commission has previously held that receipt of a document at a complainant's correct address by a member of the complainant's family or household of suitable age and discretion constitutes constructive receipt by the complainant<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Bauchand v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920389 (May 29, 1992) (receipt of a document by a member of appellant's family of suitable age and discretion is effective receipt by appellant); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910895 (March 11, 1992) (receipt of a document by a member of appellant's family or household at appellant's home address is effective receipt by appellant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a certified U.S. Postal Service return receipt has been signed by an unidentified individual at the complainant's address on a date certain to indicate delivery of an important document, the Commission has effectively relied upon the certified receipt to establish a presumption of constructive receipt of the document by the complainant on that date<span class="Italic">. See Pazinick v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930337 (September 10, 1993); <span class="Italic">Knowles v. Dept. of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920956 (March 18, 1993). This presumption, however, is a rebuttable one. A complainant may present evidence on appeal before the Commission to rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the individual who signed for her mail was not a family or household member of suitable age or discretion to do so<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Baunchand, supra</span>, (request granted because appellant had demonstrated that the final agency decision had been improperly delivered to an 11-year old cousin at an outdated address).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, equity demands that a complainant be provided with adequate notice that this presumption of constructive receipt is being relied upon to dismiss her complaint as untimely in order to provide her with a full and fair opportunity to rebut it on appeal before the Commission. Therefore, the Commission has held that when an agency elects to dismiss a complaint on timeliness grounds, relying on a certified receipt signed by an individual other than the complainant, it shall advise the complainant, in its final agency decision, of the substance of the constructive receipt doctrine and that it is relying upon that doctrine to dismiss her complaint as untimely<span class="Italic">. Fontanella v. GSA</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940131 (April 10, 1995). There is no evidence of record to indicate that the agency advised appellant accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent">The presumption of constructive receipt when the notice of final interview is signed for by someone at the complainant's address is rebuttable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Brent v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23715 (2002). The Commission also noted that the evidence was not entirely clear that the document for which the agency claimed constructive receipt was indeed the notice of final interview. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Glomski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955157 (1997) (when the agency relies on the constructive receipt of a final agency decision, it must put the complainant on notice that it is relying on constructive receipt).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission has more recently held that when a notice of right to file is sent to the complainant's last known address and is signed by someone that appellant does not know, the complainant is still deemed to have received it when he has not given the agency his new address. In <span class="Italic">Cross v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964547 (1997), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant states that the reason for his late filing was that the Notice was sent to his former address and was signed by someone, other than himself, who was living at that address.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it appears from appellant's statement on appeal, that during the relevant time period, he failed to notify the agency of his correct address. Therefore, under the principles set forth above, the Commission must affirm the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint for untimeliness.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Harbison v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971662 (1998), the Commission found that the agency failed to adequately refute the complainant's assertions that the agency's return receipt was signed by someone who did not live with him or accept mail for him:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Notices were mailed on August 9, 1996, to appellant's residence by certified mail, return receipt requested. The return receipt was signed and dated on August 15, 1996, by a female who appellant says does not live in his residence or accepts mail on his behalf. Appellant filed a formal complaint in an envelope which bears a postmark dated September 5, 1996. The agency dismissed appellant's complaint on the grounds of failure to file a formal complaint within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of a Notice of Final Interview and Notice of Right to File. The agency stated that the complaint was filed beyond the time allowed by the regulations. The agency dismissed the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant submits that the Notice of right to File was delivered on August 22, 1996. He states that the perforated ends of the return receipt were attached to the envelope, but the return receipt card was not attached. Appellant submits the envelope which has a notation on the front saying "Sent to wrong address." On appeal the agency asserts that appellant must have written the message on the envelope based on a comparison of the handwriting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record, the Commission finds that the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint as untimely was improper. The Commission finds that appellant has offered a notice of redelivery which is signed by appellant on August 22, 1996. The agency's assertion that appellant altered the envelope to show it was misdelivered is unsupported by persuasive objective evidence. Appellant has asserted that "no one resides at [his] address nor accepts mail for [him] by the name of [person A]." The agency has not submitted affidavits from any postal officials concerning the attempts to deliver the notice of right to file. We find that under the circumstances the agency has not satisfied its burden of showing that appellant's complaint was filed in an untimely manner. Thus the Commission finds that the appellant's complaint was timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the complainant must do more than merely assert that the signatory is not a family member of suitable age and discretion. In a case involving a demand for further information at the counseling stage, the Commission held the complainant did not rebut the presumption of constructive receipt when she avoided identifying the individual who did sign for the demand. In <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993812 (1999), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant has failed to rebut the presumption of constructive receipt. Specifically, appellant, during the investigation and on appeal, <span id="Page_130"></span>has failed to demonstrate that the individual who signed for the Demand Letter was not a family member. As the record reflects, appellant consistently avoided addressing the identity of the individual who signed for the letter. Therefore, not proving that they were not a family member. Moreover, throughout the investigation, appellant offered no new information other than by letter dated February 21, 1999 in which she claimed to have never received the Demand Letter. However, in support of her appeal, appellant now offers the explanation that she found out about the letter through a Union steward. Interestingly, appellant never offered this information to the agency, and even now, she offers no name, therefore making her assertion incapable of being confirmed. Appellant, in failing to provide the agency this crucial information during the investigation, has thwarted their efforts in unraveling the truth. Thereby, discrediting her veracity and thus causing her statements on appeal to be incredulous. For the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant has failed to rebut the presumption of constructive receipt. Accordingly, the agency's final decision dismissing appellant's complaint on the ground of failing to timely contact an EEO Counselor was proper and is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCabe v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963495 (1998), the Commission found that it would not apply the doctrine of constructive receipt to a notice of hearing rights when the notice was delivered to the complainant's mentally retarded son. The Commission in <span class="Italic">McCabe</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has not indicated the age of his son, only that his son is mentally retarded. The Commission does not suggest that mental retardation constitutes a lack of discretion <span class="Italic">per se</span>. However, where, as here, the individual in question lacked the sophistication to know that he was required to sign both his first and last name to the return receipt, the Commission finds it appropriate to infer a lack of discretion rendering appellant's son an inappropriate recipient for certified mail....</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement, however, that a child be mentally-impaired to be unsuitable to accept delivery. In <span class="Italic">Curtis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10483 (2001), the Commission found that receipt of the notice of final interview by the complainant's 10-year-old son did not constitute receipt by the complainant. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01990910 (1999), the Commission waived the time limit noting "that appellant's eleven-year old daughter is not a household member of suitable age and discretion to accept important legal documents."</p>
<p class="noindent">It should be no surprise that the Commission will not apply the doctrine of constructive receipt when the notice of final interview is left with a painter, who is not related to the complainant, at the complainant's home. <span class="Italic">Ojeda v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975075 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Moses v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973686 (1998) (notice delivered to the complainant's office and received by the complainant's secretary, who was not authorized to receive and sign for his personal mail). However, constructive receipt does apply when the notice is left with a designated housesitter. <span class="Italic">Butchart v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A35000 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">A spouse is not required to sign for a certified letter from an agency EEO office that he suspects will start the running of time period for filing a formal complaint where his wife is out of town and not available to timely file a complaint. In <span class="Italic">Calderone v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976639 (1998), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the husband should have signed for the letter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies should be on notice that when a complainant is represented by an attorney during counseling, the notice of final interview must be served on the attorney in addition to the complainant. Under 29 CFR 1614.605(d), once an agency is advised that a complainant is represented by an attorney, all notices must be served on the attorney.</p>
