<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-159"><span class="space">39.</span> Proposed Actions and Preliminary Steps</h4>
<p class="noindent">In order to be aggrieved, the employee must demonstrate that he suffered some injury, such as: loss of pay, denial of promotional opportunities, loss of seniority, or transfer to another job, or a change in the terms and conditions of employment. The proposal to take such actions itself does not cause sufficient injury to give the employee standing to file a complaint. <span class="Italic">See Jimenez v. USPS</span>, 01841372 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has codified its previous case law in this area by clearly stating that proposed actions are not within EEO purview and that an agency shall dismiss a complaint based on a proposed action, or "any other preliminary step to taking a personnel action." 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(5). The regulation goes beyond the scope of former 1613.215(a)(2), which only addressed proposed actions. In its section-by-section analysis to the 1992 amendments to Part 1614, the Commission explained its expansion of the provision to other preliminary steps of personnel actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We intend the section to require dismissal of complaints that allege discrimination in any preliminary steps to a personnel action that do not, without further action, affect the person; for example, progress reviews or improvement periods that are not part of any official file on the employee. If the individual alleges, however, that the preliminary step was taken for the purpose of harassing the individual for a prohibited reason, the complaint cannot be dismissed under this section because it has already affected the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Effective September 24, 2012, the Commission amended section (a)(5) to account for developments in reprisal law. The section currently provides that an agency shall dismiss a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action, is discriminatory, unless the complaint alleges that the proposal or preliminary step is retaliatory;</p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed more fully below in the section, "<a href="0100-2023-12-185.html#sec3-175">Standing: Failure to State a Claim--Hostile Environment</a>," a proposed action or preliminary step to an employment action may be included as part of an overall hostile environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110, at 5-25, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleges that a proposal to take or a preliminary step in taking a personnel action is discriminatory. This provision requires the dismissal of complaints that allege discrimination "in any preliminary steps that do not, without further action, affect the person: for example, progress reviews or improvement periods that are not a part of any official file on the employee." 57 Fed. Reg. 12,643 (Apr. 10, 1992); <span class="Italic">see, for example, McAlhaney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940949 (July 7, 1995). However, if the complaint alleges that a proposal to take or a preliminary step in taking a personnel action is retaliatory, the complaint should not be dismissed because a proposed action could be considered adverse treatment in the context of reprisal if it is reasonably likely to deter protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Dep't. of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120103139 (Dec. 8, 2010) (complainant's claim that the agency discriminated against him when it placed him on a performance improvement plan stated a viable claim of retaliation). In addition, if the individual alleges that the preliminary step was part of a pattern of harassing the individual for a prohibited reason, the complaint cannot be dismissed under this section because the preliminary step has already affected the employee. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Noone v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940422 (Jan. 23, 1995); <span class="Italic">see also Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111470 (Jan. 5, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">Formerly, the Commission had been plagued by dual complaints where an employee first initiated a complaint over the proposed action and then initiated a new complaint over the action as implemented. This resulted in the needless expenditure of agency resources in processing two complaints where one would suffice. The current regulations focus on whether the employee suffers some adverse impact as a result of the preliminary steps of a personnel action. This eliminates more needless complaints. Employees, however, still should be adequately protected by the Commission's inclusion of the preliminary steps of a personnel action when those steps are taken for the purpose of harassing or retaliating against an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Felix R. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120171389 (2017) (reversing the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim and finding that a fair reading of the complainant's allegations that his supervisor threatened to discipline him raised a claim of harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee does state a complaint within EEO purview when the proposed action is accompanied by another action that causes the employee harm. In <span class="Italic">Estrada v. USPS</span>, 01861743 (1986), the employee was given a fitness-for-duty examination and, as a result, taken off his normal duties and given the option of requesting light duty, a reassignment, or retirement. The Commission found the employee was an aggrieved person within the meaning of Title VII since he had been denied the right to continue his regular duty assignments and was being required to make a choice on his future employment. Under the circumstances, the employee did not have to wait until the effective date of any job change. Though in most cases, the notice to report for a fitness-for-duty examination would be viewed as a proposed action, in <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984841 (1999), the Commission found the notice caused sufficient harm where it ordered the employee to report for the examination on Veterans Day. In <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, the Commission found,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">that the issuance of the notice to report for a fitness-for-duty examination on Veterans Day, a Federal holiday, constitutes alleged harassment even if the date of the examination was subsequently changed. The appellant may prevail on his harassment claim if he can prove that he was subjected to a discriminatory hostile work environment....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Calder v. Attorney General</span>, 01984342 (1999) (notice of poor performance is preliminary action, but aggrieves employee when accompanied by a reassignment to a new position). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Kalra v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A03263 (2001) (no claim was stated where the employee alleges that his removal was proposed, but subsequently accepts a position of the same grade, pay and benefits in lieu of removal).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Alline B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120181832 (2018), the Commission held that a proposed disciplinary action coupled with other acts of harassment stated a claim upon with relief could be granted. "If a proposed action is purportedly combined with other acts of harassment to form an alleged pattern of harassment, the agency may not properly dismiss it as a proposed action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Simms v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0210102846 (2011), the Commission found that an "option" letter, combined with placement on light duty and removal of the complainant's firearm constituted a sufficient injury to state a claim. The complainant, an insulin-dependent diabetic, was a Customs and Border Patrol officer who was found unfit for duty and given a letter that gave him the option of choosing between reassignment or retirement as an alternative to removal. The agency also placed the complainant on light duty and took his firearm from him. In reversing the agency's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim, the Commission contrasted the case with <span class="Italic">Lindsay v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120071847 (2007), where it held that a similar "option" letter was a preliminary step to a personnel action. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Simms</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(5) provides, in part, for the dismissal of a complaint that "alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action, is discriminatory." In his formal complaint, Complainant alleged that he faced discrimination when he was given an "option" letter and his firearm and duties were removed. The Agency cites precedent for the dismissal of the complaint, relying heavily on <span class="Italic">Lindsey</span> to argue that an "option" letter is merely a proposal to take a personnel action. In the cited cases, the Commission has only upheld the dismissal of a complaint based on a proposed action when no subsequent action has been taken. In <span class="Italic">Lindsey,</span> the individual was given an "option" letter and nothing further occurred. <span id="Page_236"></span>In this instance, however, Complainant alleged that the Agency took a subsequent action in furtherance of the "option" letter. Specifically, Complainant alleged that, after informing him that he was unfit for duty and allowing him to choose between reassignment, retirement, or discharge, the Agency then put him on "light duty" and removed his firearm. The dismissal of this complaint is therefore improper, as Complainant has alleged that he suffered a harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05931049 (Apr. 21, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, when the proposed action is later used as the basis for some other personnel action, then the complainant has been sufficiently aggrieved by the proposed action to state a claim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Strange v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971832 (1997), the employee filed a complaint over a proposed letter of warning. The Commission found the agency erred in dismissing the complaint because the employee alleged the proposed letter of warning was mentioned as one of the reasons for a later lowered performance evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a proposed personnel action prompts an employee to seek EEO counseling does not necessarily justify dismissing the complaint as challenging a proposed action. In <span class="Italic">Donlin v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01941857 (1994), the employee sought counseling after being issued notice of a proposed three-day suspension. The employee alleged that the agency was not giving full consideration to his disability of hypoglycemia and its impact on his ability to do his job. As an example of this failure, the employee cited the denial of a within-grade increase. The Commission determined the employee was not trying to challenge the proposed suspension, but, instead, was alleging an overall failure of the agency to afford him reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency cannot rely on a previous decision dismissing an allegation because it challenges a proposed action once the action is effected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dripps v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01991909 (2001); <span class="Italic">Kuo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01962756 (1996). Once the action becomes effective, the complaint over the proposed action is deemed merged with the complaint over the action itself. <span class="Italic">See Cripe v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A11245 (2002). If the action has been appealed to the MSPB, the complaint should be dismissed under the mixed case regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>; s<span class="Italic">ee also</span> <span class="Italic">Bailey-Jones v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A02365 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">An action is not deemed to be in the proposal stage where, depending on the employee's decision, some action will be taken. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01982463 (1999), the Commission reversed an agency dismissal of a complaint over what the agency contended was a proposed reassignment. The agency proposed to reassign the complainant from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco. If the employee declined the reassignment, he was informed that, at a minimum, he would be reassigned to a different position. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> held the action was not proposed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the May 2, 1996 reassignment was not a proposed action, since it was notice that appellant had to vacate his present position; when appellant declined the reassignment to San Francisco, he was offered a lower graded position in Washington, D.C., indicating that he was going to be reassigned, if not to California, then at least to a different position. Clearly, a term or condition of appellant's employment was affected by the actions in question, i.e., he was reassigned to a lower grade position<span class="Italic">. See Diaz v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1991). The agency failed to address the entire scope of appellant's claim; declining the offered reassignment to California resulted in his reassignment to a lower grade position.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01985782 (1999) (a letter advising an employee that she could retire or resign, or her position would be abolished and she would be separated in several months constitutes harm).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Perry v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01990766 (2000), the Commission found the complainant failed to state a claim where he alleged that he was detailed to a position on the basis of sex. In upholding dismissal of the complaint, the Commission noted the complainant was on sick leave during the entire period of the detail and, because he never physically reported to the detail position, suffered no harm. Just because an action is never put into effect does not necessarily mean that the complainant is not sufficiently aggrieved. In <span class="Italic">James R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120182646 (2018), the Commission held that a notice of involuntary reassignment, even though later rescinded, stated a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has stated a viable claim. Here, the reassignment position was located in West Falls, Texas which is 50 miles away from Complainant's current office located in Vernon, Texas. We emphasis that the claim does not relate to an assignment of different duties within the same work site. Instead, the reassignment in this case would require Complainant to relocate to a different city after having worked in the same post office for the past 42 years. Additionally, Complainant alleges that management issued the reassignment to "force [him] into retirement due to [his] age (60) and 42 years of service." Complainant further alleges that another coworker ("CW1") who lived in a city closer to West Falls was initially hired for the Vernon vacancy position, but "management conspired to ensure that [CW1] was in a different position before acting on the reassignment." Finally, Complainant alleges that management has not provided him the same accommodations as management has provided other coworkers who were younger and who had fewer years of service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the reassignment created personal loss related to a term, condition, or privilege of Complainant's employment even though the Agency rescinded the reassignment. Complainant states that the Agency issued the reassignment on April 16, 2018 and due to occupational stress, Complainant began taking medical leave on May 2, 2018, and has not returned to work since this date. Thus, the notice of the assignment effected Complainant before the Agency rescinded the reassignment on May 11, 2018--one day before the reassignment became effective on May 12, 2018. Therefore, Complainant was an aggrieved employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">The actions of barring a complainant from an agency facility and placing him on administrative leave pending a decision on a proposed removal are not "inextricably intertwined" with the proposed removal. Such actions do not form the basis of any decision to remove the complainant. Thus, the agency erred in dismissing a complaint over those issues as being part of a proposed action. <span class="Italic">Ranier v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a52974.txt">01A52974</a> (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Removal of the complainant from an eligibility certificate following a suitability determination is not a proposed or preliminary action. Removal from the certificate precluded the complainant from being considered for the position at issue and constituted a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Horton v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A13507 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In an interesting scenario, the Commission found that an allegation that the complainant was warned that if he went to many more minority conferences he would receive a low performance evaluation stated a claim for relief. In <span class="Italic">Nurriddin v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 01986670 (1999), the Commission found the complaint did not concern a proposed action because, if true, the threat essentially placed the complainant in a "Catch 22" situation because he was responsible for recruiting job applicants for the agency in underrepresented categories. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Nurriddin</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">that if someone in the appellant's chain of command made the threats as alleged, then the appellant was placed in a precarious situation. If he did not decrease the number of minority conferences he was attending, his performance appraisal would be lowered. However, if the appellant heeded the alleged warning and decreased the number of minority conferences he was attending, then his performance appraisal could be lowered for not performing the required outreach activities to national organizations representing African American, Native American, Hispanic, disabled, and women interests in science, engineering and technology education and careers. For this reason, the Commission finds that the alleged statements, to the extent that they occurred, appear to have altered the terms and conditions of the appellant's employment. In so finding, the Commission notes in particular that allegedly the appellant was warned about attending too many "minority" conferences, not just too many conferences in general. The Commission finds, therefore, that allegation 3 does not concern a proposed action, but rather, an action which allegedly already has occurred, i.e., an apparent alteration in the terms and conditions of the appellant's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is improper for an agency to dismiss an allegation concerning a proposed adverse action when the complainant alleges the proposal is part of an overall pattern of harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01930869 (1993). In that case, a proposed removal was one of six specific incidents that the complainant maintained was part of a hostile work environment. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the allegation, noting that the complainant alleged she was aggrieved by the overall work environment. However, the employee must allege that the proposed action is accompanied by some other incidents of harassment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hall v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01973372 (1998), the complainant alleged that she was harassed regarding a midterm appraisal, but since there was nothing else on which she based her harassment claim, the Commission found that dismissal was proper. But, where the complainant alleges that, over a period of several months, the agency repeatedly threatened to issue proposed actions as a form of harassment, this states a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McSween v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01983107 (1999) (complainant alleged that a supervisor repeatedly threatened him with unreasonable deadlines and lowered performance ratings as a form of harassment); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Baumann v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976189 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">The reason for permitting complainants to pursue threatened disciplinary actions when it is contended that the threatened action is taken for the purpose of harassment is that, unlike most proposed actions where the injury is speculative, harassment already has had a tangible effect on the complainant. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Sloan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954307 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant alleged that she was discriminated against when she was issued a letter instructing her to cease intervening and not to interfere with the Grant Post Office operation and threatening her with disciplinary action if she failed to comply. Clearly, such a letter impacted upon a term, condition, or privilege of appellant's employment. Appellant further stated that she believed the letter was part of a pattern of harassment. Where, as in this case, the complainant alleges that a proposal to take some action, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a threat of future disciplinary action, was for the purpose of harassment, we have found that the identified action has <span id="Page_237"></span>already affected the complainant.... Accordingly, we find that appellant's complaint states a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The bar against dismissing complaints over proposed disciplinary actions based on harassment should not be interpreted to apply solely to claims of reprisal. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Masarone v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01941765 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n agency shall dismiss a complaint or portion thereof which alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action is discriminatory. In the case at hand, appellant admitted that the agency rescinded the removal on August 18, 1993. However, a review of the EEO Counselor's report, and appellant's formal complaint reveals that appellant specifically alleged that the agency proposed to take action against her solely for purposes of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserted that only claims of reprisal discrimination which are made with regard to proposed actions are acceptable for processing. However, the language in the Preamble to the new EEOC Regulations provided that complaints involving proposed actions cannot be dismissed under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(e) if an individual alleges that the action was taken for the purpose of harassing the individual for a prohibited reason. Analysis of Section 107(e) of 29 CFR Part 1614, 57 Fed. Reg. at 12643 (April 10, 1992). It is noted that neither the Regulations nor the Preamble limit the acceptable bases to reprisal. Instead, the language of the Preamble includes allegations of harassment raised with regard to any prohibited basis. The EEO Counselor's report reveals that at the time appellant initiated the complaint herein, she had two prior EEO complaints pending which involved two of the named responsible officials herein. In addition, appellant's prior complaints involved allegations of harassment. Accordingly, based upon a review of the record, the agency's decision to dismiss sex, age, and disability as bases for appellant's complaint was improper pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(e), and is REVERSED, and those bases are hereby REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with the applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although placement on a performance improvement plan is normally a preliminary step to a personnel action and does not aggrieve an employee, an agency errs when it separates the PIP claim from the overall hostile environment claim and dismisses the PIP claim as a preliminary step to a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120130101 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">Placement on an "unfunded list" is not a personnel action where no action is required at that time. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01991911 (2002); <span class="Italic">Tence v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05930993 (1994). Since the agency may remove the employee from the list if funding later becomes available, such an action is akin to a proposed action and does not constitute an injury sufficient to aggrieve the complainant. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">McSweeny v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01966818 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has vacillated on whether an interim performance appraisal is considered a proposed action. OriGINAlly, the Commission held such appraisals cause sufficient injury to be the subject of an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See Marsh v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01893300 (1989). Interim performance appraisals were considered written documents evaluating performance that could be used in issuing future appraisals. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Alva v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01932048 (1993) (holding that a midyear review only aggrieves an employee when it is alleged that the review is part of a larger pattern of harassment). The Commission's treatment of interim performance reviews continues to be inconsistent. In <span class="Italic">Gasparick v. Secretary</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01932511 (1993), the Commission found that the employee was aggrieved by a negative inspection report "which became part of his official record and which can be cited in an official performance review." But in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01974029 (1998), the Commission held that the lowering of a performance rating caused no harm where the agency, before finalizing the rating, upgraded it to its oriGINAl level. See Chapter 18, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-27-068.html#sec18-67">Midyear Reviews</a>," discussing further interim performance appraisals.</p>
<p class="noindent">Apparently, in the Commission's view, if a higher-level supervisor overrules a subordinate supervisor on a performance appraisal this sufficiently aggrieves the subordinate supervisor for purposes of stating a claim. <span class="Italic">See Posey v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A13405 (2002), holding that an allegation that the subordinate supervisor's authority was undermined by the change in the performance appraisal stated a claim for relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 05931177 (1994), the Commission articulated a two-prong test for determining whether an action is preliminary in nature. First, the action must be only a preliminary step to a future action, and second, any record of the preliminary action must not cause present harm to the employee. The Commission found that records of the action do not constitute a present harm unless they become official records upon which others may rely:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Section of our regulations recognizes the propriety of agency actions focused on improving the performance of an employee. We exclude such actions from the EEO process so long as they have no present adverse effect on the employee. Underlying the Section is the premise that such an action does not render an employee an "aggrieved" person, one who has suffered direct personal deprivation at the hands of the employer. <span class="Italic">See Lori Arndt v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930583 (June 24, 1993). In order to dismiss a complaint pursuant to this Section, two discrete standards must be met: the act complained of must be merely a preliminary step to a future action, and any record of the act must not constitute a present harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision correctly characterized Category IV as a performance improvement program. As such, it is an "improvement period," one of the examples given by the Commission in its Analysis. The record also establishes that it is a preliminary category and that adverse employment actions such as downgrading or reassignment may not be taken at this time. Thus, if appellant's placement is not recorded in an official file on the appellant, her complaint was properly dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After examining the agency regulations governing the actions of the panel, the Commission finds that the record of appellant's placement in Category IV is not of the type that raises the issue of present harm to appellant. The previous decision found harm to appellant on the grounds that some record is maintained. However, given the performance improvement purpose of Category IV, the fact that appellant's Category IV placement is recorded somewhere is not enough. In order to constitute a present harm to a complainant, the record must be in "any official file on the employee." Our concern here is with official records which could be available to personnel other than the personnel responsible for the challenged act. <span class="Italic">Cf. Arndt, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the placement is not recorded in appellant's official file. The records of the panel do maintain a record of her placement for three years. However, these records are not available to officials outside the Career Service panel, except to the head of the Career Service, the official responsible for responding to inquiries from employees regarding their Career Service standing and for counseling employees. This official receives the formal, written report of the panel. Since the regulations speak in the singular regarding the report, and the report compares members of the Career Service, we find that the report is not the type of official record that is "on the employee," as the employee is not the sole subject of the report and the report would not be maintained by the employee's name. The panel may also develop worksheets and memoranda, each of which does appear to pertain to an individual employee. However, these too are not available to anyone outside the panel other than the head of the Career Service, again, for the purpose of informing or counseling employees. In short, the records are available only to the panel that decided to place appellant in Category IV, and to the official responsible for her counseling. Because of this restricted access, and because of the absence of records on appellant that could be available to other personnel, the records kept by the panel do not cause a present harm to appellant. The Commission finds that information kept in such panel records does not render an employee aggrieved.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a counseling is memorialized in writing, it constitutes more than a mere proposal to take a personnel action, and can therefore be the basis of a complaint. In <span class="Italic">Morano v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A02726 (2000), the Commission explained the basis for this distinction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the counseling memorandum reveals that it describes in narrative form complainant's resistance and reluctance to accept the temporary assignment. It assesses her "first phase" performance as "marGINAl to substandard," and her "second phase" as "less than fully successful," indicating that she lacked initiative and enthusiasm. The memorandum is formally prepared, on the agency's official stationary, and signed by the District Counsel. It was issued to complainant during a discussion regarding her alleged poor attitude and performance during the temporary assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has consistently held that discussions wherein a supervisor verbally cautions an employee that certain conduct is unacceptable and may result in an adverse action, without more, does not render the employee aggrieved<span class="Italic">. See Miranda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920308 (June 11, 1992). However, when a written record is created memorializing this type of discussion, the Commission has held that such complaints do state a claim<span class="Italic">. See Acey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965363 (August 18, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the counseling memorandum is formally prepared, and has both tone and content to suggest a reprimand as opposed to a preliminary performance evaluation (which distinguishes it from the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> case referenced in the FAD), and as such we find that complainant is aggrieved<span class="Italic">. See also Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970713 (August 14, 1997). We also find that because the counseling memorandum was used to lower two provisional evaluations, which complainant had to challenge to have revised, and because the District Counsel told her that he planned to use it to lower her May 2000 annual evaluation, these identified harms are not mere speculation. Instead, we find that complainant is presently aggrieved by the District Counsel's use of the counseling memorandum.</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that an employee has been subjected to an internal affairs investigation due to EEO activity states a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Carney v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01951773 (1996). It is of no consequence that the investigation <span id="Page_238"></span>found the charges were without merit and no discipline was imposed. In recent years, however, the Commission has departed from the view expressed in <span class="Italic">Carney</span> and dismissing such complaints as collateral attacks on other proceedings. See section below on "<a href="0100-2023-12-114.html#sec3-113">Failure to State a Claim: Investigations and Other Proceedings--Collateral Attacks</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's selection of a candidate for approval by OPM is a final personnel action on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01960034 (1996). For example, in the Senior Executive Service (SES) selection process, the selecting official makes the final decision within the agency's control, but OPM's approval is required. Whether OPM approves that decision does not affect the status of the agency's selection decision as a personnel action. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lack of a viable remedy is one of the reasons behind the Commission's regulation directing dismissal of complaints alleging proposed actions. In this case, however, there is a remedy available to the complainant. If he were to prevail on his complaint by proving discrimination, he could be remedied by his selection as the agency's candidate for the position in question, subject to the approval of OPM. This would place him in the same position as others on the best qualified list.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Craig v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01956925 (1996), the Commission held that the complainant's fully qualified rating (as opposed to best qualified) was not a preliminary step to a future action: not only was he denied the opportunity to be selected for the position, but a female candidate was selected to fill the position of comptroller. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Craig</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the female employee was not certified by OPM and as a result, the agency is still engaged in the process of selecting a Comptroller, the record shows that because of the complainant's rating he will not receive any further consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, the Commission held that an agency's decision not to interview a candidate for promotion is a concrete action that eliminates that candidate from consideration. As a result, it is not a preliminary or proposed action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">York v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01984242 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">A medical suitability determination is not a final action until the employee requests and receives a reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">Carter v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A24634 (2003).</p>
