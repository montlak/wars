<section>
<p class="noindent">An agency's processing of an EEO complaint ends when it takes "final action." The nature of the agency's final action will depend on whether the complaint has been dismissed under 29 CFR 1614.107(a), the complainant has timely requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge, or has requested a final agency decision (FAD). An agency must also take final action on allegations of breach of settlement agreements, as well as allegation that it has failed to comply with final Commission order. Once the complainant requests a hearing, assuming the request is timely, he or she is entitled to a decision by an administrative judge regardless of whether a hearing is held. The only exception to this rule is if the complainant withdraws his or her request for a hearing and material facts remain in dispute. In such situations, the administrative judge must remand the complaint to the agency for a final agency decision. As discussed in Chapter 6 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-15-079.html#sec6-80">Summary Judgment</a>," an administrative judge may issue a decision without a hearing if he or she determines the complaint should be dismissed under 29 CFR 1614.107(a), or determines there are no material facts in dispute under 29 CFR 1614.109(g). If there has been a decision by an administrative judge, the agency will take final action by issuing an order that either: (1) implements fully the decision of the administrative judge; or (2) does not implement fully the decision of the administrative judge. In the latter instance, the agency must file an appeal of the administrative judge's decision with the EEOC Office of Federal Operations simultaneous to issuing the order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.110(a). If the complainant has not requested a hearing with an administrative judge, has requested a decision on the record, or if the agency fully dismisses the complaint for any of the reasons set forth in 29 CFR 1614.107, the agency will take final action by issuing a final agency decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.110(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110, at 1-3, defines the following terms:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"<span class="Italic">Final Agency Action</span>" refers to an agency's last and final action on a complaint of employment discrimination. The final agency action may be in the form of a final agency decision, a final agency order implementing an Administrative Judge's decision, or a final determination on a breach of settlement agreement claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"<span class="Italic">Final Agency Decision</span>" refers to a decision on a complaint of discrimination made by the agency, without an Administrative Judge, that is appealable to the Commission. It includes agency decisions to dismiss or agency decisions on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"<span class="Italic">Final Agency Order</span>" refers to a decision by an agency to implement or not implement an Administrative Judge's decision, which is appealable to the Commission. Where the agency's final order does not fully implement the Administrative Judge's decision, the agency must simultaneously appeal to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"<span class="Italic">Final Agency Determination</span>" refers to an agency determination as to whether there was a breach of a settlement agreement that is appealable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the 1999 amendments to Part 1614, the Commission's administrative judges issued recommended decisions in those cases where hearings were requested. Upon receipt of the recommended decision, agencies issued final agency decisions (FADs) rejecting, accepting, or modifying the judge's decision. Agencies were free to simply ignore the administrative judges' decisions and write decisions with their own factual findings and legal conclusions. If the complainant was not satisfied with the final agency decision, it was incumbent upon him or her to file an appeal with OFO. Effective November 9, 1999, all of that changed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The current requirement that agencies in disagreement with administrative judges' decisions file appeals with OFO represents a compromise between the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> of the former Part 1614 and the 1998 notice of proposed rulemaking to amend Part 1614. In its notice of proposed rulemaking, 63 Fed. Reg. 8557 (1998), the Commission indicated its intention to give its administrative judges the authority to issue final decisions, subject to appeal by either the complainant or the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's change of heart was based, in large part, upon questions raised by agencies about the Commission's authority to strip agencies of final decisionmaking authority. Instead, the amended regulations require an agency rejecting the decision of an administrative judge to simultaneously file an appeal with OFO. Agencies retain the authority to issue a final order accepting or rejecting the judge's decision but, ultimately, bear the burden of defending rejections of decisions by administrative judges before the Office of Federal Operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its comments with the final rule on the 1999 amendments to Part 1614, the Commission explained its compromise resolution at 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648-49 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission proposed several changes to the hearings provisions in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the most significant being the proposal to make administrative judge's decisions final in complaints referred to them for hearing. The Commission received dozens of comments on this proposal, with the majority of agency commenters opposing it and the non-agency commenters overwhelmingly favoring it. A number of agencies challenged EEOC's statutory authority to make administrative judges' decisions final, arguing that section 717(c) of Title VII requires that agencies take final action on EEO complaints before a complainant may appeal to EEOC. In addition, an agency argued that agency final action is required to trigger federal court suit rights. Section 717(c) permits an individual to file a lawsuit in federal court in four instances, including within 90 days of receipt of notice of final action. One agency suggested that EEOC could make administrative judges' decisions final by moving the hearing process to the appellate stage. Agencies also expressed concern about EEOC's resources, believing that there will be an increase in requests for hearings if administrative judges' decisions are made final. Agencies also questioned the quality and consistency of administrative judges' decisions in opposing the change. Several agencies complained that they would be unable to defend themselves if administrative judges' decisions were made final.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several agencies, however, supported the proposal. One noted that EEOC's statistics demonstrate a problem with the EEO process government-wide that undermines the confidence of complainants in the system and creates a perception of unfairness. The civil rights groups, unions and attorneys' groups that commented on the proposal strongly supported it and some noted that it is the most important change proposed by EEOC in the NPRM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has carefully considered all of the comments on this issue. The Commission strongly believes that allowing agencies to reject or modify an administrative judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law and to substitute their own decision leads to an unavoidable conflict of interest and creates a perception of unfairness in the federal EEO system. While the Commission believes that its interpretation of the statute regarding the Commission's authority is correct, the Commission has decided to revise the proposal in order to make needed improvements in the procedures while recognizing the concerns expressed by the agencies. At the same time the Commission will preserve the functional goal of the earlier proposal: agencies will no longer be able to simply substitute their view of a case for that of an independent decision-maker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to comments from agencies that the Office of Federal Operations was upholding agency decisions that reversed administrative judge's decisions finding discrimination, we made two independent inquiries of EEOC's information systems. The Commission had not previously studied that information or reported it, although it had collected it. The first inquiry showed that in 1994 and 1996, there were 80 administrative judges' decisions favorable to complainants that were reversed by the agency, appealed to the Office of Federal Operations, and for which the Office of Federal Operations issued a decision on the merits. Of those 80 decisions, EEOC upheld the administrative judge in 53 instances and upheld the agency in 27 instances. In the second inquiry, we found that in fiscal year 1998, there were 157 decisions by the Office of Federal Operations reviewing administrative judges' decisions adverse to agencies. Of those decisions, 135 (86%) affirmed the administrative judge in whole, 8 (5%) reversed in whole or in part, and 14 (9%) modified the administrative judge's decision. These inquiries demonstrated that the arguments made by the agencies were not supported by the facts. EEOC upholds administrative judges' decisions in a significant majority of all cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final rule provides that administrative judges will issue decisions on all complaints referred to them for hearings. Agencies will have the opportunity to take final action on the complaint by issuing a final order within 40 days of receipt of the hearing file and the administrative judge's decision. The final order will notify the complainant whether or not the agency will fully implement the decision of the administrative judge and will contain notice of the complainant's suit and appeal rights. If the agency's final order does not fully implement the decision of the administrative judge, the agency must simultaneously file an appeal of the decision with EEOC. In this way, agencies will take final action on complaints referred to administrative judges by issuing a final order, but they will not introduce new evidence or write a new decision in the case. Agencies will have an additional 20 days to file a brief in support of their appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies should take note of the closing comments of the Commission. In cases where a decision is issued by an administrative judge, the agency is restricted to taking final action by indicating whether or not it will implement that decision. No new evidence may be introduced by the agency at this <span id="Page_550"></span>stage. Similarly, the agency may not engage in its own factfinding in taking final action. In declining to fully implement the decision of an administrative judge, no rationale on the part of the agency is required. The rationale should be presented in the agency's brief on appeal. As discussed fully in <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec8-1">Chapter 8</a>, agencies should also be aware that the appellate standards of OFO have been changed. The burden on appeal is placed squarely on the agency and the Commission will grant substantial deference to the factual findings of its administrative judges.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1999 regulation amendments in no way alter the agency's role in issuing a final decision where a hearing is not requested, or in those cases where a complaint is dismissed in its entirety under 29 CFR 1614.107(a). The case law prior to November 9, 1999 for final agency decisions on the record is not affected. In any event, much of the case law developed under the former regulations will continue to be relevant even in cases where a hearing is held.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec7-2"><span class="space">I.</span> FINAL AGENCY ORDER AFTER HEARING</h2>
<p class="noindent">When the complainant requests a hearing, the administrative judge has four options: 1) to dismiss the hearing request as untimely filed; 2) to dismiss the complaint for any reason set forth in 29 CFR 1614.107(a); 3) to issue a decision without a hearing subject to 29 CFR 1614.109(g) after making a determination that there are no material facts in dispute; or 4) to issue a decision after taking evidence at a hearing. In the first situation where the hearing request is dismissed as untimely, the agency must issue a final agency decision in the case based on the existing complaint file. An untimely hearing request is treated as if the complainant either made no request for a hearing or, in the alternative, requested a final agency decision on the record. Discussed in this section are the latter three situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 29 CFR 1614.109(b), administrative judge can dismiss a complaint for the same reasons that an agency can dismiss a complaint under 1614.107(a). Under 29 CFR 1614.109(g), the administrative judge can issue a decision on the merits of a complaint if he or she determines that there are no material facts in dispute. Finally, if neither subsection (b) nor (g) applies, the administrative judge must issue a decision on the merits of the complaint after holding a hearing on the matter. In each of these situations, the complaint, along with the judge's final order in the cases, is returned to the agency which must, within 40 days of receipt, issue a notice advising the complainant whether it will fully implement the decision of the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="noindent">Pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.110(a):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Final action by an agency following a decision by an administrative judge</span>. When an administrative judge has issued a decision under 1614.109(b), (g) or (i), the agency shall take final action on the complaint by issuing a final order within 40 days of receipt of the hearing file and the administrative judge's decision. The final order shall notify the complainant whether or not the agency will fully implement the decision of the administrative judge and shall contain notice of the complainant's right to appeal to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the right to file a civil action in federal district court, the name of the proper defendant in any such lawsuit and the applicable time limits for appeals and lawsuits. If the final order does not fully implement the decision of the administrative judge, then the agency shall simultaneously file an appeal in accordance with &#x00A7; 1614.403 and append a copy of the appeal to the final order. A copy of EEOC Form 573 shall be attached to the final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">This provision applies to any final decision of an administrative judge, whether the decision is a dismissal, a decision without a hearing, or a decision on the merits following a hearing. MD-110, at 5-32, defines "fully implement" as meaning that the "agency adopts without modification the decision of the Administrative Judge." The provision does not apply to orders issued by the administrative judge in the course of processing a case, that do not dispose of the case. Such orders are not immediately appealable by either the complainant or the agency and can be challenged only after the judge issues a final decision.
