<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-17"><span class="space">8.</span> Good Faith Accommodation Efforts</h4>
<p class="noindent">Prior to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, an agency's good faith efforts to accommodate a qualified employee with a disability did not shield it from liability under the Rehabilitation Act when its efforts fell short of what is required by law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re the Commission</span>, 05880098 (1989) (reassignment to another position is discriminatory where a complainant can perform the duties of his position without accommodation). The 1991 Civil Rights Act now provides for a partial good faith defense.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section 102 of the Act, codified at 42 USC 1981a(a)(3), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AND GOOD FAITH EFFORT.--In cases where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation pursuant to section 102(b)(5) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or regulations implementing section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, damages may not be awarded under this section where the covered entity demonstrates good faith efforts, in consultation with the person with the disability who has informed the covered entity that accommodation is needed, to identify and make a reasonable accommodation that would provide such individual with an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The damages referred to later in the section are compensatory damages for such things as pain, suffering, embarrassment, humiliation and out-of-pocket costs. The defense does not insulate the agency from traditional "make whole" remedies, such as reinstatement with back pay and benefits nor does it relieve the agency of its obligation to provide reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Act makes no attempt to define the term "good faith," but does, at a minimum, require consultation with the employee regarding accommodation. However, the good faith of an agency's efforts is likely to be determined, in part, by whether the agency complied with the Commission's guidance in the area of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has now decided several cases involving the good faith standard. Because the issue relates primarily to relief, these cases are discussed in Chapter 21 in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-30-008.html#sec21-9">Compensatory Damages</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, however, the Commission made clear that good faith efforts at accommodation, when they fall short, do not exonerate the agency from its obligation to provide reasonable accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Raspanti v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01942756 (1997), the Commission found that the agency discriminated against the complainant based on her disability when it did not adequately respond to her requested accommodations. In that case, the complainant suffered from a neck disability as a result of an auto accident that limited her ability to move her head without pain. The complainant, a GS-4 clerk-typist who was still serving her probationary period, requested accommodations when it became clear that the addition of new staff would increase the amount of her typing duties. Previously, the typing duties comprised only 15% of the complainant's duties. She requested a computer and some minor work station modifications.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding that the modifications were never made and that the complainant was terminated before the newly-ordered computer arrived, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Raspanti</span>, found the agency had not engaged in a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant, but instead rushed to fire her before the end of her probationary period. In a footnote, however, "the Commission observe[d] that our regulatory authority does not permit the agency to satisfy its obligations merely through 'good faith efforts' at accommodation, but instead unequivocally requires that '[a]n agency shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an applicant or employee who is [a] qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of its program.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Darius C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120160004 (2016), the agency failed to accommodate the hearing-impaired complainant when it held a service meeting and failed to provide a sign language interpreter. The complainant requested an interpreter, and his supervisor assured him that the same meeting would be held again the next day with an interpreter. No such meeting was held. Before the Commission, the complainant's first and second line supervisors testified that an interpreter was secured for a second meeting, but the interpreter did not show up. The agency made no further attempts to reschedule. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Darius C</span>., had little trouble finding that the <span id="Page_1275"></span>agency's one-time effort failed to cure its initial failure to accommodate and fell short of good faith:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency's tepid assurance to Complainant that a second service talk on October 12, 2014, would have an interpreter available was not backed by any action. The Agency asserts that it made the effort to secure interpreter services, despite the non-appearance on an interpreter. We find that under the circumstance of this case, the Agency's actions provided mere "lip service" to Complainant's clear request for reasonable accommodation, and the Agency has not demonstrated it made good faith efforts to comply with that request.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the case did not specifically deal with the good faith defense, in <span class="Italic">Hupka v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 02960003 (1997), the Commission gave some additional insight into its view of good faith accommodation efforts. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Hupka</span>, the Commission indicated that a good faith accommodation effort is a two-way street; an effort that should be "interactive." Relying on <span class="Italic">Beck v. Univ. of Wisconsin Board of Regents</span>, 75 F.3d 1130 (7th Cir. 1996), the Commission found that such "interactive" efforts can require an ongoing dialogue. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hupka</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts herein indicate that appellant advised the agency that he had been diagnosed with CFIDS and that he needed various accommodations for his condition. The agency agreed to provide him with some of his requested accommodations upon receipt of letters from Physician A attesting to his condition. It further declined, however, to provide the additional accommodation of working at home or at an alternative work site absent more specific information, which appellant initially did not provide. At this point, the interactive process broke down. The agency, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Beck v. Univ. of Wisconsin Bd. of Regents</span>, 75 F.3d 1130 (7th Cir. 1996), contends that appellant is responsible for the breakdown and that it thus cannot be found liable for failing to provide appellant with the requested accommodations. In Beck, the court stated that "courts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary. A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1135.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant initially refused to provide the agency with appropriate information concerning his medical condition. That is, the agency properly requested information from appellant's health care providers concerning the diagnosis of CFIDS, appellant's prognosis, and his request for accommodation. Appellant's initial response in February 1994--a refusal to provide any personal information and the submission of a cursory statement from Physician A and copies of pages from a book on CFS--was wholly inadequate. Thereafter, however, in response to subsequent agency requests for information, appellant submitted the June 22, 1994 letter from Physician A, in which Physician A provided more detail concerning the bases of his diagnosis and prognosis and included a recommendation concerning appellant's request for an accommodation relative to the issue of commuting to work. The Commission finds that the June 22 letter provided the agency with enough information from which it should have provided appellant with the accommodations recommended therein, identified other accommodations that would have accomplished the same results, or denied the request based on undue hardship--a contention that the agency never raised. Moreover, we note that the agency has allowed other employees to work at home as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so ruling, we reject the agency's argument that the June 22 letter was inadequate and that it needed additional information before it could grant appellant's request. Physician A's June 22 letter responded directly to questions the agency previously posed: it provided information concerning appellant's diagnosis and prognosis and further advised the agency that appellant could perform the duties of his job for a full eight hours if he did not have to commute the forty-five minutes each way to and from work. Moreover, the agency's response to Physician A's June 22 letter, Memorandum 1, sought information beyond that which would have been necessary, in the absence of the June 22 letter, to determine appellant's entitlement to a work site accommodation. First, Letter 2, which the agency attached to Memorandum 1, sought "copies of all [of appellant's] medical records and tests.... (Emphasis added.) Appellant requested an accommodation because of CFIDS; Letter 2 improperly sought information unrelated to this condition. Second, Letter 2 included several questions focused on whether appellant could work an eight-hour day if he had to commute to and from the work site. Physician A's June 22 letter already had advised the agency that appellant could not. Finally, Letter 2 asked Physician A to suggest other accommodations. In his June 22 letter, Physician A identified an accommodation that he determined would enable appellant to perform the essential functions of his job as well as work an eight-hour day: let appellant work at home. As noted above, the process of identifying a reasonable accommodation is intended to be interactive; here, however, the agency has placed the entire burden of suggesting possible accommodations on appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the agency failed to show undue hardship and failed to offer appellant a reasonable accommodation, the Commission finds that appellant met his burden of establishing discrimination on the basis of disability and that the agency's final grievance decision improperly found to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Burchfield v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01970152 (2000), the Commission held that the agency demonstrated bad faith where, in advance of a training session, it contacted the facility where the training was to be held and found it did not have accessible bathrooms. However, the agency failed to inform the complainant of that fact prior to the training. The agency's request for reconsideration was denied. <span class="Italic">Burchfield v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05A10354 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">At least minor discipline does not preclude an agency from showing it made good faith efforts to reasonably accommodate a complainant. In <span class="Italic">Schauer v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01970854 (2001), the agency issued a letter of reprimand to the complainant for unscheduled absences and failing to follow proper reporting procedures for absences. The complainant suffered from a multiple personality disorder that left her confused when shifting between personalities. Often, she would forget what she had been doing and was unaware of how she had gotten where she was. Although the Commission in <span class="Italic">Schauer</span> found the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant's disability, it did find that the agency engaged in good faith efforts to provide accommodation, even where it issued a letter of reprimand:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that the record supports the AJ's finding of disability discrimination in this matter. As we discern no legal basis to disturb the AJ's recommended decision, the Commission adopts the AJ's recommended decision that the agency failed in its affirmative duty to accommodate complainant's disability. As a final note, we acknowledge, as did the AJ, that the agency made a good faith effort to provide complainant with reasonable accommodations for her disability. Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), compensatory damages may be awarded for pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. However, Section 102 of the CRA also provides that an agency is not liable for compensatory damages in cases of disability discrimination where it demonstrates that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant's disability. A good faith effort can be demonstrated by proof that the agency, in consultation with the disabled individual, attempted to identify and make a reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. Compare Luellen v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951340 (December 23, 1996) (agency demonstrated good faith effort where it consulted with complainant and her physicians in attempting to identify a reasonable accommodation, despite the fact that these efforts were not sufficient to afford complainant a reasonable accommodation) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Morris v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01962984 (October 1, 1998) (agency did not make a good faith effort to identify and provide a reasonable accommodation for complainant where it did not make any attempt to find an available office position for complainant in spite of his repeated requests.) In the case at hand, the agency consulted with complainant and designed various accommodations such as work schedule changes and allowing any one of her alter personalities to call in to request annual leave. We find that the agency's efforts, although not sufficient to afford a reasonable accommodation, demonstrate that the agency made a good faith effort to accommodate complainant. Consequently, complainant is not entitled to receive compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Conner v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996212 (2002), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that it engaged in good faith accommodation efforts where its interim accommodation to make a restroom accessible to a paraplegic was implemented only after he complained several times and was only marGINAlly effective and the permanent accommodation took more than a year:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency thus argues that even if it failed to reasonably accommodate complainant, it nevertheless showed good faith to do so, and therefore that no compensatory damages were warranted. Thus, according to the agency, its Flexiplace arrangement, as well as the interim solution, involving the hook and chain, and the other measures taken and/or explored to achieve permanent independent access show absolute good faith by the agency. In its view the Flexiplace agreement in fact assured avoidance of adverse health consequences and such agreement alone should rise to level of good faith. In the agency's view, the use of the hook and chain to hold the door also plainly evidences its good faith efforts, as do the other steps it had taken and/or explored.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence of record does not substantiate a finding of good faith. As previously indicated, the Flexiplace arrangement is irrelevant to complainant's needs when at the office, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> Building 5A. The hook and chain solution took several months to implement, and it is undetermined whether it was installed due to the agency's sensitivity to the complainant's need for access to the men's restroom, or whether it was due to complainant's independent efforts. The record suggests that complainant contacted his Supervisor and the Disability Coordinator on numerous occasions during the period May 1995 to May 1996 about the inaccessibility of the men's restroom. The Disability Coordinator testified <span id="Page_1276"></span>that complainant "complained many times" that he needed something else done to the door. I.R. at 60. The Disability Coordinator further indicated that he would check with Public Works, and that he believed Public Works "just sat" on the matter<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The Disability Coordinator further indicated that Public Works eventually came in and took the door off completely and extended the privacy wall so that people walking by could not look in<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Significantly, the Disability Coordinator stated that this was pursuant to a work order which they had for over a year<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Complainant's Supervisor acknowledged that complainant came to her office on two or three occasions, before the installation of the hook and chain, to complain that he was having difficulty with the men's room door<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 53. She further acknowledged that she came to realize that the hook and chain assembly was not working as well as it should be because complainant returned to see her<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Subsequently, complainant also came to <span class="Italic">see</span> her about possibly using an electronic door opener<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 53-54. Sometime thereafter, complainant also informed her that the matter still had not been satisfactorily addressed<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 54. According to the agency, it took approximately a week to 10 days from the January 1997 meeting for the door of the men's room to be permanently removed and a privacy wall extended. Agency's Reply to Appeal at 10. In sum, given the complainant's undisputed need for effective access to the men's restroom, the numerous times complainant complained about the inaccessibility of the men's restroom over the period of a year, the agency's failure to effectively address complainant's request for accommodation for over one year, the agency's failure to satisfactorily explain its failure to reasonably accommodate complainant in a more timely manner, and the testimony of the Disability Coordinator suggesting that the agency "just sat" on the matter, we conclude that the agency has failed to demonstrate a "good faith" effort to reasonably accommodate complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same good faith requirement can, however, form the basis for dismissal of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Waterstrat v. General Services Administration</span>, 03970076 (1997) (dismissal was warranted where the complainant refuses to provide any information regarding his alleged disability); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Megine v. Runyon</span>, 114 F.3d 415 (3rd Cir. 1997). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Faconti v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976463 (1999), the Commission held, in a case decided on the merits, that the complainant's failure to provide the agency with information on the specific accommodation he sought relieved the agency of liability for any failure to accommodate. It is important to note in the <span class="Italic">Faconti</span> case that the agency made several efforts to accommodate the complainant and several attempts to get more specific information on the needed accommodation. As a result, the Commission found that the agency engaged in a good faith, reasonable effort to provide reasonable accommodation. The complainant's failure to provide specific information may not act as a bar to liability where the agency has not made significant efforts to obtain the information and provide accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">It would seem that a good faith effort requires that the agency provide an accommodation that it later discovers is not effective. In <span class="Italic">Fowler v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A60440 (2006), the Commission found there was not a good faith effort at accommodation where the complainant's job assignment was outside of her medical restrictions. In holding that the agency was liable, the Commission noted that "our focus is on the knowledge that was available to the agency before it offered the position to complainant. This was not a situation where an agency provided accommodation and later discovered that it was not effective. Here, the agency knew or should have known that its job offer was not within complainant's medical restrictions when the offer was made." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120061020 (2008), the Commission found that the agency had engaged in a good faith accommodation effort that simply fell short of what was legally required. In <span class="Italic">Jimenez</span>, the complainant suffered brain damage as the result of an auto accident. The agency made several accommodations including allowing the complainant to work at home as much as two days a week. However, the complainant continued to be bothered at work by distractions for coworker noise and overhead lighting. The agency removed the lights over the complainant's desk and allowed him to use a storage room to work in, though he did not have exclusive use of the room as it was also occasionally used by other employees. The agency did, ultimately, provide the complainant with a private office. The entire process took nearly 18 months, but the Commission also found that some of the delay was brought about by conflicting information provided by the complainant's physicians and their delay in providing other information. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jimenez</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Commission concurs with the AJ's finding that the agency acted in good faith to provide complainant with reasonable accommodations to address his known disabilities under the circumstances. Specifically, we consider, as did the AJ, that the agency acted reasonably when faced with conflicting medical documentation concerning the nature and extent of complainant's injuries and his need for accommodations in February and March 2003. While subsequent documentation from complainant's neurologist specifically deferred to the recommendations of complainant's psychologist and other healthcare providers, we find the agency properly questioned the need for any accommodation, as well as the appropriate accommodation until further clarification was obtained. We do not find, as complainant argues, that the steps taken from March 2003 through October 2003, including unscrewing the bulbs above complainant's workstation, supplying complainant with a glare reducing LCD screen, headphones, and even the baseball hat supplied by complainant's co-worker (to block light) were laughable or even obviously ineffective. Though later found to be inadequate, they may well have been effective and, under the circumstances, were not unreasonable steps in the accommodation process. We further note that when complainant informed the agency that his healthcare provider would conduct an onsite review of his work environment, the agency reasonably waited for this inspection to occur, though ultimately, it never did. We find no reason to disturb the AJ's finding that the agency acted in good faith to provide complainant with an effective accommodation and we therefore find that the AJ's denial of complainant's request for compensatory damages was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that the agency had made a good faith effort at accommodation in <span class="Italic">Guilbeaux v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720050094 (2008), where the agency initially denied the complainant's request for light duty but, over a two month period, continued to explore possible light duty assignments and ultimately gave the complainant a light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Eleni M. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020001903 (2021), did not establish a good faith effort to provide reasonable accommodations where it terminated the interactive process while the complainant was on leave:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission previously found that an agency lacked good faith when responding to a reasonable accommodation request where the agency used the complainant's leave status as an excuse to halt the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See Denese G. v. Dep't of the Treas</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016). Another indication of a lack of "good faith" effort occurs where an Agency's inaction in response to a request for a reasonable accommodation, forces a complainant to take leave for a significant period time, which they would not have had to do if the Agency made a reasonable accommodation available to them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record does not reflect that the Agency acted in good faith when responding to Complainant's requests for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation. S1 made efforts to engage in the interactive process for both of Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests, including following up and arranging a meeting with the RA Manager. She also partially granted Complainant's November 21, 2016 request by providing him with a laptop in order to telework as a reasonable accommodation. Yet, there is no evidence that S1 made any meaningful attempt to secure a reasonable accommodation for Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lack of good faith is evinced by S1's improper disability-related inquiries including her <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act, and, in particular, S1's refusal to proceed with Complainant's second request unless Complainant provided her with a completed AR 690-12 Appendix C. Under the circumstances, it was not necessary for Complainant to submit this particular document, and it should not have been a barrier to Complainant obtaining a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant already submitted a reasonable accommodation request and provided S1 with ample up to date supporting medical documentation confirming her need for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation, specifically, Dragon Software upon her return to work. The AR 690-12 Appendix C is a list of questions to be used as a tool for engaging in the interactive process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency explains that it requires this document in accordance with its internal policies, failure to complete a form is not necessarily a valid reason to delay providing a reasonable accommodation. In her testimony, S1 appears to conflate the AR 690-12 Appendix C with the interactive process itself. Similarly, a December 2016 email to S1, around the time of her surgery, Complainant indicates that she had not completed her CAP form. Complainant's November 21, 2016 request and accompanying documentation identified all of the necessary information, including the specific assistive technology Complainant sought. The form is also not required under Agency policy. AR 690-12, Appendix D states that in order to obtain an assistive technology through CAP, an employee must "confirm request in writing, preferably by completing the CAP Request Form." (Emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not shown the Agency to be liable for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to the extent that she alleges that on or about July 14, 2018, S1 failed to notify her that her assistive technology arrived from CAP. Complainant reasons that S1 knew that she took FMLA leave because typing without an accommodation harmed her fingers and wrist. S1 was also aware that with assistive technology, Complainant and could have worked with minimal use of her right hand and wrist had she been allowed to return from FMLA. Complainant argues that her August requests to come into work were denied for similar reasons. However, Complainant was on notice that her assistive technology was scheduled to be delivered from CAP around this time, she received emails informing her when it was shipped and when it was delivered, and she did not notify S1. Regardless, Complainant has not shown that <span id="Page_1277"></span>S1 would have known to contact her while she was on leave because it was not clear whether Complainant still needed to stay on FMLA leave to care for her mother, whose condition worsened in recent months. Further, Complainant did not call or email her office to inquire whether the assistive technology arrived or ask about it when she contacted the Agency in August 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that an unnecessary delay in providing an effective reasonable accommodation can indicate bad faith and result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. EEOC Guidance No. 915.002 at Q. 10, <span class="Italic">Yessenia H. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070027 (Oct. 13, 2015). In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for the delay; (2) the length of the delay; (3) how much the individual with a disability and the agency each contributed to the delay; (4) what the agency was doing during the delay; and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency created several months-long unnecessary delays, beginning on November 30, 2016, when S1 first notified Complainant that she would not act on his accommodation request until Complainant returned to work with updated medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The delay was unnecessary because Complainant already provided sufficient documentation to support her request. Regardless, Complainant submitted the December 7, 2016 medical documentation and demonstrated a continued effort to obtain more (unnecessary) documentation for S1. The unnecessary delay prevented Complainant from efficiently teleworking, despite S1 promptly providing her with a laptop. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Patricia W. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172637 (Mar. 26, 2019) (agency caused an unnecessary delay where the complainant was provided a reasonable accommodation of full time telework, but it took four months to provide the necessary technical equipment, software, and training). With the exception of December 19 and 20, 2016, S1, after consulting the RA Manager decided to take no further action until Complainant returned to work, with updated medical documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 reasoned that that after surgery and intensive occupational therapy, Complainant may no longer need a reasonable accommodation when she returned. <span class="Italic">See Clayton C. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120120350 (Nov. 17, 2015) (finding that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process, and rejecting agency's explanation that the complainant's initial request for a reasonable accommodation "expired," given that the complainant's disability was obvious and there was no evidence that the need for the accommodation had been eliminated). S1's reasoning ignores that Complainant's requests for an accommodation were also intended so that she could telework during her recovery (i.e. prior to returning to work). S1 does not acknowledge that the December 7, 2016 physician's note Complainant provided addresses this uncertainty by providing a timeline of her recovery that indicated Complainant would require assistive technology through March 31, 2017. As previously discussed, the record contradicts S1's alternate reason that Complainant withdrew her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 prolonged the unnecessary delay, even when Complainant's February 23, 2017 documentation confirmed that she still had the same limitation, her condition was chronic (so her initial accommodation request from November 21, 2016 was still valid), and she required Dragon Software as a reasonable accommodation. without a reasonable accommodation. By this point, it was definitely foreseeable that the unnecessary delay in obtaining assistive technology would result in Complainant missing work due to flareups of her condition arising from efforts to work without an accommodation. S1 continued not to act despite receiving Complainant's March 20, and 27, 2016 medical documents and upon Complainant's March 20, 2016 return to the office with an obvious disability. S1 attributed her delay in providing Complainant with a reasonable accommodation to Complainant's failure to fully respond to (improper) disability-related inquiries, and insisting that no further action could be taken until Complainant engaged in the interactive process by completing an AR 690-12 Appendix C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant and the Agency both contributed to the delay in providing reasonable accommodations, however the Agency did so to a much greater extent and to the detriment of its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Ruben T. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120171405 (Mar. 22, 2019) (in determining that the agency was responsible for the unnecessary delay in providing the complainant a reasonable accommodation, the Commission considered that complainant was proactive, and the agency ceased its efforts to provide an accommodation when he was temporarily placed on another assignment, and there was "nothing in the record showing that he withdrew or paused his request for the additional software"). Complainant could have been clearer in her December 6, 2016 response email to S1, who interpreted it as a withdrawal of her complaint. However, as previously discussed, S1 should not have ceased her efforts to obtain a reasonable accommodation for Complainant before or after Complainant's email, given the December 7, 2016 medical documents. The record supports that S1 reached out to Complainant multiple times in March, April and May 2017 to obtain the completed AR 690-12 Appendix C. While it is not clear why Complainant failed to provide this document, it is not a sufficient reason to withhold a reasonable accommodation, given that she already provided a reasonable accommodation request and supporting medical documents. S1 also had opportunities to complete the document together with Complainant when they met to discuss accommodations. CAP appears to have been responsive when Complainant contacted them independently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The assistive technology Complainant requested as a reasonable accommodation was simple to provide because it was available through CAP. According to Section 1.3 of the Agency's "Procedures for Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities" the Agency's purpose in establishing CAP was to make assistive technology available to employees that needed it, and not cost individual offices or departments (contrary to S1's assertion). In both verbal and written communications to S1, including the November 21, 2016 reasonable accommodation request, Complainant provided the specific items of assistive technology she believed would make an effective reasonable accommodation. S1 needed only to submit a request through CAP. Appendix D-2 of AR 690-12 provides clear information about how to request assistive technology through CAP, and CAP is identified as a resource in other portions of AR-690-12. That Complainant could obtain the assistive technology independently underscores how obtaining her reasonable accommodation was not a complex process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude the Agency's excessive delay in responding to Complainant's request for reasonable accommodation was in bad faith, entitling her to consideration of an award for compensatory damages.</p>
