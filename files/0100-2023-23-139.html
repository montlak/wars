<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-137"><span class="space">b.</span> Fitness-For-Duty Examinations Not Permissible</h5>
<p class="noindent">A "generalized statement that individuals...may be at risk is certainly not the type of specific, individualized objective evidence that allows the Agency to conclude that Complainant was unable to perform the essential functions <span id="Page_1235"></span>of his position, as the Rehabilitation Act requires." <span class="Italic">Salvatore K. v. U.S. Marshals Service</span>, 0120182095 (2021). In <span class="Italic">Salvatore K</span>., the Commission found a violation of the Rehabilitation Act where the complainant disclosed that he was pre-diabetic and the agency required 11 types of medical information and examinations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, employers may make disability-related inquires or require medical examinations of employees only if they are job related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c). The Rehabilitation Act does not limit the prohibitions against improper medical inquiries to individuals with disabilities. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c); <span class="Italic">Meeker v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A12137 (Aug. 23, 2002). Moreover, generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee may be 'job related and consistent with business necessity' when an employer "has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the ADA</span> (July 27, 2000) (Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Examinations) at Question 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Objective evidence" is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party, that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will interfere with his ability to perform essential functions or will result in a direct threat. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Question 7. "Direct threat" means a significant risk of substantial harm that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">Candi R. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120172238 (Feb. 28, 2019).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"An employer is entitled only to the information necessary to determine whether the employee can do the essential functions of the job or work without posing a direct threat." Enforcement Guidance on Employee Inquiries and Examinations at Question 13. The burden is on the Agency to show that one of the criteria justifying the inquiry or examination was met. <span class="Italic">Hampton v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (July 31, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The direct threat evaluation must be based on an individualized assessment of the person's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">Alonzo N. v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120180739 (June 21, 2019). In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include: 1) the duration of the risk; 2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; 3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and 4) the imminence of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Candi R. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120172238.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we note that Complainant is not challenging the Agency's annual medical examination of all CSOs. He is only challenging the Agency's subsequent medical inquiries/examinations. After the annual medical examination, the Agency initially asked Complainant to provide it with at least ten different types of medical information and examinations, including one month of glucose values performed at least four times per day; cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and ocular tests, including a treadmill stress test; current hemoglobin measures; the number of hypoglycemic events in the previous years, and the number of such events that required assistance from others; a copy of all laboratory results taken over the previous year; a copy of all outpatient clinic notes taken over the previous year; the date of onset/diagnosis, history of Ketoacidosis, hospitalizations, and general statement of Complainant's compliance with diabetic education, prescribed medications, dietary recommendations, and activity recommendations over the past year; orthostatic blood pressure measurements while in the supine position and three minutes after Complainant stands up; and Complainant's current eye examination by an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After Complainant responded to the Agency's initial medical inquiry, the Agency subsequently requested that he provide at least eleven types of medical information and examinations, including an eye doctor's report and a "maximal, stress treadmill exercise test"; a report setting forth the date of the onset of Complainant's diabetes; Complainant's history of ketoacidosis and hospitalizations; Complainant's compliance with treatment; a report on whether Complainant had neurological or renal diabetic complications; Complainant's "clinical course over the past 2 years"; a copy of "all labs" taken over the previous two years, including current C-peptide level and current Hemoglobin A1C; a copy of all outpatient clinic records over the past two years; Complainant's orthostatic blood pressure measurements while in the supine position and three minutes after standing up; Complainant's current complete eye exam by an eye doctor documenting the presence or absence of eye disease; and an assessment of the presence of cardiovascular, neurological, and renal disease.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we note that the Agency's medical inquiry was precipitated by Complainant's disclosure that he was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus or Borderline Diabetes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, a Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis does not automatically mean an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of a CSO position, which mostly consists of guarding fixed posts and screening entrants at courthouses. Therefore, the Agency must provide objective evidence that Complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of his position. This standard requires an individualized assessment based on observations about Complainant's work performance or conduct, not generalized conclusions, stereotypes, or perceptions about persons with Diabetes Mellitus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency relies upon ACOEM's guidance to justify Complainant's medical inquiries/examinations. We note that ACOEM guidance states that "diabetes mellitus may place LEO's [law enforcement officers] at risk for sudden incapacitation, thus jeopardizing their ability to perform critical job functions." ROI, Exhibit 18, p. 3. The guidance recommends that individual assessments of law enforcement officers with Diabetes Mellitus should be conducted to determine the employee's history of blood glucose control; knowledge of diabetes and its management; current stability of blood glucose; risk for significant hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; and presence of diabetic complications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, by stating that law enforcement personnel with Diabetes Mellitus should be automatically subjected to medical inquiries/examinations, ACOEM's guidance relies on the type of generalized stereotypes forbidden by the Rehabilitation Act and contradicts the Rehabilitation Act's requirement that medical inquiries/examinations can only be based on individualized assessments/evidence of employees' inability to perform the essential functions of their position. As explained above, we reject the proposition that a mere diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus automatically means that an agency has a job-related, business-necessity based reason for subjecting CSOs to medical inquiries. ACOEM's assertion that persons with Diabetes Mellitus may be at risk for sudden incapacitation that may jeopardize their ability to perform duties is not supported by any data or evidence showing to what extent all individuals with Diabetes Mellitus are prone to such episodes; how often they occur; and to what extent the risk can be reduced or eliminated through medical treatment and lifestyle. A generalized statement that individuals with Diabetes Mellitus "may be at risk" is certainly not the type of specific, individualized objective evidence that allows the Agency to conclude that Complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of his position, as the Rehabilitation Act requires. As such, ACOEM's guidance does not override the requirements and standards of the Rehabilitation Act and, in fact, conflicts with them. Therefore, the Agency's medical inquiries/examinations of Complainant cannot be justified by ACOEM guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, we find that there is simply no evidence that Complainant experienced or displayed any difficulty performing the essential job functions of his CSO position because of his medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Milford R. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120081 (Dec. 3, 2015). Instead, it is undisputed that, after Complainant was diagnosed with Diabetes, ABC's physician informed the Agency that Complainant was medically qualified for his CSO position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, after the Agency subjected Complainant to the initial medical inquiry, his physician also reported that Complainant's medical condition should not impair his ability to perform his job; he had no diabetic symptoms; displayed no evidence of diabetic eye or cardiac disorders; and required no medication. We find that the Agency has not presented any evidence from which it can be reasonably concluded that it possessed objective evidence that Complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The other avenue for the Agency to prove that its medical inquiries/examinations were job-related and a business necessity is by showing that Complainant posed a threat to himself or others because of his Diabetes. To prove direct threat, the Agency must show more than that a person stands some elevated risk of future injury. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo N. v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120180739 (June 21, 2019). Rather, a person is a "direct threat" if he poses a "significant risk of substantial harm" to the health and safety of himself or others which cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">Candi R. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120172238 (Feb. 28, 2019). The direct threat evaluation must be based on an individualized assessment of the person's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. This assessment must be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The burden is on the Agency to prove direct threat. <span class="Italic">Massingill v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01964890 (July 14, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the mere fact that Complainant has Diabetes does not constitute <span id="Page_1236"></span>evidence that he posed a direct threat. Moreover, there is simply no individualized evidence that Complainant posed a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of himself or others which cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that this case is distinguishable from cases wherein we have found that agencies properly subjected diabetic employees to medical inquiries and examinations when they displayed a medical inability to perform work duties. <span class="Italic">See Head v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A12349 (Sep. 4, 2002) (medical inquiry proper when Complainant with Diabetes Mellitus and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder had an attack of low blood sugar resulting in his nearly fainting and being unable to perform his duties as a window clerk); <span class="Italic">Arroyo v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A21863 (June 16, 2003) (medical examination proper when employee with Diabetes who worked as Immigration Inspector at airport suffered many diabetic attacks at work and was found wandering the airport in an incoherent state). In this case, the Agency has not shown that there was any cause to reasonably believe that Complainant could not perform the essential functions of his position. The Agency's medical inquiry was not prompted by an on-the-job diabetic episode, but rather by a mere diagnosis. <span class="Italic">See Boike v. Akal Security, Inc</span>., Case No. 2:17-cv-10109, 2019 WL 4747735 (E.D. Mich. 2019) (direct threat defense and medical examination analysis require an individualized assessment of the employee's current ability to perform the job and a study of reasonable medical knowledge or evidence).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that the Agency subjected Complainant to medical inquiries/examinations that violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's inquiries/examinations were clearly excessive under the Rehabilitation Act. Under EEOC Guidance, an employer is entitled only to the information necessary to determine whether the employee can perform the essential functions of the job or work without posing a direct threat. Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations, Section B, Question 10 (July 27, 2000). Moreover, in most situations, an employer cannot request an employee's complete medical records, because they are likely to contain information unrelated to whether the employee can perform his/her essential functions or work without posing a direct threat. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, not only did the Agency ask for Complainant to undergo a battery of rigorous testing that included a treadmill exercise stress test and measuring his blood glucose levels four times per day, but it also asked for him to generally disclose his history of hospitalizations and for a copy of "all labs" taken over the previous two years. Additionally, the Agency asked for "all [of Complainant's] outpatient clinic records" over the previous two years, and Complainant's history of all medications, including type and dosage adjustments over the past year. These requests were sweeping, overbroad demands that Complainant disclose a wide array of medical information that is likely not related to his Diabetes Mellitus or ability to perform the essential functions of his position. The Agency failed to narrowly tailor its requests to ensure that its requests did not constitute fishing expeditions into Complainant's medical information and history. As such, we determine that the Agency's requests for medical information and examinations were clearly excessive, and therefore violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">To justify a fitness-for-duty exam, agencies must have "a reasonable belief based on objective evidence" that an employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job because of a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span> EEOC No. 915.002 (July 27, 2000) at 5. Objective evidence must be credible and specific. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Linn A. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120171148 (2020) ("Objective evidence is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party, that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will interfere with his ability to perform essential job functions or will result in a direct threat.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency review of the examination results must also be competent. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Linn A. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120171148 (2020), for example, found that the agency failed to establish that a psychological fitness for duty exam was job-related and consistent with business necessity where the complainant presented evidence that the agency incorrectly scored the Patient Health questionnaire and continued to rely on the results after the complainant pointed out the error.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cerge v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120060363 (2007), the Commission found that a fitness-for-duty examination was not justified where the agency was nonspecific as to its reasons that the complainant was subject to emotional outbursts and "temper tantrums":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, complainant's supervisor stated that because complainant demonstrated "signs of depression" during a meeting and had a "temper tantrum" during a discussion, he was concerned about the safety of the public as well as complainant and recommended that complainant be disarmed and sent for a FFDE. The supervisor did not specify what behavior complainant engaged in that led him to conclude that complainant exhibited "signs of depression" or a "temper tantrum." The supervisor stated that a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) supervisor also reported that complainant had engaged in an "outburst of temper tantrums" and requested that complainant be removed from an FBI Task Force, but again the supervisor did not specify the acts that complainant allegedly engaged in that constituted a temper tantrum. The supervisor also generally stated without elaboration that the FFDE was warranted because complainant had exhibited "very rude, unprofessional, disrespectful behavior and [an] outburst of temper tantrum, and, hostile behavior towards the supervisor." The supervisor stated that the fitness for duty examinations were conducted because management was not medically qualified to make a final judgment on complainant's physical and mental conditions. The supervisor stated that he assigned complainant to the Service Processing Center, pending the results of the medical evaluations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Deputy District Director (DDD) stated that complainant's supervisor reported in July 1999 that complainant had entered his office and "broke into a nervous breakdown." The DDD stated that a Labor Management Relations official instructed him to temporarily reassign complainant and relieve him of his service weapon. The DDD stated that upon receiving the findings of a FFDE that cleared complainant for duty as a Special Agent, he reinstated complainant to his duties as an armed Special Agent in March 2000. Complainant contends that he never exhibited any disrespectful behavior toward his supervisor or engaged in temper tantrums.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains a copy of a January 11, 2000 letter to the physician who conducted the FFDE in which the DDD stated that complainant was sent for the FFDEs because "he had a difference of opinions with co-workers," "demonstrated a [sic] disrespectful conduct towards his immediate supervisors and co-workers by showing outbursts of temper tantrums"; "has been disrespectful to supervisors"; and displayed "emotional instability, by being extremely depressed." The letter further stated that complainant and his wife participated in a telephone conversation with the supervisor on August 9, 1999 in which they were rude, unprofessional, disrespectful, and hostile toward the supervisor. DDD also noted that complainant revealed that he was in a car accident in 1986 that caused him to suffer back spasms, memory loss, and anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this matter, we determine that the agency's justifications for ordering complainant to undergo FFDEs are vague and conclusory and thus fail to meet the agency's burden of demonstrating that its requests were job-related and consistent with business necessity. For instance, complainant's supervisor asserts that complainant was directed to undergo FFDEs because of complainant's "outburst of temper tantrums," "very rude, unprofessional, and disrespectful behavior," "signs of depression," and hostility toward the supervisor. We have held that an FFDE was proper when an agency demonstrated that a complainant developed a phobia about meeting with any management in their offices, refused to verbally communicate, and walked off the job. <span class="Italic">See David Harris v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120050086 (March 6; 2007). However, in this case, the agency stated without elaboration that complainant was disrespectful, engaged in temper tantrums, and exhibited signs of depression but failed to link these statements with the type of specific actions and details as identified by the agency in Harris. We further note that although the DDD stated in an interrogatory that the supervisor told her that complainant had cried on one occasion, we find it significant that the DDD was not a witness to this purported incident, and the supervisor who recommended the FFDE did not include this detail in his investigatory statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the agency's claim that complainant and his wife were rude, hostile and disrespectful to a supervisor during a telephone conversation, we find that while such conduct may warrant discipline, the agency has not provided any details about the conversation that would lead us to conclude that the agency had a reasonable belief that complainant posed a direct threat or could not perform the essential functions of his position. In <span class="Italic">Florenda Whiting v. United States Postal Service</span>, Appeal No. 01A14923 (May 8, 2003), the agency ordered a complainant to undergo a FFDE because, according to the supervisor, complainant "exhibited irrational behavior" when he rudely interrupted, confronted, and refused to obey her during a meeting. The Commission found that the FFDE was improper because while such conduct was disruptive and argumentative, it was insufficient to provide the agency with a reasonable belief that complainant posed a direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, disruptive behavior, standing alone, will generally not be sufficient to justify a fitness-for-duty examination. Even when disruptive behavior is combined with a past history of an emotional problem, this may be insufficient to justify an examination where there has been no other display of symptoms during the time period in question. In <span class="Italic">Whiting v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14923 (2003), the Commission found that the complainant's disruptive behavior during a staff meeting did not justify a fitness-for-duty examination where the complainant suffered from a generalized anxiety disorder in the past, but displayed no present symptoms:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1237"></span>Complainant testified that S1 held a meeting on March 15, 2000 and sympathetically informed the staff that the station manager M1 would be losing his job due to medical problems. Complainant claims that S1 violated postal policy by informing the staff of M1's personal problems. Complainant also argues that S1 was acting inappropriately in his attempts to elicit empathy regarding M1's situation. The record indicates that complainant voiced her disapproval at the meeting. S1 testified that he was rudely interrupted twice by complainant and he asked her to be quiet. However, complainant would not listen to S1. S1 testified that he then instructed complainant to be quiet. According to S1, complainant replied "I can talk if I want to. You can't shut me up." S1 also testified that he then told complainant that he wanted to <span class="Italic">see</span> her in his office with a Union official. According to S1, complainant replied "I am not going anywhere with him or anyone else." According to S1, he then instructed complainant to clock out and go home. Two witnesses at the meeting corroborated S1's testimony regarding the March 15, 2000 meeting, without expressing their opinion. Two witnesses stated that they did not believe that complainant created a disturbance, but that she spoke up and voiced her disapproval, which they believed should be allowed at such meetings. Another witness corroborated S1's testimony that complainant was speaking despite being told to be quiet. However, this witness also stated that other people at the meeting "were talking to the person next to them" and were not asked to stop talking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While there are witnesses who believe that complainant did not cause a disruption and should not have been instructed to clock out, there is no indication that others in the meeting were directly disobeying instructions from their supervisor. Moreover, there is no indication from the witness statements that the individuals who were also talking were talking directly to S1 or that their statements were confrontational as complainant's statements appeared to be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that on March 23, 2000, S1 ordered complainant to undergo a Fitness for Duty Examination (FFDE) because, according to S1, complainant had "exhibited irrational behavior" at a unit safety talk on March 15, 2000 and because complainant has a "history of psychiatric problems and a history of violent acts." There is no elaboration by S1 on complainant's "history of psychiatric problems." Moreover, while the record supports the finding that complainant suffered from some sort of anxiety disorder in the late 1980s, there is no indication from the record that complainant exhibited any specific problems during the time period in question here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the record, we find insufficient evidence to support the finding that S1 had a reasonable belief based upon objective evidence that complainant's ability to perform essential job functions was impaired by any particular medical condition. In addition, we find that complainant's conduct at the March 15, 2000 meeting, while perhaps disruptive, was insufficient in providing S1 with a reasonable belief that complainant posed a direct threat. Accepting as true, S1's account of the meeting, we find that complainant was argumentative and failed to follow a direct order. However, she did not exhibit any threatening conduct toward anyone. Accordingly, we find that the FFDE was improper and a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120061135 (2007), the Commission found that a fitness-for-duty examination was not job-related and consistent with business necessity where the exam was based on observations by the postmaster that the complainant seemed to be suffering from some "sort of illness." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her Affidavit, the Postmaster testified that she often noticed complainant sweating profusely and looking like he was going to pass out on the work floor. She further noted that when asked if he was alright, complainant always stated he was fine. She also stated that prior lo March 22, 2004, complainant had begun to call in sick more than usual, and she submitted leave records to support this claim. She also stated that during a conversation with complainant, he informed her he was diabetic. Complainant denied making such statement, and we note that the Postmaster did not identify the date when this conversation supposedly occurred. The record contains no evidence that complainant has diabetes or ever stated to the Postmaster that he did.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Postmaster stated that in the past, she observed that another employee, who had a leg injury similar to complainants, had his pants leg rolled up and the leg was purple in color. She explained that she requested that the employee undergo an FFD examination and as result, they learned that the employee was diabetic and that he needed to have his leg elevated all the time. She stated that the employee ultimately retired on a medical disability, she specifically stated that what she learned from this incident affected the way she handled complainant and his medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his Affidavit, complainant's supervisor stated that on March 22, 2004, complainant was limping and could not perform all the essential job functions of his position such as climbing ladders, or going up to clean the Look-Out Gallery. The supervisor also stated that complainant could not bend or stoop down and sweated heavily. The supervisor stated that when this occurred he called another custodian from another station to come and complete complainant's duties. The supervisor stated that complainant never asked to switch or transfer, nor did he ask to switch or transfer some of his job functions, and he always got upset when another custodian was called over. The supervisor submitted no documentation in support of his claim that on March 22, 2004 (or any date) complainant was unable to perform any of his job functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for the referral for FFD examination to be lawful under the Rehabilitation Act, management is required to establish that on or around March 22, 2004, there was "objective evidence" that complainant's ability to perform his essential job functions was impaired by a medical condition or that he posed a direct threat due to a medical condition. After a careful review of the record, we find that management has not met this burden. For instance, the Postmaster has made general statements about her observations concerning complainant's appearance and heavy breathing, yet she did not submit any document to substantiate that she had witnessed complainant in this condition. For instance, the Postmaster could have submitted logs or personal notes describing her observations of complainant's appearance/condition at different times, but she failed to do so. The record is also devoid of any evidence that, as the Postmaster stated in her memorandum, "it [was] not safe for him to do his job as a Custodian."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, although complainant's supervisor contends that on March 22, 2004 complainant was unable to climb ladders, complainant denies that this was true, and in fact states that he did stand on a ladder to dust cases and perform other tasks requiring a ladder. The supervisor did not provide any documentation that on that date complainant was not able to perform this function of his job. There is also no evidence that the supervisor called another custodian from another station to come and complete complainant's duties, as the supervisor claims. Nor is there evidence that the supervisor has ever been required to call for assistance because of complainant's inability to do his work. The supervisor did not provide any performance appraisals, disciplinary records or other documentation to support his contention that complainant was failing to perform any of his essential job functions. There is, in fact, nothing in this record (other than management's bare assertions) to refute complainant's statements that on March 22, 2004, he had been working at Laguna Niguel for about 5 years without a complaint or problem with his work, and/or that he had been accident free for approximately 7 years of service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Postmaster specifically admitted that she applied her past experience with another employee to complainant's situation. She stated that because that prior employee turned out to have diabetes, she ordered the FFD for complainant's protection and the protection of the agency. This is persuasive evidence that the decision to order the FFD was not made based on objective evidence concerning complainant, and was instead made based on the Postmaster's assumptions about his condition because of her past experience. Finally, we recognize that as a result of the examination, some restrictions were placed on complainant. However, the FAD specifically states that the restrictions (no climbing ladders, no repetitive bending or stooping) were due to the fact that complainant twisted his knee on March 27, 2004 (five days after the FFD examination was ordered, but before the examination actually occurred on April 7, 2004). Although the record indicates that the twisted knee occurred because complainant did not select the proper size ladder for his weight, there is still no indication that complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. This simply indicates that complainant ought to have used a different size ladder to complete the task at hand. In sum, we find that the evidence contained in this record simply does not support that the FFD examination in question was job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">A fitness-for-duty examination was not warranted where the agency already had a letter from the complainant's psychiatrist stating he was unable to work due to depression. In <span class="Italic">Arnold C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093856 (2015), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we conclude that the FFDE violated the Rehabilitation Act's prohibition against disability-related inquiries which are not "job-related and consistent with business necessity." Specifically, the Area Human Resources Manager testified that he required Complainant to submit to the FFDE because Complainant's depression was not "evident prior to his abrupt absence." ROI, Vol. 1, at 16. Further, the Manager of Diversity and Human Capital testified that "Complainant's inability to report for work after he refused to accept an involuntary reassignment" was a factor in the decision to schedule the FFDE. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 17. The record clearly reflects that the Agency initiated the FFDE because it did not believe Complainant's or his psychiatrist's assertion that Complainant was unable to perform his duties due to his condition. <span class="Italic">See Cofield-Gipson v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073270 (July 9, 2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Bernal v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720080038 (June 17, 2008) (agency <span id="Page_1238"></span>violated the Rehabilitation Act when it requested medical information where it did not believe that complainant's medical condition impaired his ability to perform essential functions of his position)). We note that prior to its request that Complainant submit to the FFDE, the Agency had already received a May 5, 2006, letter from Complainant's psychiatrist. The letter noted that Complainant was unable to carry out his duties due to his major depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has failed to meet its burden of proof. We conclude that the Agency did not demonstrate that the FFDE that Complainant was required to undergo was job-related or consistent with business necessity. Therefore, the Agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">McCulloch v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120111076 (2013) (finding that a fitness-for-duty examination was warranted where the complainant abruptly left staff meetings to vomit, was observed a meetings moving her head back and forth with her eyes wide open, requested a reassignment for medical reasons and wrote that she was having difficulty getting out of bed, difficulty coping and that her supervisor was following her).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the agency's insistence on a fitness-for-duty examination in addition to the ample medical documentation provided by the complainant to support her request for accommodation, amounted to a violation of the Rehabilitation Act in <span class="Italic">Giselle W. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120162671 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the FFDE violated the Rehabilitation Act's prohibition against disability-related inquiries which are not "job-related and consistent with business necessity." We note that prior to its request that Complainant submit to the FFDE, the Agency had already received extensive medical documentation from Complainant, which noted that she could not work in the FCI building and the Warden's Office due to her medical condition. Specifically, we note that Complainant visited a Pulmonologist on March 26, 2012, who diagnosed Complainant with "Occupational Asthma." ROI 2, at 63-64. The Pulmonologist informed Complainant that she developed a hypersensitivity to the carpet in the Warden's area, and classified the FCI as a "sick building" for her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is no dispute that this medical documentation was provided to management officials, including the HRM and the Warden. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 191. Complainant further provided an e-mail dated July 10, 2012, to the Agency that her Pulmonologist recommended that she completely avoid the Warden's area. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 64. We note that based on Complainant's medical documentation, the Agency accommodated Complainant's medical condition with the TAD position and an air purifying system, among other accommodations. In addition, in email to Complainant dated August 8, 2013, the HRM implied that the reason for the FFDE would be to determine if Complainant could return to the Warden's Office without any restrictions. ROI 3, at 108. However, the carpet still remained in the Warden's Office and, as noted above, Complainant had already provided medical documentation explaining her medical situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, the record clearly reflects that the Agency initiated the FFDE because it did not believe Complainant or her Pulmonologist's assertion that Complainant was unable to perform her duties from the Warden's Office due to her condition. <span class="Italic">See Cofield-Gipson v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120073270 (July 9, 2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Bernal v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has failed to meet its burden of proof. We conclude that the Agency did not demonstrate that the FFDE that Complainant was required to undergo was job-related or consistent with business necessity. Therefore, we find that the Agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that the complainant has engaged in behavior that warrants discipline does not in itself justify a fitness-for-duty examination. In <span class="Italic">Snowden v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120083032 (2011), the complainant was subjected to an examination after bumping a coworker in the chest. In finding the exam in <span class="Italic">Snowden</span> was improper, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency stated that it ordered Complainant to undergo a FFDE because she became violent towards another co-worker, and "there were suggestions of other past incidents in the workplace where she became overly aggressive." Specifically, the Agency stated that in a September 11, 2006 incident, Complainant argued with one of the Cath Lab Technicians and pushed her chest into his chest in a manner that the Lab Technician perceived to be threatening. The Agency did not provide any details regarding Complainant's purported previous altercations; therefore, we cannot consider them in our review. As such, we determine that the Agency failed to prove that it ordered the FFDE based upon objective evidence that Complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of her job or posed a direct threat because of a medical condition. While pushing one's chest into a co-worker's chest during an argument may warrant discipline, it is insufficient to provide the Agency with a reasonable belief that she posed a direct threat or could not perform the essential functions of her position. The Agency maintained that Complainant's altercations with co-workers raised concerns about her ability to safely interact with staff, patients, and visitors, but the record does not support this conclusion. Consequently, we find that we find that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it ordered Complainant to undergo a FFDE.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the agency was not justified in ordering a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination based on a report by a mediator that the complainant had engaged in threatening behavior at an EEO mediation. In <span class="Italic">McMurtrey v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120055430 (2007), the Commission found that the mediator had provided no specific information on the alleged threatening behavior. It further found that the human resources manager's vague reference to "traits" the complainant displayed that indicated a resentment of authority did not support the examination, particularly where no action had been taken against the complainant prior to the mediation.</p>
