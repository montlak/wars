<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-47"><span class="space">D.</span> FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROCEDURES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the agency's selection process is flawed will not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, support a finding of discrimination without a showing that the flaw somehow affects a particular protected group. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01831677 (1984) (organizational composition of the selection panel appeared to favor employees of certain components, but there was no showing that the protected group was underrepresented in those components). However, in a disparate treatment case, the failure of an agency to follow its own procedures can be indicative of pretext, although that showing alone is insufficient to establish pretext. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wielosinski v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A53923 (2006) (failure of selecting official to note reasons for selection on candidate referral list not indicative of discrimination); <span class="Italic">Roedel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A41587 (2005) ("Even if it were determined that management applied the incorrect procedure in the selection procedure, this by itself, is insufficient to support an inference of discrimination.").</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Jodi M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120142771 (2016), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant did present some evidence of a deviation from the normal selection procedures in the form of an affidavit from P4, who testified that the panelists would typically meet as a group and discuss the candidates before the final selection was made, and that that practice was not adhered to in this particular situation. P4 also averred that Complainant's interview responses were better than the Selectee's. IR 141-42. The SO and the other panelists, however, came to the conclusion that although Complainant and the Selectee were the two best qualified candidates, the Selectee had a slight edge by virtue of having had five years of clinical experience as a Pharmacist, while Complainant had only two years of pharmacy experience. IR 85-86, 111, 121, 131-32. Therefore, on the balance of the evidentiary record, we find, as did the Agency, that while Complainant was extremely well-qualified for the position, her qualifications were not plainly superior to those of the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kenny C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720150030 (2017), found discrimination where the agency arbitrarily waived the qualification standards for the selectee, who was initially not a candidate for the at-issue promotion, but applied the qualification standards to the complainant's application.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arleen L v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019002725 (2020), the agency aborted its planned selection procedure in the middle of the process. The agency initially planned to screen candidates using a "best qualified" grid and interviews. Complainant scored an 11 on the grid and advanced to the interview. The selectee scored a 6 and was not advanced. After the top five candidates were interviewed and the interview panel selected the complainant, the Associate Director, Caucasian, asked the panel to interview the selectee "as a professional courtesy." The Selecting Official instructed the panel to interview all candidates who applied for the position. The results of the next round of interviews in <span class="Italic">Arleen L.</span> were:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The primary panel interviewed all internal candidates who had not been initially selected for an interview. Based on their primary panel interviews, two African-American candidates received the highest and second highest scores cumulative points, with 75 and 68 points, respectively. Selectee was tied with a Hispanic (Puerto Rican) candidate for third place, with 67 points. Complainant and another candidate tied for fourth place, with 64 cumulative points. The top four candidates were advanced to the second-panel interview. Complainant was not offered a second interview because her score was too low. Selectee was selected following the second interview, which was conducted by a different panel.</p>
<p class="noindent">Panel Chair 1 testified that the original selection process was abandoned in order to favor the selectee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Members of the first-line interview panel (primary panel) attested to the selection process, which began with the screening and scoring of all candidates, using a "Best Qualified" (BQ) grid, which outlined the general information regarding each candidate's education, experience, and certifications. Based on these factors, Complainant received a score of 11 and Selectee received a score of 6. Selectee did not pass the BQ screening. Consequently, she did not advance in the selection process and receive an interview with the primary panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The chair of the primary panel (Panel Chair1) (African American, age 54) explained that Complainant and other candidates were far more advanced in their careers and possessed more experience than Selectee. She further explained that Complainant had more than 30 years' experience as a registered nurse, supervisor, assistant director, and manager, within and outside of the Agency. Panel Chair1 attested that Selectee possessed the basic qualifications and was able to articulate her responsibilities in her role as Nurse Manager for the past 60 days. Panel Chair1 also provided that, in her opinion, Selectee was not qualified for this position due to her lack of experience in the role as Nurse Manager. Following the primary panel interviews, the primary panel selected Complainant for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Panel Chair1 attested further to Complainant's qualifications for the position, noting that she was a Nurse Manager during 2005 and 2006 and 2010 and had been detailed as Nurse Manager in Outpatient Specialty Clinics in 2016. The other two members of the primary panel also attested to Complainant's qualifications for the position. Both noted her experience as Acting Nurse Manager for Specialty Clinics. One also noted Complainant's inpatient experience as an acting manager and indicated that, of the top three candidates on the BQ list, only Complainant had any appreciable leadership experience, so they felt she was the most qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 30, 2017, Panel Chair1 sent an email to the EEO investigator, under oath, stating that Associate Director originally told her to conduct the interviews, make a selection, and notify Selecting Official, but after the candidates had been screened, the top five candidates had been interviewed, and the selection had been made, Selecting Official rejected the selected candidate (Complainant). Panel Chair1 stated that Selecting Official said that they should have selected the top-ranked candidate, noting that the selected candidate was the second-ranked candidate. Panel Chair1 attested that when she informed Selecting Official the name of the highest-ranking candidate (also African-American), she rejected that candidate as well, and said they needed to re-interview the candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Panel Chair1 attested that Associate Director and Selecting Official expressed that they wanted Selectee to be selected for the Nurse Manager position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 1, 2017, Panel Chair1 emailed the EEO investigator and stated, under oath, that it was apparent that an individual of color would not be selected for the position. She explained that the interview process was altered in favor of one candidate, Selectee. When Selectee's experience was not enough to warrant selection, Selecting Official altered the process to give Selectee an unfair advantage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Panel Chair1 attested that she believed Complainant's race and age were factors in the selection process and Selectee fit the hiring/selection profile of Nurse Managers that have been selected over the past several years, which she described as "young, Caucasian, little or no experience."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Selecting Official in <span class="Italic">Arleen L</span>. defended the agency's actions":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Associate Director attested that the selection process used to fill the position was that Human Resources (HR) was to review candidates for minimum qualifications, then there would be a review to determine the best qualified, followed by first and second level interviews, reference checks, and selection. She denied being part of any interview or selection panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 18, 2017, Associate Director sent an email to the EEO investigator, under oath, stating that her justification for asking for a "professional courtesy" to have Selectee interviewed was that, when looking at the scoring grid for this position, it did not give any consideration to the years of nursing experience within the area of specialty care clinics and the weighting of the grid only considered total years of nursing regardless of the area of the field. She further explained that it is unusual to interview candidates with no prior experience in the clinical practice area for a management position to oversee the clinical practice and operations of those staff. Associate Director also indicated that she had a verbal discussion with Selecting Official to ensure all internal candidates had an opportunity to interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Selecting Official attested that the panel interviews were used to rate and rank the applicants. She confirmed that Selectee tied for third place and Complainant's score was tied for fourth place. When asked if the selection panel had ever presented Complainant's name to her as a "Best Qualified" candidate, Selecting Official could not recall.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Arleen L.</span> found the agency's actions to be "highly suggestive of preselection" and ordered retroactive placement of the complainant into the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facia</span> case of discrimination bases of race and/or age. To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, a complainant must show she is a member of the identified protected group, she was subjected to an adverse employment action, and similarly situated employees outside her protected class were treated more favorably in similar circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Furnco Constr. Corp</span>., 438 U.S. at 576. The record shows that Complainant, an African-American over 40, applied and was qualified for the Nurse Manager position; she was considered for the position in question; notwithstanding her qualifications, she was not selected for the position; and the selectee was outside of her protected classes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having made this determination, we now turn to whether the Agency has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Complainant's non-selection. Agency officials testified that after all the candidates were interviewed, Selectee was ranked in the top four, higher than <span id="Page_1582"></span>Complainant. As a result of her lower ranking, Complainant did not advance to a second interview and therefore was not considered during the final selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden returns to Complainant to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the articulated reason for her non-selection (that Selectee was better qualified) was a pretext designed to mask the true discriminatory motivations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record shows that the Agency initially planned to screen candidates using a BQ grid and interview candidates who scored highest on these objective criteria. Complainant was ranked among the best qualified, advanced to the interview, and was selected by the primary panel. Selectee, on the other hand, did not pass the BQ screening and failed to advance in the selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Selecting Official objected to Complainant as the selectee, initially because Complainant was ranked in second place. However, upon learning the identity of the candidate ranked in first place, another African-American, Selecting Official rejected that candidate as well. Selecting Official and Associate Director wanted Selectee to advance to an interview. Therefore, the selection process was changed to disregard the results of the BQ screening, interview all internal candidates, and make the selection based upon the interviews.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find this to be a deliberately subjective selection process and highly suggestive of preselection. The use of subjective criteria by a selecting official, while not impermissible, may offer a convenient pretext for unlawful discrimination. This is particularly true where a complainant is found to be objectively better qualified than the selectee. <span class="Italic">Thornton v. Coffey</span>, 618 F.2d 686, 691 (10th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990). <span class="Italic">Cf. Schultz v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Petition No. 05980483 (January 29, 1999) (age discrimination in promotion found where, even though selectee's "outstanding" rating was higher than appellant's "fully successful," there was no evidence the evaluations were a deciding factor in the decision, the appellant's qualifications were superior to the selectee's, the selectee lacked supervisory experience, and the Recommending Official's proffered reason for favoring the selectee "was subjective, and therefore, suspect").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked why the hiring process was changed, Associate Director stated that the BQ scoring grid did not give any consideration to the years of nursing experience within specialty care clinics and it was unusual to interview candidates with no prior experience in the clinical practice area for such a management position. However, the record shows that Selectee was considerably less experienced than Complainant and was unlikely to be able to compete for the position on the basis of such objective criteria. The Associate Director and Selecting Official were clear in their intention to alter the process to advantage Selectee over Complainant, an objectively more experienced and better qualified candidate. Moreover, there was no credible explanation proffered by the Agency for why the other African American candidate, ranked number one by the initial panel, was also not an acceptable selectee, or why one of the two top-ranked candidates (both African American) during the second panel process were also not chosen as the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that Complainant has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation was a pretext for unlawful discrimination in the selection process.</p>
