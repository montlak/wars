<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-40"><span class="space">11.</span> Mental Duress or Physical Inability</h4>
<p class="noindent">Mental duress or physical inability can be a basis to either toll the time limit for contacting a counselor or waive the time limit, depending on the specific circumstances. In some instances, the duress or inability could prevent a complainant from understanding that a personnel action has been taken, or from suspecting that the action may have been discriminatory. Far more common, however, are attempts by complainants to use mental duress or physical inability to have the time period for contacting a counselor waived. The issues of mental duress and physical inability are addressed in this section on waiver of the time period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mental duress alone is not a sufficient basis for waiving or tolling the time period. The appellant must show that the mental duress affected his physical or mental ability to file a timely complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Mahalia P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161137 (2016) ("When a complainant claims that a physical condition prevents her from meeting a particular filing deadline, we have held that in order to justify an untimely filing, a complainant must be so incapacitated by the condition as to render her physically unable to make a timely filing."); <span class="Italic">Southerland-Jackson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01983434 (1999) (employee was in hospital with brain tumor and unable to communicate); <span class="Italic">Eck v. USPS</span>, 01840503 (1985). Preoccupation with a serious medical condition is not sufficient grounds for waiving the time limit where several months elapse between the discovery of the alleged discriminatory treatment and contact of a counselor. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. USPS</span>, 01831777 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an employee is suffering from stress, even if she is under the care of a physician, is not sufficient, standing alone, to warrant a waiver of the time limit for contacting a counselor. The employee must show that because of physical or mental incapacitation, she was unable to timely initiate contact. <span class="Italic">See Hyde v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01995532 (2001) (even if the complainant was incapacitated for a period of time, incapacitation ended more than 45 days prior to counselor contact); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Kapp v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05940662 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a Part 1613 case, the Commission held that hospitalization due to mental health problems was sufficient grounds for extending the time limit for initiating precomplaint counseling where counseling was initiated within 30 days of release from the hospital. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Horowitz</span>, 05870417 (1988) (the employee was hospitalized on the day of his resignation for in-patient psychiatric care)<span class="Italic">; see also</span> <span class="Italic">In re Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05870295 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Hospitalization, however, is not required. The time limit for contacting a counselor was waived where the complainant was clearly aware of the alleged sexual harassment but was suffering from major depression at the time and was functioning under a reduced capacity. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05910489 (1991). The complainant produced statements from her therapist, both before and after her contact with a counselor, indicating that her level of functioning was reduced and that she was unable, because of the depression, to initiate counseling. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120100055 (2010) (detailed statement from psychologist about effects of major depression on complainant); <span class="Italic">Placides v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A03114 (2000) (the complainant submitted evidence from a licensed psychologist demonstrating an inability to timely initiate counselor contact).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, evidence that the complainant was under the care of a physician during the relevant period is not sufficient, standing alone, to support waiver or tolling of the time period. In addition, the complainant must present specific evidence that the medical condition prevented her from initiating timely contact with a counselor. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01944542 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sheel v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01961898 (1996), the Commission found that dismissal for untimely EEO counselor contact was improper given the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the appellant represents that he made several phone calls to an EEO Counselor at the agency's Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center in early 1995, but the calls were never returned. The appellant also indicates that he was hospitalized during the following periods of time: November 25, 1994-December 6, 1994, December 29, 1994-January 9, 1995, January 19, 1995 January 24, 1995, March 18, 1995-March 25, 1995, and April 9, 1995 April 13, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant submits a statement from his physician indicating that the appellant was hospitalized five times between November 25, 1994 and April 13, 1995. The physician informs the Commission that during that period of time the appellant was near death on several occasions, was under heavy medication, and was in no condition to correspond with EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant submits a statement from an agency employee who performed EEO counselor duties through January 31, 1995. The counselor indicates that due to his work load, he could not accept the appellant's complaint and that when he checked with another EEO counselor, her case load was also too heavy to accept the appellant's case. The counselor indicates that at the time communication with the <span id="Page_60"></span>appellant was very difficult because the appellant's health was very poor and he was in and out of the hospital, but that he recommended that the appellant contact an EEO counselor at the agency's Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120133092 (2014) ("The record further indicates that starting in August 2012, and for the next six months, she was in and out of treatment facilities. The documentation and statements she provides indicate that she was mentally unable to handle her own affairs and family had to provide her with assistance.").</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Madisetti v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120112432 (2013), the Commission upheld the agency's dismissal for untimely counselor contact some three years after the complainant's removal rejecting his contention that he was mentally unable to understand that he had been removed explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, Complainant did not initiate EEO Counselor contact until August 20, 2010. Complainant claimed that because of his disability he did not understand the actions being taken against him and he stated that he believed he was on administrative leave pending his reassignment back to the San Francisco office. Complainant claimed it was not until several years after his removal that, as a consequence of successful treatment of his disability, he came to suspect himself to have been the victim of discrimination while at Reno facility and began to look into the reasons for his removal. Complainant noted that in June 2010, he spoke with his father and that his father told him he had met with S1 at the time of the removal actions and that his father told him that S1 mentioned Complainant's disability and that this information led him to conclude the actions taken against him were related to his disability. Complainant also stated that it was not until he met with an attorney in June 2010, that he came to understand that he had rights and that his situation as a person suffering from a disability was covered by the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find Complainant has not offered adequate justification for an extension of the applicable time limit for initiating EEO Counselor contact until August 20, 2010. With regard to his claim of incapacitation, Complainant claims that he was so incapacitated by his disability at the time of his removal in 2007, and thereafter that he could not contact an EEO Counselor until August 20, 2010. While Complainant claims he was hospitalized briefly in December 2006, was hospitalized longer in 2007, and then received outpatient treatment, we note Complainant provides no documentation establishing any of his purported hospital stays.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does contain documentation that Complainant was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia as contained on a Psychiatric Evaluation form Doctor X dated March 11, 2010. Additionally, Complainant provides a December 6, 2010 letter from a social worker with the Queens Hospital Center, Adult Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic. The social worker stated that Complainant has been attending the clinic since January 2008, and has been receiving medication management and individual sessions. The social worker noted that during his time at the clinic, Complainant has fully complied with his treatment recommendations, has remained clinically stable, and has not been psychiatrically hospitalized. The social worker stated that over the last six months it appears that Complainant is more able to return to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains a December 8, 2010 letter from a psychiatrist from the Queens Hospital Center. The psychiatrist acknowledged regularly treating Complainant for his condition since January 2008. The psychiatrist stated that Complainant's condition is currently stable and continues to improve. The psychiatrist noted Complainant has significantly improved from prior years and stated his thought process is organized, logical, and coherent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The psychiatrist stated that Complainant's condition has been stable for more than six months and he can return to his previous work without limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other than Complainant's contentions, we note Complainant provides no documentation concerning his medical condition at the time of his 2007 removal or his 2009 non-selection. Even were we to accept that Complainant himself was so incapacitated by his condition that he could not meet the time deadline at least for some time following his March 2007 removal or September 2009 non-selection, the record reveals that following his removal Complainant filed for social security disability benefits, which he began receiving in May 2007; applied for employment in September 2009; served jury duty for five days in December 2009; and based on the statements from his medical providers as of June 2010, was clinically stable and able to return to work. However, Complainant did not initiate EEO Counselor contact until August 20, 2010. Complainant has not shown that he was so incapacitated during the relevant time frame so as to prevent him from timely initiating EEO Counselor contact or, even with an extension due to his health, has not shown that he needed a three-year extension after his removal and nearly a year extension following his non-selection due to his medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Rosie T. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120152509 (2015), where the complainant alleged that a stroke shortly after the alleged discrimination prevented her from timely counselor contact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant's claim that despite her due diligence, she was prevented from pursing the EEO process due to her medical conditions, we observe that Complainant stated that in February 2012, she suffered a stroke which caused her extreme mental incapacity. When a complainant claims that a physical condition prevents her from meeting a particular filing deadline, we have held that in order to justify an untimely filing, the complainant must be so incapacitated by the condition as to render her physically unable to make a timely filing. <span class="Italic">See Zelmer v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890164 (March 8, 1989). The same is true regarding claims of incapacity related to psychiatric or psychological conditions. <span class="Italic">See Crear v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920700 (October 29, 1992). There is nothing in the record, such as medical documentation, supporting Complainant's assertion that she was so incapacitated during the applicable forty-five day period as to prevent her from timely initiating EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mere job-related stress will not suffice to excuse an untimely complaint. The complainant must present specific medical documentation that the stress rendered him unable to timely initiate counseling. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Sohal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954667 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same is true regarding claims of incapacity related to psychiatric or psychological conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crear v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920700 (October 29, 1992). The record reflects that appellant described experiencing severe depression and anxiety as a consequence of stress on the job. Appellant claims that he was unable to make decisions. We find that the record does not contain sufficient medical documentation to support appellant's assertion that he was so incapacitated as to have been unable to initiate EEO counseling in a timely manner. We note that although a clinical psychologist described appellant's complaints, he did not state his opinion regarding appellant's purported incapacitation. Appellant has not presented adequate justification for an extension of the 45-day limitation period. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint on the grounds of untimely EEO contact was proper and is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, on reconsideration, in <span class="Italic">Sohal v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970461 (1997), the Commission gave the appellant a second chance to submit medical evidence of incapacitation, and advised him to obtain a representative to help him process his case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, appellant has submitted medical evidence on reconsideration which elaborates upon his psychologist's previous indication that he experienced severe depression beginning on the date of the September 14, 1994 incident. We note that the decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01954667 properly found that the medical evidence in the record at that time did not sufficiently support appellant's allegation of incapacitation in that his psychologist had not indicated a specific opinion regarding whether the depression caused him to be unable to contact an EEO Counselor in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, our review of the medical evidence submitted by appellant with his request for reconsideration indicates that it clearly describes the negative effect of appellant's continuous and severe depression and its attendant medication on appellant's ability to pursue his EEO claim, and opines that he was unable to contact an EEO Counselor during the relevant time period due to these factors. We find that this documentation provides sufficient elaboration on and corroboration of appellant's prior assertions of incapacitation to warrant an extension of the time period for timely EEO Counselor contact. Therefore, we will GRANT reconsideration of the previous decision pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.407(c)(1), REVERSE the agency's final decision and REMAND appellant's complaint to the agency for continued processing. However, appellant is advised that in the future, specific medical evidence will be required from the outset to support any request for an extension of a time limitations period under our regulations. Appellant is also reminded that he is, at all times, responsible for proceeding with his complaint, regardless of whether he has designated a representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(e). Given appellant's past periods of incapacitation, we encourage him to secure a representative in order to ensure that the processing of this case proceeds in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Parker v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05960065 (1997), the Commission found that its previous decision, determining that the appellant had the capacity to seek timely EEO counselor contact following hospitalization for a suicide attempt, was in error:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that appellant was hospitalized from October 23, 1992, through November 13, 1992, following a suicide attempt. Thus, the limitation period for initiating a complaint should have been tolled during that period<span class="Italic">. See Ostrenga v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890060 (May 22, 1989). Further, the Courts have held that a complainant's mental condition may also justify tolling the limitation period, if the impairment renders the complainant incompetent and incapable of handling his own affairs<span class="Italic">. Speiser v. Dept. of Health &#x0026; <span id="Page_61"></span>Human Services</span>, 43 FEP Cases 1363 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The agency has acknowledged that appellant was incapacitated prior to December 22, 1992. The Commission disagrees with the previous decision's finding that appellant was able to handle his affairs after that time. While appellant requested documentation concerning the denial of promotion and wrote to OPM, the record reveals that the request comprised merely a list of documents, some of which do not appear to relate to the promotion. In addition, appellant was able to write to OPM only with the assistance of an individual at the Disabled American Veterans Association. Appellant's psychiatrist stated that, during the time in question, appellant had a number of problems with his thought process; and took a significant amount of medication which made it difficult for him to think logically and clearly, and affected his awareness of the factors surrounding his employment situation and the agency's time limitations. Thus, the Commission finds that appellant has submitted sufficient justification for extending the limitation period beyond 45 days. Accordingly, the agency should accept appellant's complaint for processing pursuant to the applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McBride v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956327 (1996), the Commission found merit in the complainant's contention that her mental condition prevented her from contacting an EEO counselor in a timely manner. In that case, the Commission accepted medical evidence that the complainant suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of years of spousal abuse. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Ragels v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a60009.txt">05A60009</a> (2006), the Commission found that the complainant was mentally unable to timely initiate contact with a counselor where he submitted evidence from a VA health care professional that he suffered from PTSD and that his "mental capacity was severely compromised" to the point that he could not make any kind of decision. The health care professional also stated that the complainant isolated himself and was unable to leave his residence for some nine months.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, PTSD and depression were found to incapacitate the complainant for timely initiating counselor contact in <span class="Italic">O'Neill v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120103027 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, for example, that by letter dated February 3, 2010, Complainant's physician stated that complainant had been unable to work since June 2009, that she was incapable of presently working due to symptoms related to post traumatic stress disorder, and it was undetermined when she could return to work. We note further that in another letter dated August 18, 2010, Complainant's physician stated that complainant was in a depressed mood, had suffered from severe anxiety, panic attacks, sleep disruption, impaired concentration, and hyper vigilance; and that the symptoms involve a "psychological and physiological reactivity when exposed to triggers or reminders of the Post Office, such as seeing postal trucks or interacting with personnel." The physician concluded that complainant had been "incapacitated from initiating EEO counseling." Based on the foregoing, the Commission determines that Complainant was sufficiently incapacitated so as to warrant the tolling of the time limit for initiating EEO counseling. <span class="Italic">See Crear v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920700 (October 29, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that the complainant be under medical treatment at the time the deadline for initiating counseling passes if she can otherwise establish that she was mentally incapable of understanding the need to initiate counseling at that time. In <span class="Italic">Maddux v. Postmaster General</span>, 05980302 (1999), the complainant presented evidence that she did not seek medical treatment until the time limit for counseling had passed, but the medical evaluation conducted at the outset of treatment demonstrated that she had a severely diminished capacity for several months before seeking treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an employee is able to file and pursue a workers' compensation claim is ample indication that he is not incapacitated for purposes of making contact with an EEO counselor. <span class="Italic">Palmucci v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975286 (1998). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mahalia P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161137 (2016) (rejecting complainant's claim that PTSD and depression precluded timely filing where complainant was able to work during the relevant time period and filed a grievance on the matter).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Grom v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01970718 (1998), the Commission found that, although the complainant was present at work during the relevant time period, she was unable to perform the analytical aspects of her job and was incapacitated for purposes of EEO contact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant contends that she was unable to seek EEO counseling until after the sensing/mediation session of March 5, 1996 because of a relapse of her PTSD. She was diagnosed with PTSD stemming from childhood events, and was in treatment for this and depression from 1989 to 1992, including a four week hospitalization. The appellant commenced treatment again in May with a joint treating psychiatrist and a licensed clinical social worker. Letters from them indicate that the appellant had a relapse as a result of the "sensing" session of March 5, 1996. There is evidence that the appellant was severely confronted in the session by her staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letters indicate that thereafter, the appellant had extremely severe PTSD symptoms including high levels of depression and anxiety, frequent panic attacks (up to six times daily), sleep disturbance, poor concentration, obsessive-compulsive behaviors and flashbacks. One letter states that while there is a 45 day time limit to seek EEO counseling, the PTSD symptoms prevented her from taking any affirmative action on her behalf for a full two months. The appellant worked during this time period. Her health care providers stated, however, that it was all but impossible for her to perform the analytical aspects of her job, and her deputy affirmed that she was unable to perform her daily duties and that he took over the daily operations for at least three months. Much of the information in the medical letters was corroborated by statements from the appellant and her husband.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the appellant submitted sufficient justification to toll the running of the time limit to seek EEO counseling with regard to the instant complaint. The statements of the appellant and her husband, as corroborated by the appellant's treating psychiatrist, licensed clinical social worker, and deputy, regarding the appellant being delayed in contacting an EEO counselor due to the active severe symptoms of PTSD were persuasive. Accordingly, all the allegations which the appellant raised in connection with her complaint that occurred 45 days before March 5, 1996 (January 20, 1996), are timely....</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the complainant establishes that he was medically incapacitated, such evidence will not necessarily be sufficient to justify a waiver of the time limit. For example, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 05990531 (2001), the complainant submitted evidence on reconsideration that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and was completely disabled for three months. However, the evidence also established that the complainant did not contact a counselor for another 18 months.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that did not involve the time period for contacting a counselor, but the time period for filing a civil action, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that being represented by an attorney is not a bar to having the Title VII statute of limitations equitably tolled. In <span class="Italic">Stoll v. Runyon</span>, 165 F.3d 1238 (9th Cir. 1999), the court found that egregious sexual harassment, which included being repeatedly raped by a supervisor, had left the plaintiff so psychologically scarred that she was unable to understand or assert her rights. Although the plaintiff was represented by an attorney, the evidence demonstrated that the plaintiff was unable to communicate directly with her attorney and could not open mail, other than in the presence of her therapist. The court found that equitable tolling was appropriate on two alternative bases. First, the court found that the Postal Service was not entitled to benefit from its own outrageous conduct by having the suit dismissed. Second, the court found that the plaintiff's mental incapacity was an "exceptional circumstance" because of the effect it had on her relationship with her lawyer.</p>
