<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-136"><span class="space">FF.</span> TRANSPORTATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">The precise parameters of the Commission's position between transportation to and from work and reasonable accommodation have been unclear. As a result, believe that an agency is never obligated to consider an accommodation that involves transportation because those who cannot get to work cannot perform any of a position's essential functions. Others have gone as far as believing that an agency must accommodate an employee's transportation difficulties in getting to and from work. The truth of the matter lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, an agency is not required to get an employee to and from work as a reasonable accommodation, though an agency may have provide accommodations that assist a qualified individual in overcoming transportation problems if it would not create an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, <span class="Italic">Renteria v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120071044 (2009), the agency provided an effective accommodation with a modified workshift that addresses both the employee's and the agency's needs rather than excusing an employee from a rotating work shift. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Renteria</span> worked as a medical technician. Medical technicians were required to work a rotating schedule that periodically required work on a third shift. The complainant, who had a hearing impairment and also developed an eye condition that affected peripheral and night vision, sought an accommodation of being excused from third shift work so that she could drive to and from work in daylight. Instead, the agency provided her with a modified third shift from 11:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 7:45 <span class="small">P.M.</span> instead of the normal third shift from 12:15 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to 9 <span class="small">P.M.</span> The agency further gave the complainant liberal leave when she believed that weather conditions might affect her ability to drive. The Commission found that the agency had provided the complainant with reasonable accommodation since the work shift modifications were effective even though they were not the employee's preferred accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120081831 (2011), the Commission found that the complainant was not entitled to a reasonable accommodation for her transportation problems where there was no evidence her disability was connected to the accommodation she sought. The complainant in that case suffered from polio, used crutches, did not drive and had a difficult time using public transportation. Instead, she relied on a transportation service to get her to and from work. In order to work credit hours, the complainant sought an accommodation in the form of being <span id="Page_1405"></span>excused from a negotiated policy that credit hours could not be earned until after the end of her assigned shift. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant by changing the policy because her inability to work credit hours was the result of her desire to not work later than 5:45 <span class="small">P.M</span>. instead of any actual transportation problem related to her disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleges that the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate her physical disability, specifically her request to earn credit hours by starting work before 8:00<span class="small"> A.M</span>. We assume for purposes of this analysis, without so finding, that Complainant has established that she is a qualified individual with a disability, and therefore is entitled to reasonable accommodation. We find that, even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Complainant, she did not establish that the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant contends that because of her disability, she utilizes a transportation service to get to and from work which requires her to leave work before 6:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, thus preventing her from staying past 6:00 <span class="small">P.M</span>. in order to earn credit hours as required by the agreement. The evidence of record establishes, however, that this contention by Complainant is without merit. As a "subscription service" customer, Complainant was permitted to modify her pick up and drop off times. All changes were subject to space availability and were limited to 40% of the customer's monthly trips or less.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Therefore, the record indicates that Complainant was able to change her pick up time in order to be available to earn credit hours. Based on the evidence, it appears that Complainant did not change her duty hours or scheduled pick up time because she did not want to stay at the office any later than 5:45.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was advised by management that in order for her to earn credit hours she had to work until 6:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Although reminded, the record reflects that between January 4 and March 27, 2006, Complainant violated the policy 23 times. As a result of the many violations, Complainant was restricted from taking advantage of the credit hour policy for a period of approximately three weeks. Complainant, along with other employees requested that the Agency revise the policy or permit the credit hours portion to go unenforced. The Agency declined to do so. Complainant was again offered the option to participate in the credit hours policy, and was advised that she must work until 6:00 <span class="small">P.M</span>. in order to earn hours. The record reflects that Complainant again failed to adhere to the policy, and was permanently prohibited from participating in the credit hour policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has failed to present any evidence which effectively establishes that her disability prevents her from working her regular tour of duty. The Agency is not required to provide an accommodation which Complainant fails to establish is necessary to enable her to perform the essential functions of her position, or to gain equal access to a benefit or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">Frische v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120071609 (July 1, 2009) (citing <span class="Italic">McGuffin v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A14173 (Dec. 3, 2002)). We find that Complainant requested to earn credit hours in a fashion outside of the normal policy for reasons unrelated to her impairment; rather she wished to avoid working until 6:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Accordingly she failed to show how leaving earlier than the time required to earn credit hours was a reasonable accommodation that enabled her to perform the essential functions of her position as a Data Contact Representative on the second shift. Based on a review of the evidence, we find that Complainant was not denied a reasonable accommodation in 2006, because she failed to establish a nexus between her asserted disabling condition and the requested accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Frische</span>, Appeal No. 0120071609 (citing <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120055839 (Oct. 18, 2007); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A42650 (Sept. 2, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency is not required to provide transportation to its facilities as a reasonable accommodation, the fact that the request for accommodation relates to transportation does not remove it from the ambit of reasonable accommodation is provided by <span class="Italic">Philippe v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A12653 (2003), discussed more fully earlier in this chapter in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-24-174.html#sec15-149">Teleworking as an Accommodation</a>." In <span class="Italic">Phillippe</span>, the Commission found the agency failed to make reasonable accommodation by not considering the complainant's request for a transfer to another facility because of an agency policy that precluded accommodation with regard to transportation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0720130029 (2015), the Commission gave a good explanation of an agency's obligation to accommodate a disability-related travel problem:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that the Agency has not shown that Complainant's inability to commute to the Minneapolis office has resulted in any significant or consequential deficiencies in his job performance with respect to monitoring housing authority compliance, working with colleagues, responding to audits, or communicating with housing authorities and officials. In fact, the Agency rated him at least "fully successful" throughout the relevant time period when he was unable to report to Minneapolis. The evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that Complainant has performed the essential functions of his position without regularly reporting to the Minneapolis office. Consequently, we find that the record supports the AJ's finding that Complainant was qualified for his Financial Analyst position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in the federal sector, federal district and circuit court decisions may be persuasive or instructive, but are not binding on the Commission. <span class="Italic">Montemorra v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 01A41536 (Aug. 2, 2005). Moreover, Commission precedent clearly has established that a request for telecommuting or a shorter commuting time because of a disability triggers an Agency's responsibility under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080833 (July 18, 2012) (agency denied complainant a reasonable accommodation when it did not grant his request to telecommute because of condition);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that providing disabled employees with the reasonable accommodations of telecommuting or reassignment to a closer office is consistent with the Rehabilitation Act's goal of assuring "equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency" for individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12101(a)(7). In this case, because Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability, the Agency had a duty to engage in the interactive process to determine if there was an effective reasonable accommodation for his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the Agency had not demonstrated that Complainant's requested accommodations would constitute an undue hardship on the Agency. Specifically, the AJ found that onsite trips to housing authorities were few and far between because there were only one or two troubled PHAs in Complainant's territory; mail could be scanned and sent to Complainant electronically on the secured network; Complainant only needed to attend an occasional training or conference in-person; Complainant was able to participate in meetings and trainings via videoconference and telephone; and there was no evidence that the amount of documents kept exclusively in the Minneapolis office that had to be scanned or sent to Complainant electronically was excessive. In so finding, the AJ noted that the record revealed that Complainant had only conducted one onsite review in the eight years he had been in his position. The AJ further noted that, although Complainant's physician's restrictions prohibited him from regularly driving between Minneapolis and Madison, the physician permitted him to "come to the office occasionally" to attend important meetings or necessary training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these specific circumstances, we find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that Complainant's requested accommodations would not constitute an undue hardship on the Agency and, therefore, the Agency denied him a reasonable accommodation for his disability. In so finding, we note that the fact that Complainant received a "fully successful" annual evaluation while telecommuting 100 percent of the time greatly undermines the Agency's contention that his inability to report to the Minneapolis office creates an undue burden on the Agency. Finally, we remind the Agency that the federal government is charged with the goal of being a "model employer" of individuals with disabilities, which may require it to consider innovation, fresh approaches, and technology as effective methods of providing reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">Rowlette v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A10816 (Aug. 1, 2003); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). We believe that providing Complainant with this reasonable accommodation furthers this goal.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Gerald L. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130776 (2015), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the transportation limitations of a physician with sleep apnea who could not drive more than 25 miles unaccompanied. Due to a realignment, the complainant, a rheumatologist, assigned to the agency's Tulsa facility was required to see patients two days a week at the agency's Muskogee facility, a drive of approximately 30 miles. As accommodations, the complainant requested that he not be assigned to see patients at the Muskogee facility, that he be provided with a driver if he was required to see patients at that facility, or that he be allowed to ride a patient bus to and from the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Gerald L</span>., found that the agency had not failed to accommodate the complainant in denying his requests and subsequently removing him for medical inability to perform:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the provision of a driver to Complainant twice weekly to Muskogee, the accommodation was not reasonable. The Agency had no responsibility to provide transportation to Complainant for his commute.[8] A reasonable accommodation "must be reasonable on its face," i.e. plausible or feasible. <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02; <span class="Italic">Silvestri v. Tenn. Valley Auth</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A22175 (Sept. 29, 2004).[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Hackney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01984048 (Aug. 22, 2001) <span class="Italic">citing Hupka v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 02960003 (Aug. 13, 1997) for proposition that disability <span id="Page_1406"></span>accommodations related to commuting can be required under the Rehabilitation Act in appropriate circumstances. <span class="Italic">See also Johnson v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Request No. 0720130029 (Feb. 12, 2015) (request to reconsider pending in EEOC Request No. 0520150357); <span class="Italic">Southerland v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120091983 (June 15, 2010) (if a complainant requests a shorter commute as a reasonable accommodation, an agency must examine whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity and how the requested accommodation would enable the employee to "get" to work).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Barnett</span> cited in <span class="Italic">Wiley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A20105 (Sept. 15, 2003), <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A40147 (Dec. 11, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Excusing Complainant from serving patients in Muskogee was also not reasonable and would also have posed an undue hardship on the Agency, resulting in the denial of service to patients closer to their homes and always having them to drive further away from the Muskogee area to the Tulsa facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the use of the patient shuttle, Complainant maintained during the hearing that not only patients used the shuttle but, also, that employees used the shuttle routinely. On the other hand, the Agency asserted that the shuttle could not be used by employees to commute to and from their duty location. Federal agencies, according to the Agency, were not permitted to use appropriated funds to get an employee to work. Describing Complainant's commuting costs as personal expenses, the Agency asserted that they were not payable from appropriated funds, absent specific statutory authority and it relied on 17 Comp. Gen. 1 (1947); 16 Comp. Gen. 64 (1936). The Agency also argued that 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1344(a)(1) limited the use of appropriated funds for passenger vehicles to "official purposes." The Agency also cited a 2006 decision from the Comptroller General, General Accounting Office (GAO) which addressed the use of appropriated funds for a shuttle bus service to facilitate the commutes of U.S. Capitol police employees and determined that such use was inappropriate. In the 2006 decision, the GAO stated as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This limitation applies to any portion of the trip between home and work. B8-261729, Apr. 1, 1996. The Naval Air Systems Command, for example, could not use appropriated funds for a bus to transport on a daily basis, employees from their then-current headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to relocated headquarters in St. Mary's County, Maryland. Once the Command moved its offices, the place of employment for its employees would be the new location: "[a]ll of the usual expenses incurred by an employee prior to his arrival at that location, whether or not he makes an intermediate stop at a different location, are commuting expenses." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Allowing the use of the shuttle would constitute an undue hardship if, to allow Complainant to use the shuttle regularly in order to get to Muskogee, would have contravened regulations. The Commission is not prepared to order the Agency to impose such an accommodation. While it may be that employees were allowed to use the patient shuttle on occasion to attend such things as a meeting or if an unexpected event arose, there is no evidence that employees were routinely and regularly using the shuttle as transportation to get to their duty stations or that disabled employees were treated disparately concerning its use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the shuttle was being used by employees regularly or routinely to go to their tours of duty, the accommodation would not have been effective given Complainant's duties. The shuttle's regular schedule was from 8:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. to 4:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. Complainant had to see and treat patients and was restricted to a six-hour workday. Complainant had also asked for time during his workday to nap because of his sleep apnea and so that he could use the CPAP machine. Considering these factors, the number of patients that Complainant could see would have been affected. Enforcement Guidance provides that an employer does not have to eliminate an essential function of a position to accommodate an individual with a disability. Neither is an employer required to create a job as a form of reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Castaneda v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01951445 (Sept. 18, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Seeing and treating patients was an essential function of Complainant's position as a rheumatologist. Complainant's working hours would have to remain reduced because of his condition. There was no evidence that the restriction would only last for a temporary period of time. That meant that the number of patients that could be seen by Complainant would necessarily be reduced. In addition, Complainant had several physical limitations, including not being able to perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should he have to resuscitate a patient that he was seeing. An employer is not required to lower performance standards in order to accommodate an individual with a disability. Neither is the employer required to come up with make do work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence that there was another rheumatologist available or an equivalent vacant position that Complainant could fill. The Agency was not required to create a position for a disabled employee, nor was it required to transform light or limited assignments into permanent jobs to accommodate an employee's disability. <span class="Italic">Mengine v. Runyon</span>, 114 F. 3d 415, 418 (3d Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Woodard v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A21682 (July 29, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency did offer Complainant an accommodation of part-time work to Complainant. It would have allowed the Agency to hire another physician to provide services to the patients in Muskogee. Complainant refused the offer. We have consistently held that an agency does not have to offer an employee the accommodation of his choice, only one that is effective. Part-time work would have been an effective accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the AJ determined, and the Agency argued, that Complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability because Complainant could not perform an essential function of his position, i.e., attendance. We have stated in our Guidance that attendance is not an essential function of a job as defined by the Rehabilitation Act because it is not one of the fundamental job duties of the employment position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n). Essential functions "are the duties of a job," that is, "the outcomes that must be achieved by someone in that position." <span class="Italic">Petitioner v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Petition No. 0320110053 (July 10, 2014); <span class="Italic">Ta v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013); <span class="Italic">Finnegan v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980065 (Sept. 26, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning his termination, Complainant was discharged because he was not medically qualified to hold the position. Dr. A is a specialist in occupational medicine and a fellow in the Academy of Disability Evaluating Physicians. He is a Master in the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a certified independent medical examiner, and a certified examiner for disability and impairment ratings. He reviewed information from Complainant's neurosurgeon who had indicated that Complainant had cervical cord compression and myelopathy resulting in difficulty holding his head upright, altered sensation in the upper extremities, foot pain, decreased coordination, abnormal reflexes, and significant bowel and bladder retention. Complainant's neurosurgeon noted that the cord compression would worsen after six hours and therefore Complainant could work only six hours a day, see one patient an hour, and work only from 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Complainant could not drive more than 20 to 25 miles to work. Complainant was also not able to bend, pull the footrest on the patient examination table, and had a 15-pound lifting restriction. Based on the observations of Complainant's physician, Dr. A determined that the Agency could not accommodate Complainant's duties, which included 30-minute appointments of eight hours a day based on clinic requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.&#x2003;A also concluded that Complainant was at imminent risk of serious harm to himself as a result of the cervical cord compression which could result in paraplegia or quadriplegia. The risk was present at six hours a day or greater than six hours a day. Altered sensation in the fingers, abnormal coordination, inability to hold his head upright, "distraction" from pain and bowel and bladder dysfunction would adversely affect Complainant's ability to examine patients and safely perform procedures such as injections, placing patients at imminent risk of serious harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.&#x2003;A's report and Complainant's medical information were submitted to the Agency's Physical Standards Board (Board) whose responsibility it was to determine Complainant's eligibility to meet the physical standards of his position. The Board concluded that Complainant could not perform the essential functions of his position without hazard to Agency beneficiaries, employees or to himself. The Board opined that the essential functions of Complainant's position would exceed the limitations identified by his physician and Dr. A's opinion. Exceeding the limitations would lead to a worsening of Complainant's medical conditions.</p>
