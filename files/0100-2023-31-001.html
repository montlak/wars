</header>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1973"></span>Fortunately, for many of us, Shakespeare's Dick the Butcher never got his way. Instead of doing away with the lawyer who represents the employee, there comes a point in time where he or she must be paid. For the unsuccessful complainant, payment of fees is strictly a matter between the attorney and his/her client. Under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, a successful complainant may recover attorney fees in the administrative process from the agency. Attorney fees are routinely awarded to prevailing parties, absent "special circumstances." <span class="Italic">Qazei v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01873357 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises</span>, 390 U.S. 400, 88 S. Ct. 964 (1975)). The purpose of the provision making fees available to prevailing plaintiffs "is to encourage private litigants to act as 'private attorneys general.'" <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05880813 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Newman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra)</span>. There is no similar provision for attorney fees in the ADEA and, thus, attorney fees are not recoverable in the administrative process in cases involving age discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's 1999 amendments to Part 1614 did not alter the substantive law with regard to attorney fee awards in discrimination cases. However, the amendments do provide that, in complaints subject to a decision by an administrative judge, fee requests should be submitted to the judge instead of to the agency, as was formerly required. This results in two important changes. First, the administrative judge who heard the case, and not the agency, decides on whether an award is warranted and the amount of the award. Second, the agency may not reject or modify the award. If it decides not to fully implement the decision of the administrative judge awarding attorney fees, the agency must appeal that decision to OFO and the agency bears the burden of proof on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Attorney fees properly are considered part of the relief available to the successful complainant. The Commission's general guidance on fees is set forth at 29 CFR 1614.501(e):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Attorney's fees or costs</span>--(1) <span class="Italic">Awards of attorney's fees or costs</span>. The provisions of this paragraph relating to the award of attorney's fees or costs shall apply to allegations of discrimination prohibited by title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In a decision or final action, the agency, administrative judge, or Commission may award the applicant or employee reasonable attorney's fees (including expert witness fees) and other costs incurred in the processing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;A finding of discrimination raises a presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Any award of attorney's fees or costs shall be paid by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;Attorney's fees are allowable only for the services of members of the Bar and law clerks, paralegals or law students under the supervision of members of the Bar, except that no award is allowable for the services of any employee of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iv)&#x2003;Attorney's fees shall be paid for services performed by an attorney after the filing of a written complaint, provided that the attorney provides reasonable notice of representation to the agency, administrative judge or Commission, except that fees are allowable for a reasonable period of time prior to the notification of representation for any services performed in reaching a determination to represent the complainant. Agencies are not required to pay attorney's fees for services performed during the pre-complaint process, except that fees are allowable when the Commission affirms on appeal an administrative judge's decision finding discrimination after an agency takes final action by not implementing an administrative judge's decision. Written submissions to the agency that are signed by the representative shall be deemed to constitute notice of representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Amount of awards.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;When the agency, administrative judge or the Commission determines an entitlement to attorney's fees or costs, the complainant's attorney shall submit a verified statement of attorney's fees (including expert witness fees) and other costs, as appropriate, to the agency or administrative judge within 30 days of receipt of the decision and shall submit a copy of the statement to the agency. A statement of attorney's fees and costs shall be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing the attorney's charges for legal services. The agency may respond to a statement of attorney's fees and costs within 30 days of its receipt. The verified statement, accompanying affidavit and any agency response shall be made a part of the complaint file.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)(A)&#x2003;The agency or administrative judge shall issue a decision determining the amount of attorney's fees or costs due within 60 days of receipt of the statement and affidavit. The decision shall include a notice of right to appeal to the EEOC along with EEOC Form 573, Notice Of Appeal/Petition and shall include the specific reasons for determining the amount of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;The amount of attorney's fees shall be calculated using the following standards: The starting point shall be the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. There is a strong presumption that this amount represents the reasonable fee. In limited circumstances, this amount may be reduced or increased in consideration of the degree of success, quality of representation, and long delay caused by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(C)&#x2003;The costs that may be awarded are those authorized by 28 USC 1920 to include: Fees of the reporter for all or any of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses; and fees for exemplification and copies necessarily obtained for use in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;Witness fees shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of 28 USC 1821, except that no award shall be made for a Federal employee who is in a duty status when made available as a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where the complainant has not requested a hearing, the agency still issues a final decision on fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two separate issues with respect to an award of attorney fees. The first issue is the complainant's entitlement to fees. Resolution of this issue entails determining whether the complainant is the prevailing party. The second issue is the amount of an award, if one is warranted. This is generally determined by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by the reasonable hourly rate of the attorney. This general formula is known as the "lodestar" and is the starting point, and usually the end point, in determining the amount of a fee award. Both the issues of prevailing party status and the application of the lodestar are discussed in detail below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though usually considered part of an attorney fee award, the successful complainant in a Title VII or Rehabilitation Act case may also recover the costs of litigation. Obviously, no attorney fee award can be made in a case where the complainant was not represented by an attorney. The same is not true of costs. The successful complainant may recover the costs of litigation even if he or she was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> or represented by a nonattorney representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">In most instances, separate final agency decisions or separate final agency actions are issued on the underlying claim of discrimination and any subsequent fee award. Because only prevailing parties are entitled to fee awards, the two-step process makes sense. However, the Commission significantly confused its position on the relationship of a decision on fees to the underlying finding of discrimination in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01970890 (1998). In that case, the Commission held that an agency decision with a finding of discrimination is not a final agency decision until the agency also issues a decision on the fee award. In other words, under <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the agency apparently should not issue one final agency decision with a finding of discrimination and another with a finding on attorney fees. Rather, it should issue one final decision addressing both matters. This does raise a question about what form the agency's decision to issue a finding of discrimination should take. Obviously, a complainant does not know that he or she is eligible for a fee award, nor the time frame for submitting a request, until he or she is advised of the agency's finding of discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> does not explain how all this is to be done within 60 days of receipt of an administrative judge's decision or a request for decision on the record. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05910615 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations seem to contemplate separate decisions on the underlying claim of discrimination and attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.110; 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2). Those regulations outline a process whereby a decision on the claim of discrimination is made and, if discrimination is found, the complainant is given notice of entitlement to a fee award and a subsequent decision is made on the amount of the award. In all likelihood, <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> and <span class="Italic">Brooks</span> stand more for the proposition that an agency may not dispense with relief and fee award issues in a form other than a final decision or action subject to appeal. It would appear to be of little consequence whether that is done through separate final decisions or one final decision. See also <a href="0100-2023-16-001.html#sec7-1">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In reviewing agency decisions on fee awards, the Commission is not restricted to consideration of the evidence that was before the agency. It will consider information submitted by the appellant in support of a fee petition, even when that evidence was not submitted to the agency. <span class="Italic">Work v. Postmaster General</span>, 01920209 (1992).</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec22-2"><span id="Page_1974"></span><span class="space">I.</span> PROCEDURES FOR SUBMITTING FEE REQUEST</h2>
<p class="noindent">The procedures for submitting requests for attorney fees are set forth at 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2). If the complainant has not requested a hearing or has requested a final agency decision on the record, the request for fees must be submitted to the agency. If the complaint has been subject to a decision by an administrative judge, the request for fees must be submitted to the judge. The complainant's attorney is required to submit a verified statement of fees and costs to the agency or the administrative judge within 30 days of receipt of the judge's decision, the final agency decision, or the final decision of the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations and guidance on the timing of attorney fee petitions are not a model of clarity, particularly for cases decided by administrative judges, but MD-110 at 11-17 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the decision-making authority, that is, the agency, an administrative judge, or the Commission, issues a decision finding discrimination, the decision normally should provide, under the standards set forth above, for the complainant's entitlement to attorney's fees and costs. The complainant's attorney then must submit a verified statement of attorney's fees (including expert witness fees) and other costs, as appropriate, to the agency or administrative judge within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision and must submit a copy of the statement to the agency. 1614.501(e)(2)(i).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Where the Commission finds discrimination in a case in which the agency takes final action under 1614.110(a), the Commission will remand the case to the Administrative Judge for a determination of attorney's fees. Where the decision on appeal originates from a case handled exclusively by the agency (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, where the complainant elected a final agency decision under 1614.110(b)), the Commission will remand the case to the agency for a determination of attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The reference in MD-110 to remanding the case to the administrative judge or the agency would seem to indicate an intent on the part of the Commission that fee requests would not be submitted to the administrative judge when an appeal is filed. Instead, if the Commission upholds a finding of discrimination by the administrative judge, the case would be remanded to the judge for issuance of a fee decision. Similarly, if the Commission reverses a final agency decision and enters a finding of discrimination, it will remand the case to the agency for a determination of fees. In either event, the decision of the administrative judge or agency on fees is subject to appeal to the Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the complainant is required to submit the statement of fees and costs supported by affidavit to the agency within 30 days of its decision, in <span class="Italic">Lovett v. Hagel</span>, 0120122662 (2013), the Commission accepted attorney's affidavit submitted on appeal. The decision is short on facts but it appears the attorney was unfamiliar with federal sector procedures, did submit a statement of fees and costs with a letter generally describing his practice and the agency did not advise him the fee petition was deficient prior to issuing a final agency decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The confusion caused by Part 1614 and MD-110 should, in any event, be clarified by the instructions in the decision, whether issued by an administrative judge or an agency. Any decision with a finding of discrimination, whether issued by an administrative judge or an agency, should include a notice of the complainant's entitlement to attorney fees and costs. As a result, the decision should inform the complainant of the procedure to follow and the proper time frame for filing a request.</p>
<p class="noindent">In practice, when an administrative judge issues a finding of discrimination, he or she will also issue a decision on remedies for the complainant and, ultimately, a decision on attorney fees. Pursuant to the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, at 8-1, decisions that "trigger an agency's obligation to take final action and permit parties to file an appeal are decisions concluding all phases of the hearing process...." An award of attorney fees to a prevailing party is simply one phase, albeit the last, of the hearing process. That same section of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> also provides that the administrative judge "clearly state whether and when his/her decision triggers appeal rights...." The practical process makes far more sense than the remand provision of the Commission's regulations. The process is already sufficiently time-consuming without a needless remand.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission, an administrative judge or an agency issues a decision with a finding of discrimination, the decision is required to contain the "appropriate remedies," including an entitlement to attorney fees. Failure to include such a notice can lead to a waiver of the time period for filing a statement of fees and costs. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120102121 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">The importance of keeping contemporaneous time sheets in EEO cases cannot be stressed enough. Time sheets should include, at a minimum, the date on which services were performed, a description of the services performed, and the amount of time it took to perform the services. The description of the services performed need not be lengthy but should be in sufficient detail to justify the work performed and the time spent, in the event questions arise. Merely noting that one hour was spent in a conference with a client may not be sufficient. The time sheet should at least generally identify the matter or matters discussed with the client during that conference. For example, the attorney may want to make a notation such as the following: "Conference with client to discuss case status, settlement negotiations, pending discovery responses." In this manner, enough information is given about the nature of the conference to give the agency or the Commission some means of determining whether it was reasonable to spend an hour in conference with the client at that point in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are several computer programs to assist attorneys in keeping contemporaneous time records of their work. Ultimately, these programs can render a printout of all services performed on behalf of a particular client. Because EEO cases can span several years, these programs provide an easy and space-saving method of keeping time records on numerous clients for a long period of time. For any attorney whose livelihood depends on the keeping of detailed time records, such a program is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The request for attorney fees should be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney that recounts his or her experience. Also, if the Commission or any federal agency has previously approved the hourly rate being sought, this information should be included in the fee request. As discussed more fully below, such information is useful in establishing the attorney's customary hourly rate--a critical factor in any fee request. Copies of the actual time records should be attached to the affidavit. In some instances, the attorney may also be required to submit supporting affidavits from other practitioners on the reasonableness of the hourly rate charged.</p>
<p class="noindent">Written retainer agreements, though not required, also are a good idea. If a written retainer agreement, specifying an hourly rate, has been executed with the client, this should be included with the fee request. Although such an agreement is not binding on the agency, it will generally constitute <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of the reasonable hourly rate.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that the complainant file a detailed fee petition containing lengthy argument about entitlement to fees. To those familiar with fee petitions before the Merit Systems Protection Board, this represents a substantial difference. The statutory entitlement to fees in cases before the MSPB requires the employee to show that an award of fees would be in the interests of justice. Often, this requires lengthy legal argument under the various criteria developed by the Board defining the interests of justice standard. By contrast, entitlement to fees under the antidiscrimination statutes arises simply by virtue of being the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency or an administrative judge has 60 days from submission to issue a decision on attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(A). When a fee request is filed with the administrative judge, the agency has 30 days from filing to respond to the request. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 11-9. A final decision on an award of attorney fees may be appealed to OFO just as any other final agency decision. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span>; 29 CFR 1614.401(a)-(b). The notice of appeal must be filed with OFO within 30 days of receipt of the final agency action on attorney fees; the appealing party then has an additional 30 days to file a brief in support of that appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant contends that a postage meter mark may be in error and an application for attorney fees was timely filed, she must do more than submit an affidavit from counsel stating he placed it in a mailbox on the appropriate date. The mere assertion of counsel that it was his understanding the postage meter at his office sometimes malfunctioned was not sufficient without additional evidence in the form of a sworn statement by someone with personal knowledge of the faulty mechanism. Moreover, while the attorney asserted he placed it in a mailbox after 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on the due date, he made no representations as to whether mail was picked up from that box after 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paulk v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05940066 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, however, can be somewhat forgiving when it comes to untimely filed fee petitions. In <span class="Italic">Thomas-Madison v. Attorney General</span>, 0720100053 (2011), for reasons that do not appear in the record, the complainant's attorney failed to file a fee petition with the administrative judge though clearly advised to do so and of the time frame for doing so. The agency appealed the finding of discrimination and the complainant filed no appeal. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Oest</span>, found that the complainant was not entitled to a fee decision by the administrative judge, but ordered the agency to address the issue of fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant did not file an appeal of the Agency's final order in order to challenge any aspect of the AJ's decision. Complainant did file a brief in response to the Agency's appeal, making the argument that the only appropriate time for her to file a petition for fees would be after the Commission decides this appeal. This position is inconsistent with the Commission's policy and precedent and clearly inconsistent with the AJ's guidance from the bench.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot ascertain from the record why Complainant did not submit a verified statement of attorney's fees or costs to the AJ. As a consequence of that failure, we find Complainant waived her right to have the fee petition decided by an AJ. However, we note that the AJ did not affirmatively decline to award fees but only noted the absence of a verified fee petition. Under these circumstances, Complainant must submit her fee petition to the Agency consistent with the Order below.</p>
