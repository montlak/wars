<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-12"><span class="space">4.</span> Notification of Personnel Action</h4>
<p class="noindent">The effective date of the personnel action does not start the limitations period when the employee is not notified of the action until after its effective date and is otherwise unaware of the action. <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01841179 (1985). It is important to note, however, that there is no requirement that an agency personally notify each unsuccessful applicant for a position. Many agencies do not. Rather, selections are posted in a central location. A potential complainant cannot indefinitely extend the time period for initiating counseling simply by making no effort to determine if the position has been filled. See the later discussion on "<a href="0100-2023-11-015.html#sec2-16">Tolling the Period for Counseling</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">When the employee is not officially "notified" that a personnel action has become effective, "[t]he focus is on what event, in fairness and logic, should have alerted the average layperson to act to protect his rights, or when he should have perceived that discrimination was occurring." <span class="Italic">Connor v. Department of Army</span>, 01830913 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Sperry-Rand Corp.</span>, 79 FRD 580, 21 FEP 677 (D. Minn. 1978)). In <span class="Italic">Connor</span>, the EEOC found that an applicant who allegedly was not selected due to a hiring freeze should have been on notice of possible discrimination when she learned that the agency filled the position, the selectee was far less qualified, and the selectee was living with the selecting official.</p>
<p class="noindent">With little explanation, the Commission held that dismissal for untimely EEO counselor contact was improper where there was no evidence that the agency <span id="Page_40"></span>gave the complainant notice that a selection was made. <span class="Italic">Valerio v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01964454 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Valerio</span>, the Commission simply noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant does not argue that he was unaware of the time limits for contacting a counselor. Appellant contends that he was not notified by the agency of its selection decision. Therefore, there was no date from which the time period began to run. The record supports appellant's contention regarding the agency's failure to give him written notice of his nonselection. There is nothing in the record which would establish the date of the selection decision, or how or when appellant actually became aware of his nonselection. Therefore, the agency improperly dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to contact an EEO Counselor in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is unlikely the Commission intended <span class="Italic">Valerio</span> to impose a written notice requirement. Rather, it is more likely that the Commission observed there was no specific evidence to conclusively show when the complainant learned that the job was filled and it accepted his representation that he did not find out until sometime later, since no written notification of the selection was given.</p>
<p class="noindent">Being eliminated from consideration for a position does not start the time period for counselor contact. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cargill v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01963122 (1996), the Commission held that although the complainant knew that she had not made the best-qualified list prior to the selection, the time frame for contacting an EEO counselor did not start until the actual selection was made. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Elliott D. v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 0120161480 (2016) (45-day period commenced on the effective date that the selectee was chosen for the subject position, not from the time that the complainant learned that his application had not been submitted due to an error in the questionnaire that accompanied his application or when the complainant's supervisor advised him that his name did not appear on the referral list of candidates for the position).</p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed more fully below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-11-020.html#sec2-21">Reasonable Suspicion Standard</a>," mere knowledge of the personnel action may not be sufficient to begin the running of the time period when the employee lacks knowledge of the particulars surrounding the action. The Commission has held that the time to contact an EEO counselor for a nonselection does not necessarily begin to run when the appellant learns of the nonselection. In <span class="Italic">Howard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965268 (1997), the appellant stated that he was not told the identity of the selectee, only that he was not selected, and the record did not show that appellant learned who was selected prior to viewing a roster. The Commission found that, in the absence of definitive evidence to the contrary, appellant's EEO contact was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unofficial advance notice of an employee's nonselection does not begin the running of the time period for EEO contact. In <span class="Italic">Emerson P. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120162817 (2017), prior to announcing a selectee, the complainant's regional directors told him that he would not be selected for the position. They also identified the most likely selectee to the complainant during the same meeting. The complainant waited to file an EEO complaint until after the official announcement. The agency dismissed his complaint for untimely counselor contact, noting that the complainant was obligated to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of the date his regional directors told him that he would not be selected for the position. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Emerson P</span>. disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 29, 2016, Complainant received unofficial advance notice from his regional leadership that he likely would not be selected for the PAC at the Oakland RO. The ASAC and SAC also informed Complainant who the Agency would select in lieu of him to a "ninety-percent degree" of certainty. This, however, was not official notification of his non-selection. At that point, we find that there was still a possibility that the Selectee might not have either been selected or accepted the RAC position in Oakland. From the Agency's record, it is also unclear whether the non-selection discussion conversation involving the ASAC, SAC and Complainant, definitively advised him whether the Agency would make a job announcement wherein he could apply to fill the RAC vacancy. After all, the ASAC had, at one point, advised Complainant to prepare his resume for such an opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hence, the circumstances of this case support the Complainant's position that his claim of discrimination did not become reasonably apparent until May 2016, when Complainant was officially informed that the Selectee's transfer to the Oakland RAC position had been approved and her start date was announced. Prior to the ASAC's email of May 5, 2016, it was reasonable for Complainant to think that he still had a ten-percent chance of remaining in his acting RAC slot. However, after the ASAC's email, Complainant had official notice that Selectee would replace him and serve as the permanent RAC with an effective date of May 15, 2016. Only then did all the facts to support a claim of discrimination become apparent to the Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Arnaldo P. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120161967 (September 14, 2016) (while the complainant "had some unofficial notice that he might not be selected, the decision not to select him did not become effective until the Agency issued its disposition notice..."). Accordingly, the trigger-date for the 45-day EEO counselor contact began on May 5, 2016, not on March 29, 2016 as the Agency contends. Therefore, we find that the Complainant's EEO Counselor contact on May 17, 2016, was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the agency bears the burden of proving that its decision to dismiss a claim for untimely counselor contact is correct, the agency must include sufficient information about both the effective date of a personnel action, and when the employee was informed of the action, to permit the Commission to review the agency's determination. In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A14654 (2002), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint over a suspension because the record contained insufficient evidence to determine the effective date of the suspension and when the employee had been informed of the suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Karchin v. Defense Investigative Service</span>, 01830083 (1983), the employee was notified only of his nonselection for a position but given no information about who was selected. The agency subsequently delayed its response to a FOIA request on the selected candidate. The EEOC ruled the time limit for counselor contact did not begin to run until the employee received the FOIA response that provided the factual basis for the employee's belief that discrimination was a factor in his nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Nevels v. Attorney General</span>, 01A01116 (2000), the Commission found insufficient basis for waiving the time limit for counselor contact when the complainant alleged that several positions were filled and she was informed that, if any of the selectees declined, a position could open up for her. The Commission found that the complainant should have contacted a counselor when she first learned of her nonselection and not several months later when the last selectees accepted.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, when an employee is given a second chance and the personnel action is made contingent on the outcome of that chance, the time period does not begin to run until the contingency becomes reality. <span class="Italic">Clinkscales v. USPS</span>, 01830746 (1983). In that case, decided under the 30-day standard, the appellant contacted the counselor 36 days after the effective date of her removal for failure to pass a qualifying examination for her position. However, the agency also informed the employee that she would be allowed to report for additional training and to take the exam a second time. If appellant passed the exam, her removal would have been canceled. The fact that she contacted a counselor within 30 days of her second failure to pass the exam was timely. Likewise, while a complainant cannot cure a timeliness defect by asking the agency to reconsider its position and then initiating counselor contact within 45 days of its subsequent denial, this does not prevent him from challenging an agency refusal to take further similar actions based on changed circumstances. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kovaian v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963538 (1997), the Commission held that it was error for the agency to dismiss an allegation of denial of a schedule change for untimely counselor contact based upon a letter it previously sent to the appellant stating that it would not make schedule changes for him. The Commission found that the earlier denial of a schedule change did not preclude the complainant from challenging the later denial where the second request was supported by a letter from the complainant's physician.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some agencies carry employees in a nonpay, nonduty status pending the appeal of a termination so the employee will continue to be eligible for benefits during the appeal period. Even though still technically an employee of the agency, the time period begins to run with the effective date of the personnel action cited in the notice of termination. <span class="Italic">Liberato v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971024 (1998); <span class="Italic">Givens v. USPS</span>, 01841236 (1985). But, if the agency gives conflicting information about the personnel action, this may prevent the 45-day period from starting. In <span class="Italic">Beck v. Postmaster General</span>, 001A12413 (2002), the agency sent the complainant a letter in December 1998 terminating her employment, but the complainant did not receive an SF-50 until October 2002. Until that time, she continued to receive pay stubs designating her status as leave without pay. The Commission found the time period for counselor contact did not begin to run until receipt of the SF-50.</p>
<p class="noindent">On performance evaluations, the time period begins to run when the employee actually receives an official copy of the rating<span class="Italic">. In re Smith</span>, 05870178 (1987). Until that time, the rating is subject to change or amendment by higher level officials. The same rationale has been applied to agency determinations on medical suitability where an appeal process is available. Until the appeal is complete, the agency is free to reverse its determination and make an offer of employment. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 01861229 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a letter of reprimand is placed in an employee's personnel file for a two-year period does not mean that the employee may initiate a complaint at any time during that period. The counselor must be contacted within 45 days of the date the reprimand was issued. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Navy</span>, 01830142 (1983) (decided under the 30-day standard).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee instructs an agency to deliver any notice of a personnel action to his attorney, the time period for initiating counseling begins to run when the attorney receives the notice. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950801 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">The date designated by the employee as to when the incident of discrimination occurred is not controlling when the facts demonstrate that another date should be used. In <span class="Italic">Villamil v. USPS</span>, 01831858 (1983), the appellant designated the date of an on-the-job accident as the date of the latest incident of <span id="Page_41"></span>discrimination. However, from the appellant's complaint and the EEO counselor's report, it was apparent that the matter at issue was the agency's failure to provide the employee with a copy of the accident report--an event that occurred some four months later and within the 30-day time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120130537 (2014), the Commission found counselor contact was timely where the employee was informed that she had been terminated but was not given an SF-50 with an effective date and the record did not contain a copy of the separation notice or the SF-50.</p>
