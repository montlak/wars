<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-24"><span class="space">1.</span> Requirements of Direct Threat Defense</h4>
<p class="noindent">When an agency asserts that it has no obligation to offer accommodation because the employee poses a threat to himself or others, that assertion "must be 'supported by evidence adequate to establish the direct connection between the particular job qualifications applied and the considerations of business necessity and safe performance that the Act requires.'" <span class="Italic">Metza v. USPS</span>, 01862348 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Bentivegna v. U.S. Department of Labor</span>, 694 F.2d 619 (9th Cir. 1982)). The Commission, relying upon <span class="Italic">Bentivegna</span>, noted that such evidence must be carefully scrutinized "if the Rehabilitation Act is not to be circumvented easily, since almost all handicapped persons are at greater risks...."</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden is on the agency to gather sufficient evidence to establish that the employee is a direct threat to herself or others. <span class="Italic">Selix v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970153 (2000). The agency's judgment cannot be based on a subjective evaluation, but must be based upon substantial evidence and an <span id="Page_1286"></span>individualized assessment of the risk. In <span class="Italic">Selix</span>, the Commission held that it was error for the agency's physician to base an assessment of moderate risk solely on the complainant's past record of disability. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Tyson A. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2020000972 (2021) ("theoretical and speculative [safety] concerns" will not relieve the agency of the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency fears, based on conjecture and speculation, rather than sound medical evidence do not constitute a showing of a reasonable probability of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01873389 (1988). "Such a determination cannot be based merely on the agency's subjective evaluation or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports." <span class="Italic">Manuel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871230 (1988). The agency must "independently assess both the probability and severity of potential injury." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Manuel</span>, the Commission rejected the testimony of an agency medical officer that, "as a rule," persons with injuries like the complainant's could pose a risk of self-injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">In applying the standard set down in <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416 (9th Cir. 1985), the "agency must consider whether, in light of the individual's work and medical history, employment of that individual would pose a reasonable probability of substantial harm." <span class="Italic">Andress v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880706 (1988). This requires a "careful, studied analysis of appellant's actual performance and physical condition." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also</span> <span class="Italic">Egresi v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081555 (2012) (ban on open-toed orthopedic shoe not based on individualized assessment of probability of harm); <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01952672 (1997) (accommodation for an overtime work assignment did not pose an undue burden where the agency had accommodated the employee on other overtime assignments and introduced no evidence reflecting an individualized assessment of the specific assignment at issue).</p>
<p class="noindent">Merely showing a "greater chance" of future injury to the employee does not satisfy the <span class="Italic">Mantolete</span> standard of "a reasonable probability of substantial harm...." <span class="Italic">DiMiceli v. Postmaster General</span>, 05900709 (1990). The fact that the appellant in <span class="Italic">DiMiceli</span> had a somewhat greater chance of developing arthritis due to his disability could not sustain the agency's burden<span class="Italic">.</span> Moreover, when an agency disqualifies every potential employee who is categorized as a moderate risk, without performing an individualized assessment, this constitutes a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laughlin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953571 (1997). Without specifically discussing the direct threat defense, in <span class="Italic">Matilde M. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120140147 (2017), the Commission found that the agency failed to support its contention that coworkers were concerned that the crown of thorns that complainant kept on her desk could be used as a dangerous weapon and that her mental disability left her "unstable." Noting that the agency did not provide any coworker statements to that effect, the Commission concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find based on the record before us that S3 had no more reason to believe that Complainant would become violent than any other employee would. Rather, S3's decision appears grounded in stereotypes about people with mental illnesses. We note that the Rehabilitation Act is designed to protect against unsupported myths, fears, stereotypes, and other attitudinal barriers about disability, which include, but are not limited to, concerns about productivity, safety, insurance, liability, attendance, cost of accommodation and accessibility, and acceptance by coworkers and customers. <span class="Italic">See Bonenberger v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111259 (Aug. 13, 2013). Here, the Agency conceded that it directed Complainant to remove the Crown based on alleged perceptions by coworkers which directly related to Complainant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the record does not support a finding that the Agency's instruction that Complainant remove the Crown resulted from any factor other than the Agency's wholly unsubstantiated perception that Complainant might use the Crown as a weapon.</p>
<p class="noindent">The assessment of whether a disabled employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm must be supported by specific evidence and must take into account possible accommodations that could be provided. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01954604 (1998), the Commission found that the agency did not adequately support its contention that the complainant posed a significant risk, in part because the agency's conclusion rested on invalid assumptions about the complainant's work conditions. The assessment also failed to take into account several accommodation devices that were available to assist the complainant--a hearing-impaired forklift operator. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, reversed the agency's finding that the employee posed a significant risk:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the evidence of record, the Commission finds that it is presently inadequate to demonstrate whether appellant's hearing impairment presents a significant risk of substantial harm to himself or others. The agency indicates that it determined that a waiver of the hearing requirement for driving a five-ton truck or forklift was not appropriate in appellant's case because of the safety risk posed by appellant's delivery of heavy materials to areas on a military base in which dependents were housed. Notwithstanding our assessment that the potential harm noted by the agency could be severe if an accident involving dependents or other workers were to occur, we are not persuaded that the record is adequate to indicate whether appellant's operation of the subject equipment would result in a significant risk that the cited harm would occur.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arriving at this assessment, we note several deficiencies in the evidence presented by the agency to support its conclusions. First, we find the simulation "test" the Chief relied upon to initially deny appellant's waiver request to be insufficient on its own to prove that appellant's operation of a forklift or five-ton truck would pose an unacceptable safety risk. Frankly, we do not understand how appellant's response to commands shouted at him from a distance while his back is turned can be an accurate indicator of how he would react in a situation where mirrors, flashing lights, pagers, etc., would be available to assist him, and in which appellant would presumably have at least some opportunity to view a guide's gestures, before proceeding further. The agency's apparent assumptions that appellant would be presented with situations in which none of these assistive devices would be available and that he would move without first availing himself of any possible visual access, are not sufficiently explained in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we note that the agency presented no evidence which would indicate the relative likelihood of the occurrence of the specific hazardous circumstances cited by the agency, e.g., children running in the area of appellant's deliveries, and appellant's complete inability to see a ground guide on any given delivery occasion. There is no indication whether the agency officials herein visited the specific delivery sites to ascertain the actual proximity of dependents to the delivery areas and to determine whether measures could be taken to reduce the risk of such accidents. The agency presents no information concerning the past frequency of such incidents on the delivery route that appellant would be assigned. The agency further fails to provide a clear explanation of the basis for its assessment that there would be no direct line of sight for appellant in the subject delivery areas or specific reasoning which would indicate why the medical staff utterly discounted suggested potential accommodations to reduce the alleged safety risk through the use of mirrors mounted on machinery and in delivery areas, flashing lights, signaling devices and/or paging systems. The agency does not indicate whether the provision of any of these suggested accommodations would impose an undue hardship on its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, while the agency has indicated that appellant's hearing would be further degraded by his use of hearing aids, it presents insufficient evidence to establish the validity of this assessment. The Commission requires that any assessment that a high probability exists of substantial harm to an individual must be based strictly on valid medical analysis and/or on other objective evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appendix, Section 1630(r). In this case, the agency furnishes insufficient analysis or evidence to support its assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> requires the agency to assess the probability of the risk involved even where the consequences of the ensuing harm are great.</p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating the risk to the complainant or others, it is not relevant that coworkers find the effects of the disability unpleasant. In <span class="Italic">Fellows-Gilder v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A33476 (2005), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that there are three stages of these dissociative episodes. First, she has an aura which is a warning, her head is bobbing, and she has a headache. In the second stage, she starts to slur and stutter (an indication that something strong is coming); and the final stage, when she feels that she needs to get to the floor because she "is going to have something that mimics a grand mal." Complainant testified that she is perfectly conscious and capable of getting to the floor, and stated that she does not fall to the floor. The hearing transcript reveals that complainant's first line supervisor testified that he witnessed one of complainant's seizures and did not see complainant experience any harm because of the seizure. When he was asked about whether there "would be any risk to her [complainant] based on the trashing that you saw?"--he just answered, "I don't know how to answer--based on what I saw?...I don't know how slight or how much it takes, I'm not in a position to, to make that determination..." We find, therefore, that management determined that complainant posed a direct threat based on the subjective evaluation of complainant's supervisors, not based on an individualized assessment of complainant's condition and in direct contradiction of the medical evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, after careful review of the hearing transcript, the Commission concludes that the agency was motivated by a concern for the way that co-workers reacted to the seizure-episodes. Specifically, the agency argued that because of complainant's seizures, some employees stop their work to sit with her, and some employees leave because they are uncomfortable, and that affects the agency's productivity. However, the record shows that complainant never requested any help and that she handled her seizure-episodes by herself. Moreover, nothing in the record shows that either the agency's productivity or its quality was affected by complainant's seizures. We conclude that complainant is not responsible <span id="Page_1287"></span>for the reactions of her co-workers or for other employees leaving their work area without authorization. That is a matter which should be handled by management officials, who should implement, if necessary, the proper procedures to remedy that situation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant may need further corrective surgery in the future does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> establish that he or she is a substantial risk. In <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/07A20117.txt">07A20117</a> (2003), the Commission also found that the agency regarded the complainant's knee injury was a substantially limiting disability because it considered him only to be qualified for sedentary work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Perez</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the medical evidence in the record, the Commission finds that complainant was not an individual with a disability under the first or second prong of the definition pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act because the record does not support a finding that complainant's knee condition substantially limited any of his major life activities or that he had a record of such. However, the Commission agrees with the Administrative Judge that the agency regarded complainant as having an impairment which substantially limited complainant's ability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency regards an individual as substantially limited in a major life activity when it concludes that the individual has an impairment that significantly restricts him or her from currently performing a major life activity, even though the individual's impairment does not in fact substantially limit his/her ability to perform a major life activity; the impairment is only substantially limiting only as a result of the attitude of others; or the individual has no impairment. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(1). To be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, an individual must be regarded as having an impairment that significantly restricts him or her from currently performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(3). We find that complainant has shown that he could perform the essential functions of the position at issue but that the agency perceived him as only being able to work in a sedentary capacity. We thus conclude that the agency regarded complainant as having an impairment which substantially limited his ability to work in a broad range of jobs in various classes requiring non-sedentary work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the agency's argument that this finding automatically entitles every applicant for employment, who is found medically unsuitable for a position, to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. Rather, every determination as to whether an applicant or employee is an individual with a disability within the meaning of Rehabilitation Act is made on a case by case basis<span class="Italic">. See Bragdon v. Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624 (1998). In this case, the record clearly supports a finding that complainant had an impairment which was not substantially limiting but was perceived to be by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant must next show that he is a "qualified individual with a disability." 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(m). A "qualified individual with a disability" is an individual who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> For the reasons set forth by the Administrative Judge, we find that complainant has established that he is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found, based upon his pre-existing knee condition, that complainant posed a direct threat of future injury to himself and was therefore unsuitable for employment. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r). In order to exclude an individual on the basis of possible future injury, the agency bears the burden of showing there is a significant risk, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> high probability of substantial harm. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. The agency must show more than that an individual with a disability seeking employment stands some slightly increased risk of harm<span class="Italic">. Selix v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Moreover, such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r). A determination of significant risk cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. Rather, the agency must gather and base its decision on substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical histories<span class="Italic">. Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1422-1423 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we agree with the Administrative Judge's finding that the agency failed to show a significant risk, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> high probability of substantial harm. The Administrative Judge found that while both the area medical director and the orthopaedist agreed that it was likely complainant would re-injure his knee, neither physician predicted, with any degree of certainty, when the re-injury was likely to occur or how severe the resulting harm would be. She further found that both physicians agreed that the re-injury was not expected to occur within the first six months. The Administrative Judge also found that although the area medical director testified that complainant's knee problems might include steady degeneration of the joint and that the chances of successful surgery decrease with each subsequent surgery, the area medical doctor rated complainant as a low risk/restriction. These factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency argues that "the prospect that an employee would have to undergo surgery is a substantial risk. Surgery is not something to be taken lightly." The agency also argues that the duration of the risk was permanent in that complainant's knee problem was "not going to go away." It is clear from the record that in denying complainant employment, the agency believed that complainant was likely to incur further injury to his knee because of the residual instability caused by the previous injury and subsequent surgeries. While we agree with the agency that complainant's knee would always be at some risk for re-injury and that surgery "is not something to be taken lightly," we agree with the Administrative Judge that the assessment and testimony of the orthopaedist and the area medical director were too speculative concerning the nature and severity of the harm complainant would sustain and too remote concerning when complainant could be expected to sustain such harm to prove that complainant posed a direct threat. We therefore conclude that the agency's denial of employment to complainant was in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">A good example of the proper evaluation to conduct in a direct threat case is provided by <span class="Italic">Evans v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064100 (2008), where the agency withdrew a conditional offer of employment for a rural carrier position where a subsequent medical inquiry determined that the complaint had both knee and back problems. The case not only provides a good example of the proper evaluation to conduct, but also of the proper use of medical inquiries based on a conditional offer of employment. In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, the Commission upheld the agency's finding that the complainant posed a substantial risk to himself, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the agency officials stated as follows concerning the medical assessment that was conducted of complainant: during the assessment process, complainant completed an eighty-question electronic questionnaire. In response to certain questions, complainant explained that he had a 10 percent veteran's disability rating on each knee for patello-femoral syndrome and a 10 percent rating for lumbosacral strain. He also stated that he was treated at a veteran's medical center for his knee and back condition with an anti-inflammatory medication. The Occupational Nurse (ON) testified that the Postal Service's Electronic Mail-Medical Assessment Program (EMAP) flagged the information concerning complainant's knees and back as a basis for further investigation. In a follow-up interview with the ON, complainant stated that he experienced pain <span id="Page_1288"></span>in his left shoulder, back, and knees, and took an anti-inflammatory medication. He said that the onset of the condition for his knees and back was May 2000, and that he had last been "seen" at the veteran's medical center within the previous couple of weeks. Complainant told the ON that during the past year he had worked as a recreational aide and had performed administrative work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency further related that based on complainant's responses to the interview questions, the ON determined that the Postal Service needed more information concerning his physical ability to perform the job of Rural Carrier Associate. As a result, she referred the matter to someone with more medical expertise (the Occupational Health Nurse Administrator), who then asked an Orthopedic Specialist (OS), to conduct a focused physical examination with reference to complainant's history of lumbosacral strain in his back and patella-femoral syndrome in both knees. In a report dated December 2, 2004, the OS reported the results of his examination to the District Medical Director (DMD), who testified that complainant would be considered a high risk for medical reasons. The medical unit thereafter determined that complainant was in the high risk category, and was not medically qualified to perform the functions of the position, and reported that determination to the District Human Resources Office. The District sent the medical determination to the Area Medical Director (AMD), who testified, "I went over the medical evaluations that we had. All the subjective and objective information that we had. And the very recent objective and the subjective exam by a specialist in the field, who gave me the information." AMD concurred that complainant would be at risk for performing duties of a Rural Carrier, and testified that the physical requirements of the position would aggravate his pre-existing conditions. Because complainant was a preference eligible veteran with a 30 percent or more veteran's disability rating, the Postal Service was required to send its determination to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for review. AMD testified that OPM reviewed the file and concurred with the Postal Service's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's finding that the Postal Service properly concluded, after conducting an individualized assessment, that there would be a high probability of substantial risk if complainant were hired, is supported by substantial evidence in this record. In so finding, we note that complainant himself asserts that he was currently experiencing pain in his left shoulder, back, and knees, and took an anti-inflammatory medication, and that he had been "seen" for his permanent conditions of bilateral patello-femoral syndrome and lumbosacral strain at the veteran's medical center within the previous couple of weeks. <span class="Italic">See</span> Report of Investigation (ROI), Exhibit 4, at 3. This is distinguishable from another similar case, <span class="Italic">Gaynor v. United State s Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A33909 (June 1, 2006), in which the Commission found that the agency improperly determined that complainant was unsuitable for employment in spite of the fact that the contract physician had found that complainant currently had "no acute problems," and complainant's private physicians' physical examinations indicated that complainant had no current physical limitations or restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, AMD testified that the "most accepted theory" with reference to patella-femoral syndrome is that it is "a malalignment in the way the kneecap moves with the bottom part of the upper leg bone." AMD testified that the bending, climbing and lifting requirements of the position could cause pain so severe that it could cause complainant to fall. He also testified that bending, twisting, or side bending could exacerbate complainant's lumbosacral strain. These facts differ from those in <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120054928 (June 27, 2007), where we found that the agency's determination that complainant posed a risk of injury if required to stand for more than eight hours a day was made without the identification of any specific injury that complainant was supposedly susceptible to, other than a generalized risk or fear of injury in the next six months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is also distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A45134 (June 1, 2006), where the Commission found that the agency determined, without first performing any medical tests, that complainant would have difficulty if performing the duties of the position on a day-to-day basis. In the instant case, the Orthopedic Specialist conducted a focused physical examination with reference to complainant's history of lumbosacral strain in his back and patello-femoral syndrome in both knees. In addition, in Brown, the Commission declined to find that a notation of "moderate risk" by the Medical Officer (who did not personally examine complainant) was sufficient for a showing of a "significant risk of substantial harm" as required by the regulations. Here, however, when the agency Counsel asked AMD at the hearing whether in his expert opinion it was a medical certainty that complainant would have injured himself as a Rural Carrier Associate, AMD answered, "My impression is, yes. Definitely." In addition, the District Medical Director testified that complainant would be considered a high risk for medical reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the AJ's conclusion that complainant was not "qualified" for the position because of posing a direct threat, is supported by substantial evidence in the record. As complainant has not demonstrated that he is entitled to coverage under the Rehabilitation Act, he cannot prevail in this case. Accordingly, based on a thorough review of the record and the contentions on appeal, including those not specifically addressed herein, we AFFIRM the final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mardis v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072656 (2011), the Commission upheld the agency's determination that the complainant was medically unfit to be a mail processing clerk based on an individualized analysis of both the potential harm and the likelihood of harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency made its decision to find Complainant medically unsuitable for employment based on the Orthopedist's report and recommendation, which were produced based on Complainant's medical and work histories as well as physical and X-ray examinations conducted by the Orthopedist. The report indicated three medical conditions, namely, that Complainant had poor longitudinal arches, a fragment in his right wrist, and a narrowed L5-S1 spinal disc space with anterior spurs. <span class="Italic">See</span> Orthopedist's Report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Medical Director stated that Complainant's disc problem, which was located in the lower part of his back, is the area that is most impacted when one is performing heavy lifting or bending or standing for long periods of time. According to her, by performing such activities, Complainant would be constantly aggravating that region. The Medical Director indicated that such aggravation could result in Complainant experiencing progression of his disease and disc herniation, which would lead to problems ranging from back pain radiating down to his legs and difficulty in urination and defecation, to paralysis of his legs, depending on the severity of the herniation. She also indicated that the potential risk, which she described as life-long, could arise the first time Complainant lifts something or bends down or twists, or anytime afterward. The Medical Director then opined that Complainant had a 90 percent or more chance of incurring such an event than a person who has no history of such conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's medical unsuitability determination was explained in sufficient detail, addressed the duration of the risk posed by Complainant's medical conditions, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. We therefore find that the Agency has met its burden of showing that hiring Complainant into the Distribution Clerk craft would have resulted in a high probability of substantial harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency improperly concludes that a disabled employee presents a risk, appropriate relief includes expunging the files of risk notations. <span class="Italic">Buchanan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924009 (1993).</p>
