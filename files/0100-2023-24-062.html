<h2 class="h2" id="sec15-45"><span class="space">IV.</span> FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although the ADA and FMLA are two distinct statutes and separately enforced--FMLA is enforced by the Department of Labor for Title I employees and the Office of Personnel Management for Title II employees--there is some overlap between the two. The purpose of this discussion is not to give a full accounting of FMLA, but to cover those areas where FMLA can impact on reasonable accommodation under the ADA. Relevant to the ADA, FMLA provides or up to 12 weeks of leave for an employee suffering from a "serious health condition." FMLA also provides for leave benefits for serious health conditions and other circumstances affecting the family of the employee, as well as leave for caregivers of military family members and exigency leave for military purposes. However, none of those benefits under FMLA impact upon an agency's ADA obligations. For a full discussion of FMLA, the reader is referred to <span class="Italic">A Guide to FMLA and Related Litigation</span>, Carl C. Bosland (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/23FMLA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023).</p>
<p class="noindent">As it does in many other areas, the EEOC has published a factsheet entitled "The Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964," which is available on the Commission's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>. Although most of the intersection with FMLA and the civil rights statutes is under the ADA, there are some Title VII implications with regard to pregnant employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is quite possible that an employee will satisfy the definition of an individual with a disability under the ADA and also have a serious health condition under FMLA. One of the significant differences in the statutes is that FMLA has no undue hardship defense. If an employee is entitled to leave under FMLA, the agency must grant that leave even if under and ADA analysis the leave would constitute an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another consideration is that, under the FMLA, an employee utilizing a modified schedule still retains the benefits he or she received prior to the modification. If an employee moves to a part-time schedule as an accommodation under the ADA, the employee is entitled only to the benefits received by similarly situated part-time employees. The Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> [Research Supp. G, p. 364], provides a comparison between the ADA and the FMLA regarding requests for schedule modification, and an example:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the ADA, an employee who needs a modified or part-time schedule because of his/her disability is entitled to such a schedule if there is no other effective accommodation and it will not cause undue hardship. If there is undue hardship, the employer must reassign the employee if there is a vacant position for which s/he is qualified and which would allow the employer to grant the modified or part-time schedule (absent undue hardship). An employee receiving a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation is entitled only to the benefits, including health insurance, that other part-time employees receive. Thus, if non-disabled part-time workers are not provided with health insurance, then the employer does not have to provide such coverage to an employee with a disability who is given a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FMLA, an eligible employee is entitled to take leave intermittently or on a part-time basis, when medically necessary, until s/he has used up the equivalent of 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. When such leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, an employer may require the employee to temporarily transfer (for the duration of the leave) to an available alternative position, with equivalent pay and benefits, for which the employee is qualified and which better suits his/her reduced hours. An employer always must maintain the employee's existing level of coverage under a group health plan during the period of FMLA leave, provided the employee pays his/her share of the premium.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example</span>: An employee with an ADA disability requests that she be excused from work one day a week for the next six months because of her disability. If this employee is eligible for a modified schedule under the FMLA, the employer must provide the requested leave under that statute if it is medically necessary, even if the leave would be an undue hardship under the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">A request for FMLA leave for a serious health condition may also constitute a request for reasonable accommodation and, when it does, the FMLA request is considered protected EEO activity. For example in <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093843 (2011), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant has shown that he engaged in a protected activity and that the Agency was aware of the protected activity. Specifically, the record reflects that Complainant submitted FMLA paperwork, which constituted a request for reasonable accommodation, to S2. A request for reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes protected activity under Section 503 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). EEOC Compliance Manual Section 8, "Retaliation," No. 915.003, at 8-II.B.2. (May 20, 1998). Although a person making such a request might not literally "oppose" discrimination or "participate" in the administrative complaint process, he is protected against retaliation for making the request. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Because an employee may be an individual with a disability under the ADA and have a serious health condition under FMLA, the employee may actually be entitled to leave under both statutes. However, the leave is overlapping. The employee may be entitled to 12 weeks leave under FMLA and, if that is all the leave required by the employee, an agency fulfills its obligation under both statutes by granting FMLA leave. If the employee needs leave beyond the 12 weeks, the agency must then grant the leave if it would not impose an undue hardship on the agency. In such cases, the impact on the agency of the first 12 weeks of leave take pursuant to the FMLA can be considered in determining whether granting additional time as a reasonable accommodation would be an undue hardship. The Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, describes the differences between the use of leave under the ADA and the FMLA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Under the ADA</span>, an employee who needs leave related to his/her disability is entitled to such leave if there is no other effective accommodation and the leave will not cause undue hardship. An employer must allow the individual to use any accrued paid leave first, but, if that is insufficient to cover the entire period, then the employer should grant unpaid leave. An employer must continue an employee's health insurance benefits during his/her leave period only if it does so for other employees in a similar leave status. As for the employee's position, the ADA requires that the employer hold it open while the employee is on leave unless it can show that doing so causes undue hardship. When the employee is ready to return to work, the employer must allow the individual to return to the same position (assuming that there was no undue hardship in holding it open) if the employee is still qualified (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the employee can perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Under the FMLA</span>, an eligible employee is entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of leave per 12 month period. The FMLA guarantees the right of the employee to return to the same position or to an equivalent one. An employer must allow the individual to use any accrued paid leave first, but if that is insufficient to cover the entire period, then the employer should grant unpaid leave. The FMLA requires an employer to continue the employee's health insurance coverage during the leave period, provided the employee pays his/her share of the premiums.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>:&#x2003;An employee with an ADA disability needs 13 weeks of leave for treatment related to the disability. The employee is eligible under the FMLA for 12 weeks of leave (the maximum available), so this period of leave constitutes both FMLA leave and a reasonable accommodation. Under the FMLA, the employer could deny the employee the thirteenth week of leave. But, because the employee is also covered under the ADA, the employer cannot deny the request for the thirteenth week of leave unless it can show undue hardship. The employer may consider the impact on its operations caused by the initial 12-week absence, along with other undue hardship factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1328"></span><span class="Italic">Example B</span>:&#x2003;An employee with an ADA disability has taken 10 weeks of FMLA leave and is preparing to return to work. The employer wants to put her in an equivalent position rather than her oriGINAl one. Although this is permissible under the FMLA the ADA requires that the employer return the employee to her oriGINAl position. Unless the employer can show that this would cause an undue hardship, or that the employee is no longer qualified for her oriGINAl position (with or without reasonable accommodation), the employer must reinstate the employee to her oriGINAl position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>:&#x2003;An employee with an ADA disability has taken 12 weeks of FMLA leave. He notifies his employer that he is ready to return to work, but he no longer is able to perform the essential functions of his position or an equivalent position. Under the FMLA, the employer could terminate his employment, but under the ADA the employer must consider whether the employee could perform the essential functions with reasonable accommodation (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, additional leave, part-time schedule, job restructuring, or use of specialized equipment). If not, the ADA requires the employer to reassign the employee if there is a vacant position available for which he is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, and there is no undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirements for documenting the existence of a disability under the ADA, particularly in light of the ADAAA, are less extensive that the requirements for documenting a serious health condition under FMLA. To the extent that the information required under FMLA would seem to violate the ADA medical inquiry and examination provisions, the Commission's FMLA factsheet at Question 10 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employee requests leave under the FMLA for a serious health condition, employers will not violate the ADA by asking for the information specified in the FMLA certification form. The FMLA form only requests information relating to the particular serious health condition, as defined in the FMLA, for which the employee is seeking leave. An employer is entitled to know why an employee, who otherwise should be at work, is requesting time off under the FMLA. If the inquiries are strictly limited in this fashion, they would be "job-related and consistent with business necessity" under the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120110021 (2011), the Commission also found that an agency's request for medical information under FMLA in support of a leave request was not evidence of discrimination even where the agency had not previously sought such information. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bryant</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency denied Complainant's FMLA requests because she failed to provide documentation needed to support her FMLA's request to the Agency's satisfaction. The Agency's evidence preponderates in this regard. Although Complainant may have been granted FMLA leave in the past by other supervisors or managers and had not been referred to the HR Specialist, this circumstance, without more, does not create discriminatory animus on the part of her supervisor, the HR Specialist, or other management officials. The record establishes that Complainant's supervisor, who no longer works for the Agency, relied on the HR Specialist regarding application of the FMLA criteria. The HR Specialist appeared to be well-versed in the FMLA process and tough in applying criteria to FMLA leave requests, particularly when she suspected, rightly or wrongly, inappropriate requests for FMLA leave. Further, because Complainant did not provide 30-day notice for her FMLA leave requests, it was reasonable for the Agency to ask Complainant for supporting documentation when it appeared to the HR Specialist the time pattern of Complainant's FMLA leave requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the HR Specialist asked Complainant for information not required by the regulations governing FMLA leave requests or that the HR Specialist misinterpreted what was required by FMLA regarding documentation, Complainant has not shown that the HR Specialist or other Agency officials were motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory animus. Even if Complainant had not had to provide the requested medical information in the past, being required to provide the information under another supervisor or having to follow another process not used by previous supervisors does not lead to the conclusion that what was being requested was not what had always been required but may not have been followed because of misunderstanding of FMLA requirements. What may not have been required in the past could have been lack of clarity of what was required to satisfy FMLA leave approval. The HR Specialist stated in her affidavit that the FMLA area was complicated and confusing and that she did her best to educate supervisors and employees to understand FMLA. Further, though the record indicates that Complainant's mother had a lot of medical conditions, and someone else might have characterized the mother's condition as a serious health condition as defined in FMLA regulations, the Commission sees no reason, in the absence of a discriminatory motive, to second guess the Agency's judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency did not discriminate against Complainant. At all times the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with a complainant to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's reasons were pretextual or motivated by intentional discrimination. Here, Complainant has failed to do so.</p>
