<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-82"><span class="space">9.</span> Knowledge Requirement</h4>
<p class="noindent">The appellant must show that the person or persons responsible for taking the personnel action had knowledge of prior EEO activity at the time the action was taken. <span class="Italic">See Clark County School District v. Breeden</span>, 532 U.S. 268, 121 S. Ct. 1508 (2001); <span class="Italic">Mason v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01840126 (1984). Showing prior EEO activity without knowledge of the official or officials alleged to have engaged in retaliation is fatal to a claim of retaliation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Manzanares v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120060417 (2007). A demonstration that the responsible official had knowledge of prior EEO activity shortly after the personnel action is not sufficient proof of a casual connection to state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. If a complainant fails to demonstrate that the agency official responsible for the action knew of the protected activity, he has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ypsilantis v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01A05089 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120131273 (2015) (rating of complainant took place before raters knew of EEO activity). Similarly, if the protected activity took place after the disputed actions, the complainant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Howard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993833 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The knowledge required for the complainant to present a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case refers to the collective knowledge of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. USPS</span>, 01822186 (1983). The fact that the agency official proposing an adverse action is not aware of the employee's past EEO activity does not preclude the complainant from demonstrating agency knowledge where the proposal was reviewed by two higher level officials, one of which was the RMO in a prior EEO complaint filed by the employee. Based on the knowledge of this second level supervisor, the Commission found the agency had failed to establish a legitimate reason for removing the employee on a charge of failure to follow a direct order, where the average penalty was demonstrated as a seven-day suspension. However, an appellant who fails to show that any agency official involved in the selection process had knowledge of his previous complaint has failed to state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Myers v. USPS</span>, 01831880 (1984). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hudgins v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01993775 (2001), the Commission held that preliminary discussions with the EEO counselor, without evidence that the supervisor was aware of the EEO contact, were not sufficient to establish knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent">An appellant cannot prevail by showing only that someone at the agency had knowledge of the protected activity. The employee must show that someone involved in the adverse action had knowledge. The employee bears a burden of proving such knowledge by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Odom v. USPS</span>, 01842223 (1986). A finding of knowledge cannot be based solely on evidence that the appellant engaged in substantial prior activity. In the absence of direct evidence, the Commission will generally not presume the RMO had knowledge of the activity. In some limited cases, however, the Commission may infer agency knowledge where the complainant has filed several complaints in the past. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Tucker v. USPS</span>, 01873123 (1988) (Commission found the RMO's testimony that she was unaware of the appellant's previous complaints not to be credible where the RMO was the subject of prior complaints and both resulted in findings of discrimination); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 01853211 (1987) (limiting finding to the specific facts presented).</p>
<p class="noindent">Constructive knowledge will be imputed to the official taking an action if an official in a position to influence that action conceals his knowledge, thereby allowing the official taking the action to be a "conduit" for retaliation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Echard v. Attorney General</span>, 07A20137 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, the agency argues that the AJ erred in finding evidence of retaliation since there is no evidence in the record that SAC was aware of complainant's prior EEO activity at the time he denied complainant's entrance into the CDP. We find that SAC did not need to have actual knowledge of complainant's prior EEO activity when he was acting as a conduit of ASAC's prejudice<span class="Italic">. See Shager v. Upjohn Co.</span>, 913 F.2d 398 (C.A.7, <span id="Page_1533"></span>1990) (holding that if review committee that was unaware of district manager's age-based animus acted "as the conduit of [manager's] prejudice--his cat's paw--the innocence of its members would not spare the company from liability"). Other Courts have noted that this situation may occur in an instance in which a subordinate, by concealing relevant information from the decision-maker, is able to manipulate the decision-making process and to influence the decision<span class="Italic">. See Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics</span>,<span class="Italic"> Inc.</span>, 103 F.3d 1394, 1400 (7th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Gusman v. Unisys Corp.</span>, 986 F.2d 1146, 1147 (7th Cir. 1993). These cases prevent an employer from escaping liability by setting up many layers of <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> review, thus making the operative decision that of a subordinate with an illicit motive<span class="Italic">. Gusman</span>, 986 F.2d at 1147; <span class="Italic">see Shager</span>, 913 F.2d at 405. In such a case, a jury may impute the discriminatory motive of the biased subordinate, as opposed to the motives of the ignorant decision-maker, to the company.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Perron v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05805 (2001), the Commission found that the RMO had knowledge of the complainant's protected activity because the complainant served as a witness in an EEO complaint filed against him. The administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Perron</span> found that the knowledge requirement was not met because the complainant failed to present evidence which showed that the RMO actually knew of the prior EEO participation. The Commission found, however, that "the complainant's unrefuted testimony, combined with the fact that the prior EEO participation concerned the RMO," was sufficient to meet the knowledge requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that the RMO have personal knowledge of the employee's past EEO activities. It is sufficient if some acknowledgment of those activities appear in the employee's official personnel file and the RMO has access to that file<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Little v. USPS</span>, 01853250 (1987). However, in <span class="Italic">Mohammed v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01881435 (1988), the Commission declined to find knowledge on the part of the RMO where the complainant's prior EEO activity was resolved in court and was the subject of a published decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The showing of knowledge of prior EEO activity, without more, cannot sustain a finding of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Garcia-Gannon v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01821195 (1983). For instance, in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Secretary of the Army</span>, No. 19-2395 (4th Cir. 2022), the Fourth Circuit upheld summary judgment in favor of the agency. emphasizing that "mere knowledge" is not enough:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we assume without deciding that Campbell established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation. We nevertheless conclude, as explained below, that the district court correctly held that the evidence failed to show that the Army's legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons offered for Campbell's termination were pretext for retaliation based on Campbell's EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Campbell challenges the district court's ruling on pretext generally, arguing that the court improperly construed the evidence in the Army's favor. Campbell also cites as evidence of pretext: (1) an email by Sims regarding the "missing" computer in which Sims used the phrase "never ending saga"; (2) Sims' awareness of Campbell's 2005 EEO complaint; (3) Campbell's assignment to become COR-certified despite his advanced degree; (4) Chiu's possible overreaction during the coworker incident; and (5) the short period of time that Campbell was given to enter his timesheet. We disagree with Campbell that this evidence would permit a jury to conclude that his supervisors acted in retaliation for his EEO activity when making the termination decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, in an email exchange between Sims and an employee in the security department regarding Campbell's "missing" computer, Sims used the phrase "never ending saga." Construed in Campbell's favor, the phrase reflects frustration on the part of Sims toward Campbell. But even when considered in conjunction with Sims' awareness that Campbell had filed an EEO complaint of sex and age discrimination in 2005, this evidence showed no connection between Sims' frustration with Campbell and Sims' EEO activity. The 2005 complaint involved prior supervisors, and Campbell himself informed Sims of the previously filed complaint. Sims' awareness of the complaint is insufficient to permit an inference of pretext. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Cerberonics, Inc</span>., 871 F.2d 452, 457 (4th Cir. 1989) ("[M]ere knowledge on the part of an employer that an employee it is about to fire has filed a discrimination charge is not sufficient evidence of retaliation to counter substantial evidence of legitimate reasons for discharging that employee.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also demonstrated that several other employees with advanced degrees had been required to become COR-certified. Thus, a jury could not infer any retaliatory animus based on this assignment. And finally, even if a jury construed the evidence to conclude that Chiu had "overreacted" to Campbell's conduct and that Campbell's failure to complete a timesheet occurred because he did not have sufficient time to do so, such evidence does not call into question Campbell's supervisors' motivations for terminating his employment. The record is silent regarding retaliation, the "real reason" Campbell alleges for his termination from service. <span class="Italic">Jiminez</span>, 57 F.3d at 378 (quoting <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Campbell failed to provide any factual basis for asserting pretext, we conclude that the district court did not improperly weigh any evidence or fail to credit contradictory evidence. <span class="Italic">See Variety Stores, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</span>., 888 F.3d 651, 659 (4th Cir. 2018). Instead, the district court correctly determined that Campbell failed to present evidence from which a jury could conclude that the Army's stated justifications for terminating Campbell were pretext for retaliation based on Campbell's prior EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee further must demonstrate that knowledge of the protected activity in some way affected the agency's decision. Knowledge of an involved official, combined with an inquiry as to whether the employee will continue to pursue an EEO complaint, is sufficient to demonstrate reprisal where the official's explanation of his inquiry is "self-serving." <span class="Italic">Bertels v. Postmaster General</span>, 01890365 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that a supervisor has discussions with other management officials about an EEO complaint is insufficient to establish that prior EEO activity was a factor in a subsequent nonselection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yap v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01933384 (1993). The Commission found there was nothing unusual in such discussion and there was no evidence suggesting the prior EEO activity was a factor in the nonselection for promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although in some cases the Commission has found constructive knowledge on the part of an agency official because of widespread knowledge about the complainant's EEO activity, the mere assertion of the complainant that knowledge is widespread, without some supporting proof, is insufficient to establish knowledge. <span class="Italic">Qatsha v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A14668 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Mitchell H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120141025 (2016), presented an interesting twist on the usual knowledge requirement facts and analysis. In that case, two of the supervisors that had been involved in the earlier EEO complaint were also involved in the instant complaint. Rather than concentrating on the fact that the supervisors did not dispute having knowledge of the prior complaint itself, the Commission used their denials that the complainant had proven that he was subjected to discrimination in his prior complaint as evidence of retaliation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mitchell H</span>., noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several months after the AJ issued his December 2011 decision finding discrimination in Complainant's prior complaint, the Agency issued Complainant his FY 2012 rating in November 2012, establishing a nexus between Complainant's EEO activity and his FY 2012 performance rating. In that regard, we find suspect that the management officials were either unaware or untruthful about Complainant's prior finding of discrimination. The management officials provided testimony in the instant case in June 2013 suggesting that they should have known about the finding at the time they completed their affidavits. The Agency's own investigative record contains a Request to Monitor Compliance dated January 10, 2012. Therein, the Agency recounts that it accepted the AJ's decision that Complainant was subjected to race discrimination when it issued him a "Fully Successful" performance rating for Fiscal Year 2009. <span class="Italic">See</span> ROI at p. 85. It is followed by what appears to be excerpts of the Agency's final order. <span class="Italic">See</span> ROI at 86-88. Furthermore, the Commission's records confirm that a finding of discrimination was made in the prior case EEOC No. 551-2010-00159X. Accordingly, we find it suspect that management denied Complainant's claim that these same management officials had previously discriminated against him.</p>
