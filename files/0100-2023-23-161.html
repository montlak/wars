<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-156"><span class="space">B.</span> PERFORMANCE STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">An employer is not required to lower performance standards for an individual with a disability as a reasonable accommodation. An employer is required to provide a reasonable accommodation that will assist an individual in meeting performance standards, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission provides the following further explanation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee with a disability must meet the same production standards, whether quantitative or qualitative, as a non-disabled employee in the same job. Lowering or changing a production standard because an employee cannot meet it due to a disability is not considered a reasonable accommodation. However, a reasonable accommodation may be required to assist an employee in meeting a specific production standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Practical&#x2003;Guidance: It is advisable for employers to give clear guidance to an employee with a disability (as well as all other employees) regarding the quantity and quality of work that must be produced and the timetables for producing it.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>: A federal agency requires all of its investigators to complete 30 investigations per year in addition to other responsibilities. Jody's disability is worsening, causing her increased difficulty in completing 30 investigations while also conducting training and writing articles for a newsletter. Jody tells her supervisor about her disability and requests that she be allowed to eliminate the marginal functions of her job so that she can focus on performing investigations. After determining that conducting trainings and writing articles are marginal functions for Jody and that no undue hardship exists, the agency reassigns Jody's marginal functions as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>: Robert is a sales associate for a pharmaceutical company. His territory covers a 3-state region and he must travel to each state three times a year. Due to staff cutbacks, the company is increasing the number of states for each salesperson from three to five. Robert explains to his manager that due to his disability he cannot handle the extra two states and the increased traveling, and he asks that he be allowed to have responsibility only for his original three states. The company may refuse this request for accommodation because it conflicts with the new production standard. However, the company should explore with Robert whether there is any reasonable accommodation that could enable him to service five states, and if not, whether reassignment is possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 3:</span> A computer programmer with a known disability has missed deadlines for projects, necessitating that other employees finish his work. Further, the employee has not kept abreast of changes in the database package, causing him to misinterpret as system problems changes that he should have known about. The employee is placed on a Performance Improvement Plan, but his performance does not improve and he is terminated. At no time does the employee request a reasonable accommodation (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, inform the employer that he requires an adjustment or change as a result of a medical condition). The termination is justified as long as the employer holds the employee to the same performance standards as other programmers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Applying Performance</span>, Sec. IIIA, Q. 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employer should evaluate an individual with a disability under the same performance standards as employees without disabilities. Doing so, the Commission notes, may put an employee on notice that his or her disability is causing a performance problem. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Q. 2. The Commission gives the following example:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example 4</span>: Last year Nicole received an "above average" review at her annual performance evaluation. During the current year Nicole had to deal with a number of medical issues concerning her disability. As a result, she was unable to devote the same level of time and effort to her job as she did during the prior year. She did not request reasonable accommodation <span class="Italic">(i.e.</span>, inform the employer that she requires an adjustment or change as a result of a medical condition). The quantity and quality of Nicole's work were not as high and she received an "average" rating. The supervisor does not have to raise Nicole's rating even though the decline in performance was related to her disability.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the employer may as a reasonable accommodation have to permit the employee to perform the job in a manner different from other employees in order to meet performance standards, unless doing so would present an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Q. 3. Again, the Commission provides examples:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example 5</span>: One of Rhoda's essential functions is providing training. Because she is deaf and, as a result, has difficulty speaking, Rhoda uses a sign language interpreter to voice for her. Generally, Rhoda's supervisor evaluates his employees on the use of their voices--whether they speak with a monotone or use their voices to show interest and enthusiasm. Rhoda's presentation cannot be measured in this way. However, there are alternative ways to measure how she conveys her message, including body language, facial expression, and the words she uses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example 6</span>: Daniel works as a millwright, and an essential function of his job is repairing and maintaining equipment. Most of the equipment is accessible only by climbing ladders and steps. Due to a recent disability, Daniel no longer can climb and must work only at ground level. The location of the equipment does not allow alternative means to elevate Daniel (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, using a cherry picker). With no reasonable accommodation possible, Daniel cannot repair the equipment (an essential function). Daniel is not "qualified" to remain in this position and the employer should explore whether it can reassign him as a reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120121339 (2015), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant when it did not alter the workload as an accommodation. In doing so, the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant was seeking a reduction in performance standards as an accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant's DocLab position, the Agency, in its final decision, asserted that it accommodated Complainant by assigning a coworker to lift boxes for her. In its decision, the Agency also noted that Complainant was afraid to ask for more accommodation and there was no evidence that management knew that Complainant required additional accommodation. Notwithstanding the Agency's assertions that management had no knowledge that Complainant needed additional accommodation, there is no dispute that management was aware that Complainant had trouble with fine motor skills with her hands due to her Cerebral Palsy. The record reflects that the Agency was on notice that Complainant needed accommodation due to her requests in her previous Security Specialist position. We note that an agency's duty to provide reasonable accommodation is ongoing and that certain individuals require only one reasonable accommodation, while others may need more than one. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, management was aware that Complainant had issues with fine motor skills with her hands and had primarily been assigned <span id="Page_1256"></span>FOIA work. As the ASC explained, FOIA work is more difficult and time consuming than other types of work because serial numbers have to be traced over, copies have to be made of brittle onion skin paper, orders of pages reversed or corrected. The position required the manipulation of volumes of documentation through the removal of paper clips, staples, and bindings. According to the ASC, Complainant would have met the Agency's required metric standards if she was assigned other types of work in addition to her FOIA work as other employees were.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency argued in its final decision that, according to case law, employers need not adjust performance metrics downward as an accommodation. It is correct to state that an employer is not required to lower production standards and also not required to reallocate or eliminate essential functions of a position in association with an accommodation request. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance. However, Complainant never specifically asked the Agency to lower production standards as a reasonable accommodation or to eliminate essential functions. As explained, the reason Complainant was unable to meet the required performance metrics was because she was given the more difficult, time consuming, fragile complaint files. The FOIA files were even more difficult for Complainant than other employees because of her trouble with fine motor skills. ROI, Ex. 9A, at 10. As the ASC averred, Complainant likely would have been able to meet the required metric standards if the Agency would have assigned her a mix of file types, as other DocLab employees were assigned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Ex. 18E, at 6. The ASC averred:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I became concerned that a fair representation of metrics would not be portrayed, since FOIA assignments are much more difficult...Serial numbers have to be traced over, copies have to be made of brittle onion skin paper, orders of pages reversed or corrected, etc. To perform 450 pages per hour (PPH) with these constraints is difficult at best. This is why the 450 PPM metric was originally analyzed and set from a composite of work (from very clean paper requiring no copying or tracing, to mid range, to the worst, FOIA). It is expected that through the course of a month that employees would have all types of work and the numbers would balance out. Experienced staff have had difficulty meeting metric standards when given FOIA material alone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency was not required to lower production standards, it nevertheless was required to present Complainant with accommodations to reasonably enable her to meet those metrics. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720120034 (Nov. 26, 2014) (finding that although the agency was not required to a lower production standard, it was required to provide reasonable accommodation to enable complainant to meet that standard); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12367 (June 26, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. for recon den'd</span>, EEOC Request No, 05A21029 (Oct. 3, 2002) (finding that an agency, which was not required to lower production quotas, reasonably accommodated complainant because it offered her alternative measures geared toward reducing the stress from the production quotas).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note also that, after evaluating Complainant's performance as a Security Specialist position with her disability, the Agency reassigned Complainant to the DocLab position. Had the Agency not believed that Complainant could perform the essential functions of the DocLab position with accommodation, there would have been no point in assigning her there. The ASC advocated against Complainant's termination. Notwithstanding the ASC's recommendation, the Agency terminated Complainant from her DocLab position without engaging in the interactive process regarding her accommodation needs when, according to the ASC, there was a means to accommodate her. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established that she was denied reasonable accommodation for her disability as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also rejected the agency's argument that it had engaged in a good faith effort at accommodation and was not liable for compensatory damages noting that the agency placed the complainant on a performance improvement plan, gave her an unacceptable rating, and when that rating was overturned, placed her on another performance improvement plan and threatened her with removal and, ultimately, reassigned her.</p>
