<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-31"><span class="space">4.</span> Failure of Agency to Provide Reasons</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not decline to provide the specific reasons for taking a personnel action, even when that denial is based on agency nondisclosure regulations. To permit an agency to refuse to provide the specific reasons for its actions deprives the complainant of a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912402 (1991). In that case, the agency refused to provide the results of a driving examination that it contended the complainant failed. The agency argued that its nondisclosure policy was to prevent the contents of such examinations from becoming public knowledge. The Commission rejected the agency's arguments noting that EEO administrative proceedings are closed to the public and the file is protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. The Commission remanded the case for the agency to provide specific reasons for the agency's determination that the complainant had failed the test.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Guajardo v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01956664 (1998), the Commission found that the agency failed to meet its burden of production where the selecting official could not remember why she had not selected the complainant for several standing committee assignments. In <span class="Italic">Cottrell v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01973583 (1999), the Commission found that the selecting official's "amnesia" warranted an adverse inference to the effect that the complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and, because the official could remember nothing about the selection, the agency failed to meet its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its selection. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120055933 (2007) (both agency officials who gave affidavits said they were not familiar with circumstances of complainant's claims).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120123094 (2015), the Commission reversed an agency finding of no discrimination where the Career Board redacted minutes of a meeting during which the complainant's transfer request was denied. The Commission rejected an agency rationale that the complainant had not shown pretext by impeaching the denial of Career Board members that they had no engaged in discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The meeting minutes indicate the identity of the Agency officials in attendance and the official preparing the minutes (B1), but the remaining contents of the minutes are redacted. The Commission notes that nothing in the record indicates the reasons for the redaction and we decline to assume anything about the redacted portions. As noted in the Agency's Final Decision, the minutes do not indicate specifically which Career Board member or members denied Complainant's request and the minutes provide no information regarding the reason for the Career Board's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency acknowledged that the failure of the Career Board to provide a substantive reason for its denial creates a problem. The following acknowledgment appears in the Agency's Final Decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In this case, it was troubling that [Agency] management did not clearly articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying complainant's request for a transfer under the MCSTP. In two memoranda located in the case file, [B1] indicated that complainant's request for the transfer and his request for reconsideration were denied, but [B1] provided no specific reason for those decisions. In the absence of clear reasons, it is difficult to determine if [Agency] management acted with prohibited discriminatory intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in a memorandum in the record from the Department of Justice's Complaint Adjudication Officer (CAD) to the Agency's EEO Officer, dated June 12, 2012, the CAD cautions the Agency regarding the "policy of declining to provide reasons for the decisions of the Agency Career Board." The CAD advises that ". . .[Agency] officials should be willing to provide legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment-related decisions of its Career Board, and failure to provide such reasons could form the basis for unfavorable EEO claim decisions in the future."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_711"></span>We find the future is now. The Agency has not escaped a finding of discrimination in the instant case based upon the blanket denials of discrimination by the Agency officials serving on the Career Board at the time of Complainant's request. We decline to guess which Agency official actually made the decision, though it appears B1 takes responsibility for it. Similarly, the record does not disclose what roles other Career Board members served in the decision-making process. Additionally, we are not persuaded by the Final Decision's reliance on the Agency's policy that such transfer decisions are discretionary and made consistent with staffing needs of the Agency, while failing to indicate the specific reasons for the denial of Complainant's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its Final Decision, the Agency states that Complainant failed to present evidence to impeach the statements of the Career Board members who denied being motivated by sex discrimination. We find the Agency failed to provide Complainant with any meaningful opportunity to demonstrate the Agency's decision was discriminatory or pretextual in the absence of any clear, specific statement regarding the reasons for denying Complainant's transfer request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the Agency's failure to provide a sufficient articulation of the reasons for denying Complainant's request for reassignment to the Washington, D.C. area, as described in Complainant's complaint, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to overcome Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination. Accordingly, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of sex as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency does not sustain its burden of production when the two potential selecting officials each testify that the other one was responsible for the decision and neither official gave a reason for the selection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Linton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992294 (2002). The fact that the selecting official retired prior to the EEO investigation does not excuse the agency from coming forward with evidence of the reasons for making a selection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eubanks v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A40070 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the complainant, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established the complainant is relieved of any further burden, unless the agency comes forward with a specific explanation for its action. In <span class="Italic">Treese v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995884 (2002), the Commission found that the agency failed to come forward with an explanation of its reason for demoting the complainant during a restructuring and improperly tried to shift the entire burden of proof to the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency has failed to meet this burden. The explanation for its failure to select complainant for either of the positions in question is neither specific, clear, nor individualized. Indeed, it is so generalized and vaporous as to be virtually content free. The only portion of the 6-page-long FAD containing any substantive discussion of the reasons for complainant's nonselection is the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The record reflects that you were one of many employees for which a position had to be found as a result of postal restructuring. Although you were placed in a lower level position, you lost no pay or benefits in the process. More importantly, you produced no evidence to show that your qualifications were equal to or plainly superior to those of the individuals placed in the positions in question. Changes are inevitable in major organizational restructuring as occurred in the Postal Service; however, the fact that you failed to get what you wanted during the process does not equate to prohibited discrimination. (emphasis supplied)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD completely ignores the agency's affirmative obligation to explain with particularity why it took the allegedly discriminatory action. Instead it places all the burden to account for the agency's behavior on complainant. The italicized portion of the quotation suggests that the agency might have found the selectees to be more qualified than complainant but provides no specifics. Did the agency chose [sic] the selectee for the postmaster position because she was better educated than complainant? Was the selectee for the labor relations specialist position successful because she had more experience than complainant? The agency provides not even the vaguest clue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency gives no reasons for its failure to promote complainant other than generalized statements such as "you were one of many employees for which a position had to be found as a result of postal restructuring" and "changes are inevitable in major organizational restructuring." It is apparently of the view that it had no obligation to offer any explanation for why complainant, in particular, had not been promoted. This constitutes a failure on the agency's part to met its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. The consequence of that failure is that complainant, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to make any demonstration of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to preserve appropriate documents surrounding a selection can lead to an agency's inability to carry its burden of production. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gaffney v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973828 (1998), the agency was unable to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason where it had not asked the selecting official for an affidavit during the investigation and the official was unavailable for the hearing due to her death. The Commission noted that the agency also failed to preserve any documents from the screening panel and that, although some agency officials provided statements during the investigation with negative comments about the complainant's performance, none of these officials had participated in the selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency fails to comply with a remand order for supplemental investigations, the Commission is free to impose an adverse inference on the agency. Such an inference can prevent an agency from meeting its burden of production. For example in <span class="Italic">Lebron v. Postmaster General</span>, 01943052 (1996), the Commission remanded the case for the taking of affidavits from the selecting officials on why they had not chosen the complainant for acting supervisor positions. The failure of the agency to provide such affidavits resulted in the Commission holding that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Curiously, in <span class="Italic">Hasty v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01952006 (1997), the Commission found the agency had articulated a legitimate reason for its nonselection of the complainant, even though the agency's explanation was so obtuse as to be incomprehensible. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hasty</span> explained, or at least attempted to explain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of the decision to remove appellant from Position 1, the RO stated that it was done because "we were aligning our positions" within the Cone. PRS 1 elaborated on this explanation, stating the action was taken in order to balance the Cone, and explaining that, when there is a UA 12 sitting in a UA 13 position and vice versa, it means that there is no position for which you can consider someone for a promotional opportunity. Although this explanation is not entirely clear, we find that it is sufficient to satisfy the agency's burden of production at this stage.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, the finding was merely a consolation prize as the Commission found there was ample evidence of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">When more than one personnel action is involved, the agency must articulate a separate, legitimate reason for both actions. In <span class="Italic">Ragstogi v. Director, U.S. Information Agency</span>, 01964020 (1999), the Commission found that the agency had not articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a second performance appraisal, where the ranking official's testimony was only directed to the first appraisal. Even though the overall rating in both appraisals was the same, the rating on the individual elements was different. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ragstogi</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency apparently believes that the explanation the RO provided for the 1993-94 rating also explains the reasoning behind the 1994-95 rating, the Commission disagrees. Specifically, although both ratings are identical, there were significant differences in the ratings appellant received in the individual elements. In particular, after being rated "Highly Successful" on Element 1 on the 1992-93 and 1993-94 appraisals, appellant was rated "Fully Successful" in that element on the 1994-95 appraisal. Additionally, although the RO had given appellant ratings of "Outstanding" on Element 3 on the 1992-93 and 1993-94 appraisals, the rating in that element was dropped to "Fully Successful" on the 1994-95 appraisal. Absent any testimony from the RO addressing these differences, and because these differences were directly responsible for appellant's rating remaining "Fully Successful," the Commission concludes that the RO's rationale for the 1993-94 rating does not explain the reasoning behind the 1994-95 rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, the Commission ordered the rating be raised to "Highly Successful."</p>
<p class="noindent">A recurring situation involves officials responsible for taking actions who have left the agency and can no longer be compelled to testify or records relating to the action that have been lost, misplaced or destroyed. Sometimes, the absence of testimony or supporting records can preclude an agency from meeting its burden of production, but nothing prevents an agency from proving a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason through indirect evidence. The case of <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A40113 (2005), demonstrates how both can occur:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that during complainant's EEO counseling session, the EEO counselor made several attempts to obtain the selection package for the Spokane position from the appropriate sources, but without success. ROI Exhibit F7. While complainant's application materials were provided, the application materials of S3 are missing. As previously noted, EEOC regulations require that any personnel or employment record made or kept by an employer be preserved by the employer for a period of one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14. The record shows that the selection certificate was dated October 25, 1995, Exhibit F8c, the date of the appointment is unknown, and complainant first contacted the EEO counselor on November 20, 1995. Exhibit B1a. The EEO investigator was able to locate the selection certificate for the position, signed by SO 1. Exhibit F8c. However, the portion of this document intended to provide reasons for the selection was left blank.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The record contains no other materials relating to the selection. Where a charge of discrimination has been filed, the agency is required to preserve all personnel records relevant to the charge until final disposition of the charge. &#x00A7; 1602.14. Finally, as noted above, the agency reports that SO1 retired from the agency and did not offer a statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_712"></span>The agency argues that complainant has "provided no persuasive evidence that officials considered his protected classifications in the decision not to select him for the Spokane vacancy." FAD, p. 12. Such an argument, however, misconstrues the three-step process established by <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas.</span> As we found above, complainant has provided sufficient evidence to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that discrimination occurred. The agency next argues that, because the agency was able to provide evidence that discrimination played no part in the other nonselections at issue in this case, nonselections that involved the same management officials, "there is no appropriate basis for concluding that complainant was discriminated against" in the Spokane nonselection. We find no support for the proposition that the absence of evidence of discrimination in one action is indicative of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory behavior in another action by the same management official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the agency has not articulated a reason explaining why S3 was selected instead of complainant, and thus does not rebut complainant's prima fade case of national origin discrimination and reprisal, we find that the agency has failed to articulate a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for its actions, and consequently, complainant was denied a fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext.<span class="Italic"> See Young v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request 05940517 (October 13, 1995). Thus, we find that complainant was discriminated against on the bases of national origin in violation of Title VII, when he was not selected for the Spokane position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once again, the agency was unable to provide the application materials of the candidates and therefore an objective comparison of the candidates' qualifications and experience is once again not possible. As with Claim 1, however, we note that the statements of the members of the selection panel were consistent in finding that S4 was the better candidate because of his performance during the interview, and their statements are corroborated by their contemporaneous notes taken during the selection process. Complainant contends that he spoke with the other two candidates after the interviews and that "it seemed to me that I was asked questions that were not asked of the other two." Exhibit F3, p. 4. He admits, however, that he "felt a bit of hopelessness during the interview because I did not feel they would select me."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> He further stated that S4 had twice worked for one of the panel members in the past but complainant knew nothing else of S4's experience.<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> p.5. Finally, we note that, on appeal, complainant has not disputed the contentions of the panel members that he did not fully respond to the questions asked during the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the fact that the contemporaneous notes taken by the selection panel corroborate the statements they made to the EEO Counselor, that the notes and statements both explain why S4 was selected and why complainant was not, and finally that complainant admits that he "felt hopeless" during the interview and that he does not know whether he was better qualified than S4, we find that he has not met his burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his qualifications were demonstrably superior and that the agency's reasons were pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency fails to articulate a legitimate reason, it is error for the administrative judge to find that the agency has sustained its burden of production by speculating as to a possible legitimate reason. For example, in <span class="Italic">Opare-Addo v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120060802 (2007), one supervisor testified that he could not remember reassigning the complainant or changing his duties. A second supervisor testified that the other supervisor instructed him to reassign the complainant, but never gave a reason for the reassignment. The administrative judge found that the agency sustained its burden, nonetheless, by speculating that reassignment could have been because management had lost confidence in the complainant's managerial abilities. The Commission held that the speculation was error.</p>
