<h2 class="h2" id="sec22-25"><span class="space">III.</span> THE "LODESTAR"</h2>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC adopted the standards articulated in <span class="Italic">Evans v. Sheraton Park Hotel</span>, 503 F.2d 177 (D.C. Cir. 1974) and <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia High Express, Inc.</span>, 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), in awarding attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Geurra v. Department of Army</span>, 01821377 (1983). Fees are calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the attorney on the matter by a reasonable hourly rate. This formula is referred to as the "lodestar" and generally is the beginning of the fee inquiry, once prevailing party status is established. <span class="Italic">See Washington v. Department of Transportation</span>, 01832463 (1984). Although fees are recoverable, the hours expended must be in the context of the actual EEO complaint at issue. The fact that the appellant discovers information useful to his EEO complaint in a court proceeding relating to an earlier EEO complaint does not justify a fee award for the hours expended on that case. <span class="Italic">See Geurra</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC's regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B), provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The amount of attorney's fees shall be calculated using the following standards: The starting point shall be the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. There is a strong presumption that this amount represents the reasonable fee. In limited circumstances, this amount may be reduced or increased in consideration of the degree of success, quality of representation, and long delay caused by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has elaborated on the regulation, at length, in MD-110 at 11-13 to 11-16:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Attorney's fees will be computed by determining the "lodestar." The "lodestar" is the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983). By regulation, the Commission uses the same basis for calculating the amount of attorney's fees. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;All hours reasonably spent in processing the complaint are compensable. Fees shall be paid for services performed by an attorney after the filing of a written complaint, provided that the attorney provides reasonable notice of representation to the agency, Administrative Judge, or Commission, except that fees are allowable for a reasonable period of time prior to the notification of representation for any services performed in reaching a determination to represent the complainant. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(1)(iv).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Fees for services rendered during the pre-complaint process may be awarded only under the circumstances set forth above in Section III.B. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(1)(iv).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;An attorney is eligible for work performed at the appeals stage for an award of fees, provided the complainant prevails at this stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;The number of hours should not include excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434; <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998). The presence of multiple counsel at hearing or deposition may be considered duplicative in certain situations, such as where one or more counsel had little or no participation or where the presence of multiple counsel served to delay or prolong the hearing or deposition. <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dep't. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 1992). The presence of multiple counsel is not necessarily duplicative, however, and is often justifiable. Time spent on clearly meritless arguments or motions, and time spent on unnecessarily uncooperative or contentious conduct may be deducted. <span class="Italic">Luciano v.

<p class="noindent-2">e.&#x2003;A reasonable hourly rate is a rate based on "prevailing market rates in the relevant community" for attorneys of similar experience in similar cases. <span class="Italic">Cooley v.

A higher rate for time spent at hearing may be reasonable if trial work would command a higher rate under prevailing community standards. Where multiple attorneys have worked on the case, the rate for each attorney should be determined separately. The limits on hourly rates contained in the Equal Access to Justice Act are not applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">f.&#x2003;The applicable rate for fee awards to public interest attorneys is the prevailing hourly rate for the community in general. <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dep't. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 1992). In <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court held that the prevailing market rate should also be used to determine fee awards to private, for-profit attorneys <span id="Page_1990"></span>who represent certain clients at reduced rates, which reflect "non-economic" goals. <span class="Italic">See also Cooley v. Dep't. of Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960748 (July 30, 1998); <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Dep't. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01892909 (Dec. 12, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">g.&#x2003;The hours spent on unsuccessful claims should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee only where the unsuccessful claims are distinct in all respects from the successful claims. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">h.&#x2003;The degree of success is an important factor in calculating an award of attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103 (1992). In determining the degree of success, the relief obtained (including both monetary and equitable relief) should be considered in light of the complainant's goals. <span class="Italic">City of Riverside v. Rivera</span>, 477 U.S. 561 (1986); <span class="Italic">Cullins v. Georgia Department of Transportation</span>, 29 F.3d 1489 (1994). Where the complainant achieved only limited success, the complainant should receive only the amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983); <span class="Italic">Cerny v. Dep't. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930899 (Oct. 19, 1994). However, a reasonable fee may not be determined by mathematical formula based on monetary relief obtained. <span class="Italic">Riverside</span> at 563; <span class="Italic">Cullins</span> at 1493. The determination of the degree of success should be made on a case-by-case basis. In many cases, an award of equitable relief only or a small award of monetary damages may reflect a high degree of success. Failure to obtain the maximum damages allowable or a large monetary award generally does not reflect limited success.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;There is a strong presumption that the lodestar represents the reasonable fee. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B). In limited circumstances, the lodestar figure may be adjusted upward or downward, taking into account the degree of success, the quality of representation, and long delay caused by the agency. The lodestar may be adjusted only under the circumstances described in this subpart.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;An award of attorney's fees may be enhanced in cases of exceptional success. The complainant must show that such an enhancement is necessary to determine a reasonable fee. <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557 (1992). Conversely, a fee award may be reduced in cases of limited success. <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland I.S.D.,</span> 489 U.S. 782 (1989). However, there is no requirement that fee awards be proportional to the amount of monetary damages awarded. <span class="Italic">City of Riverside v. Rivera</span>, 477 U.S. 561 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;An award of attorney's fees may be enhanced where the quality of representation is exceptional. <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Kennickell</span>, 875 F.2d 330 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Conversely, the award of attorney's fees may be reduced where the quality of representation was poor, the attorney's conduct resulted in undue delay or obstruction of the process, or where settlement likely could have been reached much earlier but for the attorney's conduct. <span class="Italic">Lanasa v. City of New Orleans</span>, 619 F. Supp. 39 (E.D. La. 1985); <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Kalinowski</span>, 458 F. Supp. 689 (M.D. Pa. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;The lodestar may not be enhanced to compensate for the risk of non-payment, risk of losing the case, or difficulty finding counsel. <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;A lodestar may be adjusted to compensate for a long delay where the delay is caused by the agency. <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council</span>, 483 U.S. 711 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">e.&#x2003;If the Administrative Judge or agency determines that an adjustment to the lodestar is appropriate, the Administrative Judge or agency may calculate the adjustment by either adding or subtracting a lump sum from the lodestar figure or by adding or subtracting a percentage of the lodestar. The Administrative Judge or agency has discretion to determine the amount of the adjustment. Normally, the adjustment should be no more or less than 75% of the lodestar figure. The Administrative Judge or agency must provide a detailed written explanation of why the adjustment was made, and what factors supported the adjustment. <span class="Italic">Coutin v. Young &#x0026; Rubicam Puerto Rico, Inc</span>., 124 F.3d 331 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">f.&#x2003;The party seeking to adjust the lodestar, either up or down, has the burden of justifying the deviation. <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Marshall</span>, 641 F.2d 880, 892 (D.C. Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't. of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944999 (May 17, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Where a complainant rejects an offer of resolution and the final decision is not more favorable than the offer, attorney's fees and costs incurred after the expiration of the thirty (30)-day acceptance period are not compensable. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(c)(3). This regulation further provides that an Administrative Judge may award attorney's fees and costs despite the complainant's failure to accept an offer of resolution where "the interests of justice would not be served" by a denial of fees. An example of when fees would be appropriate is where the complainant received an offer of resolution, but was informed by a responsible agency official that the agency would not comply in good faith with the offer (for example, would unreasonably delay implementation of the relief offered). A complainant who rejected the offer for that reason, and who obtained less relief than was contained in the offer of resolution, would not be denied attorney's fees in this situation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notice that fee enhancement is an exceptional remedy for the complainant, but fee reduction is not exceptional for the agency. The burden of proving entitlement to fees rests with the claimant, but the burden to justify any deviation from the lodestar rests with the party proposing the deviation. <span class="Italic">Ewers v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01842010 (1986). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120055354 (2007) (fee reduction not justified where agency gave no explanation of reasons for reduction).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once prevailing party status is established, most fee disputes center around the reasonable hourly rate or the number of hours reasonably expended, if not both issues. However, in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), the Supreme Court, in a case involving an action under 42 USC 1983, determined that it is possible to be a prevailing party and still get no fee award. In essence, the Court found that, in some cases, no award is a reasonable fee. To the complainant who comes up empty-handed on a fee award, the distinction between not getting a fee award because he or she is not the prevailing party and no fee award being reasonable may seem meaningless. It is, nonetheless, an important distinction because, in a way, it provides an agency with two bites at the apple. The <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> doctrine and its adoption by the Commission also is discussed in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-30-008.html#sec22-9">Prevailing Parties</a>," above. But, it also bears discussion here because it is properly part of the determination of the reasonableness of a fee award and not the determination of whether the party has prevailed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the plaintiffs filed a civil rights action seeking $17 million in compensatory damages. Although the plaintiffs prevailed in their action, they received only $1 in nominal damages. The Court found that, given the extent to which the plaintiffs prevailed, the only reasonable fee award was no award at all. The concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 113 S. Ct. 575-79, is most often cited as providing the guidelines for evaluating the overall reasonableness of a fee award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has authorized the federal courts to award "a reasonable attorney's fee" in certain civil rights cases, but only to "the prevailing party." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988; <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 789, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 1491, 103 L. Ed.2d 866 (1989). To become a prevailing party, a plaintiff must obtain, at an absolute minimum, "actual relief on the merits of [the] claim," <span class="Italic">ante</span>, at 573, which "affects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff," <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. Helms</span>, 482 U.S. 755, 761, 107 S. Ct. 2672, 2676, 96 L. Ed.2d 654 (1987) (emphasis omitted); <span class="Italic">accord, ante</span>, at 573 (relief obtained must "alte[r] the legal relationship between the parties" and "modif[y] the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff"). Joseph Farrar met that minimum condition for prevailing party status. Through this lawsuit, he obtained an enforceable judgment for one dollar in nominal damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One dollar is not exactly a bonanza, but it constitutes relief on the merits. And it affects the defendant's behavior toward the plaintiff, if only by forcing him to pay one dollar--Something he would not otherwise have done. <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 574. Nonetheless, <span class="Italic">Garland</span> explicitly states that an enforceable judgment alone is not always enough: "Beyond th[e] absolute limitation [of some relief on the merits], a technical victory may be so insignificant...as to be insufficient to support an award of attorney's fees." 489 U.S., at 792, 109 S. Ct., at 1493. While <span class="Italic">Garland</span> may be read as indicating that this <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or technical victory exclusion is a second barrier to prevailing party status, the Court makes clear today that, in fact, it is part of the determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee. Compare <span class="Italic">ibid.</span> (purely technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> victories are "insufficient to support prevailing party status") with <span class="Italic">ante</span>, at 574 (the "technical" nature of the victory "does not affect the prevailing party inquiry" but instead "bear[s] on the propriety of fees awarded under &#x00A7; 1981"). And even if the exclusion's location is debatable, its effect is not: When the plaintiff's success is purely technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, no fees can be awarded. Such a plaintiff either has failed to achieve victory at all, or has obtained only a pyrrhic victory for which the reasonable fee is zero. The Court's opinion today and its unanimous opinion in <span class="Italic">Garland</span> are thus in accord. <span class="Italic">See ante</span> at 575 (merely "forma[l]" victory can yield "no attorney's fees at all"); <span class="Italic">Garland, supra</span>, at 792, 109 S. Ct., at 1493 ("Where the plaintiff's success on a legal claim can be characterized as purely technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, a district court would be justified in concluding that" denial of attorney's fees is appropriate).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Court properly holds that, when a plaintiff's victory is purely technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, a district court need not go through the usual complexities involved in calculating attorneys fees<span class="Italic">. Ante</span>, at 575 (court need not calculate presumptive fee by determining the number of hours reasonably expended and multiplying it by the reasonable hourly rate; nor must it apply the 12 factors bearing on reasonableness).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a matter of common sense and sound judicial administration, it would be wasteful indeed to require that courts laboriously and mechanically <span id="Page_1991"></span>go through those steps when the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the victory makes the proper fee immediately obvious. Instead, it is enough for a court to explain why the victory is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and announce a sensible decision to "award low fees or no fees" at all. <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> Precedent confirms what common sense suggests. It goes without saying that, if the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exclusion were to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining prevailing party status, fees would have to be denied. <span class="Italic">Supra,</span> at 570. And if the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> victory exclusion is in fact part of the reasonableness inquiry, <span class="Italic">see ante</span> at 574, summary denial of fees is still appropriate. We have explained that even the prevailing plaintiff may be denied fees if special circumstances would render [the] award unjust. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983) (citations omitted). While that exception to fee awards has often been articulated separately from the reasonableness inquiry, sometimes it is bound up with reasonableness: It serves as a short-hand way of saying that, even before calculating a lodestar or wading through all the reasonableness factors, it is clear that the reasonable fee is no fee at all. After all, where the only reasonable fee is no fee, an award of fees would be unjust; conversely, where a fee award would be unjust, the reasonable fee is no fee at all. Of course, no matter how much sense this approach makes, it would be wholly inappropriate to adopt it if Congress had declared a contrary intent. When construing a statute, this Court is bound by the choices Congress has made, not the choices we might wish it had made. Felicitously, here they are one and the same. Section 1988 was enacted for a specific purpose: to restore the former equitable practice of awarding attorney's fees to the prevailing party in certain civil rights cases, a practice this Court had disapproved in <span class="Italic">Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society</span>, 421 U.S. 240, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed.2d 141 (1975). <span class="Italic">Hensley, supra</span>, 461 U.S., at 429, 103 S. Ct., at 1936; <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 6 (1976) U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1976 pp. 5908, 5913 ("This bill creates no startling new remedy--it only meets the technical requirements that the Supreme Court has laid down if the Federal courts are to continue the practice of awarding attorneys' fees which had been going on for years prior to the Court's [<span class="Italic">Alyeska</span>] decision"). That practice included the denial of fees to plaintiffs who, although technically prevailing parties, had achieved only <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> success. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tatum v. Morton</span>, 386 F. Supp. 1308, 1317-1319 (DC 1974) (fees denied where plaintiffs recovered $100 each); <span class="Italic">see also Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.</span>, 396 U.S. 375, 392, 396, 90 S. Ct. 616, 625, 627, 24 L. Ed.2d 593 (1970) (under judge-made fee-shifting rule for shareholder actions that benefit the corporation, no fees are available if the only benefit achieved is merely "'technical in its consequence'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Bosch v. Meeker Cooperative Light &#x0026; Power Assn.</span>, 257 Minn. 362, 366, 367, 101 N.W.2d 423, 426, 427 (1960)); <span class="Italic">cf. Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club</span>, 463 U.S. 680, 688, n.9, 103 S. Ct. 3274, 3279, n.9, 77 L. Ed.2d 938 1983) ("[W]e do not mean to suggest that trivial success on the merits, or purely procedural victories, would justify an award of fees under statutes setting out the 'when appropriate' standard").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And although Congress did not intend to restore every detail of pre-<span class="Italic">Alyeska</span> practice, <span class="Italic">see West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey</span>, 499 U.S. __, __, 111 S. Ct. __. Here that suggestion is quite strong. Joseph Farrar asked for 17 million dollars; he got one. It is hard to envision a more dramatic difference. The difference between the amount recovered and the damages sought is not the only consideration, however. <span class="Italic">Carey v. Piphus</span>, 435 U.S. 247, 254, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 1047, 55 L. Ed.2d 252 (1978), makes clear that an award of nominal damages can represent a victory in the sense of vindicating rights even though no actual damages are proved. <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 573. Accordingly, the courts also must look to other factors. One is the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff claims to have prevailed. <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, 489 U.S., at 792, 109 S. Ct., at 1493. Petitioners correctly point out that Joseph Farrar in a sense succeeded on a significant issue--liability. But even on that issue he cannot be said to have achieved a true victory. Respondent was just one of six defendants and the only one not found to have engaged in a conspiracy. If recovering one dollar from the least culpable defendant and nothing from the rest legitimately can be labeled a victory--and I doubt that it can--surely it is a hollow one. Joseph Farrar may have won a point, but the game, set, and match all went to the defendants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that Joseph Farrar got some of what he wanted--one seventeen millionth, to be precise--his success might be considered material if it also accomplished some public goal other than occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client. Section 1988 is not "a relief Act for lawyers." <span class="Italic">Riverside v. Rivera</span>, 477 U.S. 561, 588, 106 S. Ct. 2686, 2701, 91 L. Ed.2d 466 (1986) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). Instead, it is a tool that ensures the vindication of important rights, even when large sums of money are not at stake, by making attorney's fees available under a private attorney general theory. Yet one searches these facts in vain for the public purpose this litigation might have served. The District Court speculated that the judgment, if accompanied by a large fee award, might deter future lawless conduct, <span class="Italic">see</span> App. to Pet. for Cert. A23-A24, but did not identify the kind of lawless conduct that might be prevented. Nor is the conduct to be deterred apparent from the verdict, which even petitioners acknowledge is "regrettably obtuse." Such a judgment cannot deter misconduct any more than a bolt of lightning can; its results might be devastating, but it teaches no valuable lesson because it carries no discernable meaning. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chicano Police Officer's Assn. v. Stover</span>, 624 F.2d 127, 131 (CA10 1980) (nuisance settlement that does not promote any public purpose cannot support award of attorney's fees), cited and quoted in <span class="Italic">Garland, supra</span>, 489 U.S., at 792, 109 S. Ct., at 1493.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the relevant indicia of success--the extent of relief, the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed, and the public purpose served--all point to a single conclusion: Joseph Farrar achieved only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> victory. As the Court correctly holds today, the appropriate fee in such a case is no fee at all. Because the Court of Appeals gave Joseph Farrar everything he deserved--nothing--I join the Court's opinion affirming the judgment below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Applying the <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> doctrine, the Commission has found that proof of any violation of Title VII serves the public interest and, thus, satisfies the third prong of Justice O'Connor's test. In <span class="Italic">Bragg v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01945699 (1996), the agency argued that the appellant was not entitled to fees because he only succeeded in getting a new position description and some appraisals issued. Overall, appellant sought reinstatement to his former position, a work environment free of harassment and compensatory damages. However, the appellant had not succeeded on those claims. After determining that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Bragg</span> was a prevailing party because the legal relationship of the parties had been materially altered, the Commission turned to the three <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> factors to determine the reasonableness of the fee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Court stated that, "Once civil rights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between the parties, 'the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness' of a fee award."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 574, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, at 793. The Court found that because an award of nominal damages highlighted the plaintiffs' failure to prove an essential element of their claim for monetary damages, the only reasonable fee was no fee at all. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 575. The Court thus applied the test cited in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> for determining the reasonableness of the award, "the degree of success obtained," to conclude that the plaintiffs were entitled to no fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the plaintiffs sought $17 million in damages for conspiracy to deprive them of their civil rights; while the jury found a deprivation of civil rights, it found no proximate cause and an award of only $1.00 was ultimately granted. In her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, Justice O'Connor reiterated the view that the technical nature of the victory goes not to the prevailing party inquiry, but to the determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee. She suggested that there are three factors to be considered in determining whether a victory is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, technical. The three factors are: (1) the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought; (2) the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed; and (3) the public purpose served by the litigation. <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, at 578-579. These three factors were applied in a recent Seventh Circuit case where the court noted that the first factor is the most important of the three, and the second factor is the least weighty. <span class="Italic">Cartwright v. Stamper</span>, 7 F.3d 106 (7th Cir. 1993). In its discussion of the public purpose factor, the court in <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span> held that the more important the right at stake and the more egregious the violation, the more likely it is that a public purpose is served. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 110. In <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span>, after consideration of all three factors, the court 'held that the victory was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, and therefore awarded no fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this analysis to the unique set of facts presented in this case, the Commission finds that appellant is a prevailing party. As noted above, in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Court stressed that a judgment which materially alters the legal relationship between the parties is the touchstone for prevailing party status. It is clear in this case that a finding of discrimination was made by the agency. <span class="Italic">Bragg II, supra</span>. Moreover, the Commission notes that this finding of discrimination materially altered the legal relationship between the parties. Because of this finding, the agency was required to prepare and issue a position description and appraisals. Even the agency concedes that appellant is a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that appellant is a prevailing party, the inquiry turns to the second prong of the analysis, determining the reasonableness of the fee award. Similar to the court in <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span>, the Commission applies the three factors set forth in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> to assess the reasonableness of a fee award in this case. <span class="Italic">See Lopez, supra; Thomas v. Department of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932717 (June 10, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first factor, an examination of the judgment recovered and the recovery sought is made. The Commission agrees with the agency that appellant in this case primarily sought reinstatement to his prior position and a work environment free of discriminatory harassment as well as other appropriate relief, including compensatory damages. Given that this factor is weighted most heavily, the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought appears to weigh in favor of classifying the success in this case as <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. However, appellant did specifically seek to compel the agency to issue his position <span id="Page_1992"></span>description and appraisals. While appellant also sought reinstatement, he nonetheless achieved all permissible relief with respect to allegation g. This is a significant difference between appellant and the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, who failed to prove an essential element of their claim for relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second factor involves the significance of the legal issue on which appellant prevailed. Appellant correctly points out that a finding was made that the agency violated Title VII by denying him a position description and appraisals. This factor therefore suggests that the success in this case was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>; however, this factor is least weighty in classifying the victory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the third factor considers the public purpose served. As noted by Justice O'Connor, "success might be considered material if it also accomplished some public goal other than occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client." <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, at 578. The Commission finds that this case served a public purpose. In this regard, any violation of Title VII detracts from the goal of eradicating discrimination from the workforce, and therefore should be considered serious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission is not persuaded under the specific facts of this matter that no award of attorney's fees is required under a <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> analysis. Under the agency's arguments, in any case where compensatory damages were unavailable, a complainant would be essentially foreclosed from seeking legal representation with respect to allegations which do not concern backpay or similar monetary relief. Therefore, the Commission finds that this matter is one that requires a reduction of fees rather than an award of no fees at all.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission then addressed the fee to be awarded.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the Commission limited <span class="Italic">Bragg</span> to the specific facts of that case. While it found that proving any violation of Title VII serves a public purpose, it has left the door open to the possibility that no fee award could be a reasonable fee award under other circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commissions the fee award of an administrative judge on appeal, it will grant deference to the findings of the judge and "will disturb such an award only for mistake of law or abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060031 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not appropriate for the administrative judge to simply set the amount of a fee award without regard to the lodestar. In <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120061020 (2008), the administrative judge found that the agency had failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant, but also found that the agency had engaged in good faith accommodation efforts and that the complainant, as a result, was not entitled to compensatory damages. Without regard to the lodestar and without allowing the complainant to submit a fee petition, the judge determined that $7,500 was the reasonable fee under the circumstances. The Commission upheld the judge's findings on denial of reasonable accommodation and the agency's good faith effort, but struck down the award of attorney fees in <span class="Italic">Jimenez</span> explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances, we find, as did the AJ, that complainant is a prevailing party and he may recover attorney's fees expended for this effort. <span class="Italic">See Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,</span> 532 U.S. 598 (2001). A prevailing party for this purpose is one who succeeds on any significant issue, and achieves some of the benefit sought in bringing the action. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970101 (February 4, 1999) (<span class="Italic">citing Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 427, 433 (1983)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of attorney's fees is determined by calculating the lodestar, i.e., by multiplying a reasonable hourly fee times a reasonable number of hours expended. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424 (1983); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B). "There is a strong presumption that this amount represents the reasonable fee." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B). A reasonable hourly fee is the prevailing market rate in the relevant community. <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson,</span> 465 U.S. 886 (1984). A petition for fees and costs must take the form of the verified statement required by the Commission's regulations at 29 C.F.R. 1614.501(e)(2)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to attorney's fees, we find it was not appropriate in the instant circumstance, for the AJ to depart from lodestar formula, in which the hours expended multiplied by the prevailing hourly rate for similarly experienced attorneys practicing in the relevant community in similar cases, adjusted as necessary to reflect the degree of success achieved is presumed to yield a reasonable attorney's fee. We find no evidence in the record to indicate that the sum awarded by the AJ represents a reasonable fee. There is no indication that the AJ ever considered a fee petition. There is also no indication that either the AJ or the agency provided complainant with the opportunity to submit a fee petition prior to the AJ's decision awarding fees. We find that the AJ should have given complainant the opportunity to submit a fee petition and then the AJ should have considered such a fee petition. Therefore, we shall remand the matter so that the agency can give complainant the opportunity to submit a petition for attorney's fees. If complainant timely submits a fee petition, then the agency shall award such fees pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e).</p>
