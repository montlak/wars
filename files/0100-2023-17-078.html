<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-78"><span class="space">E.</span> ATTORNEY FEES AS SANCTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">As discussed in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-15-001.html#sec6-1">6</a> and <a href="0100-2023-31-001.html#sec22-1">22</a>, the Commission has used attorney fees as a sanction for dilatory discovery conduct, finding that it has the authority to award such fees, regardless of whether the complainant is the prevailing party. As explained fully in Chapter 6 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-15-123.html#sec6-121">Justice Memo Halting Fees as Sanctions</a>," in January 2003, the EEOC suspended the use of fees as a sanction following the issuance of a memorandum by the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, that the Commission lacked the authority to impose fees as a sanction. For several years, the Commission considered what, if any, challenge should be made to the Justice Department opinion. That answer finally came in 2007 when the Commission issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Waller v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720030069 (2007). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Waller</span>, rejected the rationale of the Justice Department memorandum and reinstated awards of attorney fees as a sanction. See discussion in Chapter 6, subsection on "<a href="0100-2023-15-124.html#sec6-122">Reinstatement of Fees as Sanction</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the issuance of the Justice memo, in <span class="Italic">Ortega v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956818 (1998), the Commission gave some indication that, in such cases, fees are a more favored sanction than an adverse inference:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented is whether the administrative judge properly sanctioned the agency for its course of conduct during discovery by drawing an adverse inference against the agency on the ultimate issue of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 19, 1995, the AJ issued a Show Cause Order informing the parties that he would grant appellant's request for an adverse inference to be drawn, but that he was undecided as to what the scope the inference should be. The AJ indicated that his decision was influenced by his inability to award appellant attorney fees for discovery matters unless appellant were a "prevailing party" with regard to his discrimination complaint. The AJ afforded the agency 15 days in which to show cause as to why he should not issue a decision in appellant's favor as to the ultimate issue of discrimination. On May 25, 1995, Mr. Alley informed Ms. Woodard that he was unable to go forward with AW Medina's deposition on June 1 or 2, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 1, 1995, Ms. Woodard filed another motion to compel regarding the agency's continuing failure to respond to certain interrogatories/requests and to establish dates for the taking of depositions. The agency argues on appeal that this motion was premature, in that its time to respond to the Show Cause Order had not yet expired. On June 5, 1995, the agency responded to the Show Cause Order, essentially arguing that it did not understand the AJ's March 21, 1995, order to "mandate a waiver" of its discovery objections, and that it had made, and continued to make, good faith efforts to respond to discovery requests and to schedule depositions. On June 23, 1995, the agency responded to appellant's latest motion to compel, indicating that it intended to produce requested documents, but did not at that point produce them. On June 26, 1995, Ms. Woodard filed a reply to the agency's response, reiterating continuing difficulties in establishing dates for depositions to be taken. On June 30, 1995, the agency further responded to the motion with regard to the deposition of AW Medina. Also on that date, however, the AJ issued a recommended decision (RD) in which he drew an adverse inference against the agency and found discrimination. The AJ found that the agency had engaged in abusive discovery practices and had ignored his orders. The AJ noted again that appellant could not receive attorney fees unless he were a prevailing party, and indicated his concern in this regard that appellant not "be at the mercy of abusive [a]gency practices."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record in this case, the Commission concludes that the AJ did not abuse his discretion to sanction the agency for its failure to cooperate in discovery and, more specifically, to comply with his discovery order. That, however, is not the end of the Commission's inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ plainly indicated that the scope of the sanction he imposed was influenced by his inability to grant appellant attorney fees for the legal services necessitated by the agency's failure to cooperate in discovery proceedings. However, just prior to the issuance of the RD in this case, the Commission issued a decision holding that, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3). A complainant may be awarded interim attorney fees as a sanction even where he or she is unsuccessful on the ultimate issue of discrimination<span class="Italic">. Stull v. Dept. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941582 (June 15, 1995). Given the short time by which the decision in<span class="Italic"> Stull</span> preceded the RD, and the AJ's pointed remarks regarding his desire to have awarded attorney fees as a sanction, the Commission concludes that the AJ was unaware that he had the authority to do so. The Commission further concludes that, had the AJ been aware that he had the authority to award attorney fees as a sanction, more likely than not he would have done so in lieu of issuing an RD finding discrimination. Accordingly, the Commission finds it appropriate to modify the sanction imposed by the AJ. Rather than draw an adverse inference and issue a finding of discrimination, the Commission will order the agency to pay appellant's reasonable attorney fees and costs associated with Ms. Woodard's efforts to secure discovery compliance, commencing with the March 8, 1995, motion to compel discovery and concluding with her efforts in connection with this appeal. The Commission further finds it appropriate to remand the case for the administrative hearing which appellant thus far has been denied.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01986987 (2001) (imposing attorney fees as a sanction for agency failure to cooperate during complaint investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Clark v. Secretary of Army</span>, 07A10078 (2003), the Commission overturned the award of costs to the complainant as a sanction against the agency for failure to produce a witness at the hearing. Although referencing the Justice Department memorandum and acknowledging the agency's argument that the award of costs violated the principle for sovereign immunity, the Commission instead reversed the sanction on the basis that the complainant had not demonstrated that he incurred any costs as a result of the agency's conduct. In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the AJ found that a sanction against the agency was appropriate. Specifically, the AJ noted that on June 30, 1999, she issued a letter of confirmed witnesses for the hearing. Despite this, one of the complainant's witnesses, who was employed by the agency in the Netherlands at the time of the hearing, failed to appear at the hearing in Korea. The AJ also noted that the witness failed to notify the agency's EEO office that he was unable to attend the hearing. Thereafter, the hearing was adjourned and the parties agreed to take the witnesses' testimony telephonically at a later date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 19, 1999, the AJ reconvened the hearing and participated by telephone at approximately 11:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Pacific Standard Time since the complainant was stationed in Europe at the time. Furthermore, the AJ noted that the court reporter and agency representative were in Seoul, Korea at the time. The AJ noted that after two attempts to contact the witness at his work number, an individual at the witness' office reported that the witness refused to come to the phone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the agency's failure to ensure the presence of an agency employee at the hearing, the AJ determined it was appropriate to sanction the agency for its conduct. In determining the most appropriate sanction, the AJ noted that she had provided the agency with an opportunity to show good cause why sanctions should not be imposed. However, the agency failed to submit an affidavit explaining good cause why sanctions should not be imposed. Notably, however, the AJ did convey that the agency's representative had gone to "Herculean" efforts to secure the witness. Hearing Transcript, at p. 190.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ initially suggested that it would be appropriate to take an adverse inference against the agency. In response, the agency representative argued that it was her understanding that the witness did wish to testify, and objected to the adverse inference until the witness provided a reason for his failure to testify. The AJ determined that the witness played no role in the agency's decision to deny complainant's extension. Furthermore, although the witness may have been able to testify to the agency discrimination when it denied complainant the detail, the AJ found little evidence of any damages that complainant could recover, if he successfully proved he was discriminated against when he was denied the detail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the AJ determined that although complainant was not represented by an attorney during the proceedings, it was appropriate to issue a monetary sanction against the agency for the witness's "blatant contempt of the EEO proceedings." In doing so, the AJ relied on 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3)(v). The AJ found that a strong sanctions should <span id="Page_615"></span>be imposed against the agency so that the agency would "instruct its employees about the mandatory nature of an EEOC hearing appearance and to discipline them for failing to so appear." Furthermore, the AJ noted that complainant was inconvenienced when he was required to take the witness's testimony by telephone on August 19, 1999, and when he had to include the issue in his closing arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's final order rejected the AJ's decision. On appeal, the agency argues that the AJ erred by awarding a monetary sanction against the agency, since Congress has not waived sovereign immunity for monetary sanctions. The agency argued that this sanction can either be viewed as punitive damage, or as compensatory damages during an EEO proceeding, both of which are unavailable to complainant. Furthermore, the agency states that any monetary sanction that can be taken against the agency must be for actual costs incurred, as in the case of attorney's fees. Here, however, complainant failed to submit any statement or proof of costs. In response to the agency's appeal, complainant appeals the AJ's finding of no discrimination, as well as the dollar amount of the sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a), all post-hearing factual findings by an AJ will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence is defined as "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951) (citation omitted). A finding regarding whether or not discriminatory intent existed is a factual finding<span class="Italic">. See Pullman Standard Co. v. Swint</span>, 456 U.S. 273, 293 (1982). An AJ's conclusions of law are subject to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review, whether or not a hearing was held.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we discern no basis to disturb the AJ's finding of no discrimination. The findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and the AJ correctly applied the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission disagrees, however, with the form of the AJ's sanction in this case. An AJ has the authority to sanction either party for failure without good cause shown to fully comply with an order. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3); EEOC Management Directive 110 Chapter 7, pp. 9-10 (1999). Such sanctions may include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, such sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned<span class="Italic">. See Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, 01A03341 (December 8, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we understand the AJ's frustration in this situation, we find the particular sanction imposed to be inappropriate because, among other things, there is no evidence in the record that complainant incurred any costs. Furthermore, the AJ failed to provide any evidentiary support that complainant expended $1,000 because of the agency's failure to secure an approved witness. Rather, the AJ found support for the sanction because complainant was inconvenienced in that he had to make special arrangements for the telephone call, and because he referenced the matter in his written closing argument. We note that the telephone call was meant to take the hearing testimony of two witnesses, one of whom did in fact testify. Also, we are unable to discern from complainant's closing argument the costs complainant incurred because of his work on his closing argument. Thus, we are unable to concur with the AJ's decision to order the agency to pay complainant $1,000 as a sanction for the agency's failure to secure a witness for the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having said that, we do not mean to diminish the agency's fault in failing to stress the importance of EEO proceedings to its employees. We also note the wasted efforts of the Commission's AJ in seeking to carry out her responsibilities to secure the testimony of the witnesses, as identified by complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ that some form of sanction is appropriate for the agency's failure to secure the witness' appearance. Given the facts stated above, we find that a more appropriate sanction in this case would be to order the agency to investigate the conduct of the recalcitrant witness in this matter, afford appropriate training to the individuals involved and to consider disciplinary action. Accordingly, we modify the AJ's decision, and direct the agency to comply with the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0720140016 (2014), the Commission upheld an award of $3,995 in fees where the complainant's attorney noticed the deposition of several agencies employees for dates in September. The agency representative stated that not all of the witnesses would be available on those dates and suggested dates later in September but did not advise the complainant's attorney that the selectee, who was a temporary employee, was end his employment with the agency between the two dates. The agency representative admitted that he knew at the time he asked to reschedule the depositions that the selectee's employment would be terminated by those dates. The Commission found that 9.4 hours at the rate of $425 per hour was reasonable to cover the time involved in research and preparing the sanction motion, and preparing for and traveling to the deposition.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070020 (2010), the Commission did not award fees as a sanction, but did enhance an attorney fee award by $1,000 as the result of management interference with witnesses when a management official refused to revise schedules to accommodate witnesses, told witnesses they would not be paid for their time and that they would go to jail if they lied. The decision contains no explanation as to why the Commission treated this as a fee enhancement as opposed to a sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the complainant's failure to prevail on the merits of the case, the Commission <span class="Italic">Emelda F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720170024 (2017), awarded as sanctions the additional attorney fees incurred by the complainant when the agency delayed processing her complaint by five months.</p>
