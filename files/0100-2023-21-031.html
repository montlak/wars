<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-30"><span class="space">1.</span> Consensual Conduct</h4>
<p class="noindent">As should be clear from the above sections, consent is a defense to allegations of sexual harassment because the conduct, if consensual, would not be unwelcome. In <span class="Italic">Cramer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911530 (1991), the Commission, however, was presented with the unusual allegation that the complainant's wife and an agency supervisor engaged in sexual relations, and this constituted sexual harassment directed toward the spurned husband, where all three were federal employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that a consensual sexual relationship between the spouse of a federal employee and a third party, where all three parties are employed by the same federal agency, does not constitute sexual harassment. Such conduct on the part of the spouse and the third party cannot be said to be harassment directed at appellant due to his sex. The motives of the spouse and the third party in a consenting relationship are not related to appellant's membership in a protected class. The objected-to conduct between appellant's spouse and the third party is not directed at appellant because he is a male, thus, appellant is unable to prove the second element of his sexual harassment claim.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that the Administrative Judge, in finding sexual harassment, improperly construed EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1604.11 using a state statute. In his decision, the Administrative Judge construed the federal regulation defining sexual harassment by applying Section 765.001(2) of the Wisconsin statutes which articulates the state public policy interest in the preservation of marriage. We find this to be error, first, because of the use of a state statute to construe federal law, and second, because the goals behind the Wisconsin statute and Title VII are wholly distinct.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Further, we do not find that in this case there is a sex-related conduct directed at appellant. In this case, the acts of alleged harassment, that is, the verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, is directed between appellant's spouse and the third party. Nor has there been any showing that the relationship between appellant's spouse and the third party is part of an ongoing pattern of intense abuse directed at appellant as a result of his sex. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. Gus Construction Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 101 (8th Cir. 1988) (ongoing pattern of cruel remarks and sabotage treated as sexual harassment); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987) (threats and verbal abuse treated as sexual harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the only surprising thing about this decision is that the administrative judge managed to find sexual harassment had occurred. The Commission reaffirmed its position that a consensual relationship between a complainant's spouse and another federal employee does not aggrieve the complainant for purposes of stating a claim for relief in <span class="Italic">Mandel v. Attorney General</span>, 01A11706 (2001). Apparently, such situations are not quite as rare as the author oriGINAlly thought. The Commission had the opportunity to affirm its position once again in <span class="Italic">Shoup v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A32721 (2003), with the additional notation that comments and remarks made by coworkers about the situation did not rise to the level of creating a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges sexual harassment and the agency contends the relationship was consensual, the administrative judge may consider the credibility of the respective witnesses, as well as extrinsic evidence, in evaluating the competing claims. In <span class="Italic">Maruri v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932851 (1994), the Commission, reviewing the totality of the evidence, concluded that any relationship was consensual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the evidence of record does not support a finding of "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" sexual harassment or a hostile work environment. We reach this decision by considering the following. The AJ did not find the testimony of some of the witnesses credible. In this regard the AJ noted that appellant's testimony contained a number of major inconsistencies and incongruities. The AJ noted the difference between the supervisor allegedly harassing appellant about her work performance yet spending an inordinate amount of time with her on breaks, lunches, waiting for her to clock out and rubbing up against her on the workroom floor. We agree with the AJ that too many facts support a conclusion that appellant was not being harassed but was engaged in a consensual relationship with her supervisor. As the AJ noted, appellant claimed she lent the supervisor $8,300, bought him a bed, and a leather jacket, and opened a joint credit account because she was afraid of losing her $28,721 mail processor job which she testified she needed for the support of her two sons in light of her recent divorce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant testified that when she refused the supervisor's request for sex he stated that in that case she could lend him money. It is incongruous that appellant would discuss her personal finances with a person that she was allegedly afraid of to such a degree that he would know that she had the wherewithal to borrow a large sum of money. The AJ found this portion of appellant's testimony implausible, and we agree. This conclusion is supported by the fact that appellant continued to lend larger and larger sums of money to the supervisor without ever pursuing, beyond her initial inquiry, her rights with the union steward. We further find incredible appellant's testimony regarding her visits to the supervisor's home for coffee, to watch a video, and help construct the bed frame and accepting weekend trips because he asked and she was ostensibly afraid of losing her job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to inconsistencies, most notable is appellant's failure to raise the rape incident before the hearing in the instant matter. In her affidavit, appellant described the incidents where the supervisor grabbed her arm or knee during their car pooling. However, appellant added the rape and physical abuse incident at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the witnesses who observed the interaction of appellant and the supervisor on the workroom floor, the witnesses added very little in determining whether appellant was, in fact, being harassed by the supervisor. For example, appellant, when pressed about how she received the bruises, admitted to the two female witnesses that she received them from the supervisor but appellant failed to tell either individual about the purported rape. Both individuals merely suggested that appellant stay away from the supervisor. As noted above one of the female witnesses and the male witnesses have reason to be biased against the supervisor by virtue of the disciplinary actions he took against them respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the supervisor's former girlfriend's friend (co-worker of appellant) the AJ found this witness testimony regarding the context of the conversation with appellant about being involved with the supervisor as well as her unwillingness to give categorical answers when she was not certain to be more credible than the other witnesses mentioned above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the supervisor, the AJ stated that it was not entirely credible that appellant volunteered all of the money that was transacted between the two of them. However, the AJ noted that the supervisor described one loan and one more gift than appellant recounted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that another witness would have testified in accordance with a note she wrote in which she stated that appellant told her that she (appellant) lent the supervisor $5,000 when they were living together.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the credibility determinations made by the AJ in the instant matter we note that in an administrative hearing where the motivation and credibility of witnesses are critical, the conclusions of the hearing officer are entitled to great weight unless there is substantial evidence in the record to support a contrary assessment<span class="Italic">. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 340 U.S. 474 (1951). Therefore, the Commission defers to the AJ's credibility determinations with regard to appellant's and the other witnesses testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Geoghagan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A41364 (2005), where the Commission relied heavily upon the observations of coworkers in determining the conduct was not unwelcome:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested EEO counseling on May 16, 2002, alleging that for approximately 18 months she had been subjected to sexual harassment by her supervisor. Complainant claimed, among a number of things, that the supervisor continually made improper remarks, kissed her once while she was performing her delivery duties in the mail room, gave her an improper gift of lingerie, patted her on the buttocks, grabbed her hand and placed it on his groin area, and e-mailed her sexually explicit messages, including pictures of him naked. For his part, supervisor admitted that he had done many of the things claimed by complainant. However, supervisor claimed that complainant welcomed all of his actions, and never complained to him or requested that he stop. The Postal Inspection service conducted an investigation of this matter, and as a result thereof, the agency concluded that complainant was not truthful and had engaged in conduct of an obnoxious and offensive nature. Thereafter, complainant was issued the Notice of Removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The investigative record supports a finding that the conduct in question was not unwelcome. The overwhelming majority of testimonial evidence presented by complainant's coworkers casts serious doubt on the veracity of her allegations. A number of witnesses indicated that during the time period in question, complainant was always in supervisor's office, laughing, joking, and at least on one occasion, propping her feet up on supervisor's desk. Witnesses further indicated that complainant was willingly flirtatious with her supervisor. One coworker indicated that he witnessed complainant touching supervisor in the groin area. <span id="Page_831"></span>A number of witnesses testified that complainant consistently engaged in sexual discussions and used vulgar and crude language in the work place. There was also testimony indicating that complainant touched male coworkers on the buttocks.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant engages in sexual banter and initiates that banter any resulting conduct of a similar nature is not unwelcome. <span class="Italic">Shuler v. Attorney General</span>, 01A42521 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible that conduct that was at one time consensual becomes unwelcome. However, in such a case, the alleged victim has a duty to clearly put the other party on notice that the conduct is no longer welcome. In <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120064427 (2008), the complainant engaged in a series of sexually explicit emails with a coworker with whom he was having an extramarital affair. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Peterson</span>, found that the conduct was not unwelcome explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's decision without a hearing was appropriate, as no genuine issue of material fact is in dispute and the record was adequately developed. We agree with the AJ's finding that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment. Specifically, we agree that complainant failed to establish that the conduct in question was unwelcome. The evidence shows that complainant voluntarily participated in the conduct in question. In fact, the record reflects that complainant received and sent at least twenty e-mails from and to MA with sexual tones and personal communications. Moreover, we find that complainant failed to demonstrate that he made it sufficiently clear to JLA that he objected to receiving subsequent e-mails or objected to JLA's sexual conduct. According to Commission policy, if an employee participated in a sexual conduct and then later objected, he has the burden of showing that he clearly notified the alleged harasser that further sexual conduct is unwelcome. Particularly when the alleged harasser may have some reason (e.g., prior consensual relationship) to believe that the advances will be welcomed, it is important for the victim to communicate that the conduct is unwelcome. EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment No. 915.050 at p.98. (3/19/90). <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. Department of the Air Force,</span> UDC Appeal No. 01A42809 (August 23, 2004).<span class="Italic"> See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999? ("<span class="Italic">Vicarious Liability Guidance</span>"), at 12 (<span class="Italic">citing Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</span> 524 VS. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275 (1998)). In this case, complainant has the burden of demonstrating that when he became offended by JLA's conduct or statements, he clearly communicated that her conduct was no longer welcome. The records shows e-mails sent by complainant to JLA, the latest one in or about October 2003, approximately three months before he filed the instant complaint, in which he continued to send JLA romantic and flirtatious e-mails. There is no indication in any of the e-mails (more than twenty) between both of them, that complainant communicated to JLA that her conduct was not welcome. Moreover, the e-mails reflect that complainant participated in and in some instances initiated sexually-oriented conversations with JLA. Accordingly, we conclude that complainant failed to show a claim of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120110761 (2013), the Commission noted that the fact that there had previously been a consensual relationship could affect whether subsequent conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive. In that case, the complainant had previously had a consensual relationship with a coworker who left her a few notes and made what the Commission described as a few vulgar and jealous comments about the complainant. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the error was harmless because given the context of their prior romantic involvement, BM's conduct towards Complainant was neither sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. BM's notes and comments were both limited in number and not persuasively threatening such that a reasonable person, in Complainant's position would have found then to be abusive. The fact that Complainant, in her long email to the Chief Mate complaining about CW, never once mentioned BM or his behavior and did not mention it until after her removal was proposed, supports this conclusion. The record also contains persuasive evidence that Complainant herself engaged in inappropriate conduct towards BM. Further, the AJ found Complainant's testimony during the hearing to be on more than one occasion, "unconnected to a concern for the truth."</p>
<p class="noindent">"Where two coworkers engage in a consensual sexual relationship, disciplining the female employee more harshly than the male employee for the same conduct will support a claim of sex discrimination." <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130039 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent">Sexual favoritism due to a consensual relationship can create a hostile environment for others affected by the favoritism. However, such cases are subject to the severe or pervasive requirement. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Dietz v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A52542 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's allegation of sexual harassment is premised on his claim that E1 was treated more favorably as a result of a relationship with the Commissioner. The Commission has taken the position that sexual favoritism in the workplace which adversely affects the employment opportunities of third parties may, under certain circumstances, constitute sexual harassment prohibited by Title VII.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC's Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism, Notice No. N-915-048 (January 12, 1990). However, the Commission's position on this issue is clear that Title VII does not prohibit isolated instances of preferential treatment based upon consensual romantic relationships<span class="Italic">.
