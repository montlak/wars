<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-93"><span class="space">2.</span> Request for Accommodation</h4>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to its liberal position on what constitutes a request for reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, see <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a>, a request for religious accommodation must be more specific. In <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 02970019 (1999), the Commission rejected a claim of failure to make religious accommodation because the complainant's request did not sufficiently put the agency on notice that it was an accommodation request. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The assertion in his oriGINAl request that the compressed schedule would "allow him more time to devote to his Family and Church" is too vague to put the employer on notice that he was requesting a religious accommodation. The statement in his grievance that the agency was denying him "the right to pursue his work with his church and devote more time to his family" also did not adequately encompass the elements required to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. At no time did appellant inform the agency what <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief conflicted with his being able to work his usual schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the employee need not specifically request "accommodation" or reference Title VII. The Compliance Manual, as Section 12-IV, A, 1, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers need not provide an accommodation unless they are on notice that one is needed for religious purposes. Typically, the employer will advise the applicant or employee of its policies or a particular work requirement, and in response the applicant or employee will indicate that an accommodation is needed for religious reasons. In some instances, even absent an applicant's or employee's request, the employer will be on notice that the observance or practice is religious and conflicts with a work policy, and therefore that accommodation is or could be needed. In such circumstances, it would violate Title VII for an employer to fail to provide a reasonable accommodation unless it proves that doing so would pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, even in the absence of any notice that a religious accommodation is needed, an employer violates Title VII if it takes an adverse action against an applicant or employee (such as failing to hire) based on its belief that the applicant or employee might need a reasonable religious accommodation, unless the employer proves that such an accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When requesting accommodation, the applicant or employee need not use any "magic words," such as "religious accommodation" or "Title VII." The employer must have enough information to make the employer aware that there exists a conflict between the applicant's or employee's religious observance, practice, or belief and a requirement for applying for or performing the job. If the employer reasonably needs more information, the employer and the applicant or employee should discuss the request. The applicant or employee may need to explain the religious nature of <span id="Page_1053"></span>the belief, observance, or practice at issue, and cannot assume that the employer will already know or understand it. Similarly, the employer should not assume that a request is invalid simply because it is based on religious beliefs or practices with which the employer is unfamiliar, but should ask the applicant or employee to explain the religious nature of the practice and the way in which it conflicts with a work requirement. In determining if a conflict exists, it is irrelevant that the employer does not view the work requirement as implicating a religious belief, or that most people of the applicant's or employee's faith would not; it is the applicant's or employee's own religious beliefs that are relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 30--Failure to Advise Employer That Request Is Due to Religious Practice or Belief</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Jim agreed to take his employer's drug test but was terminated because he refused to sign the accompanying consent form. After his termination, Jim filed a charge alleging that the employer failed to accommodate his religious objection to swearing an oath. Until it received notice of the charge, the employer did not know that Jim's refusal to sign the form was based on his religious beliefs. Because the employer was not notified of the conflict at the time Jim refused to sign the form, or at any time prior to Jim's termination, it did not have an opportunity to offer to accommodate him. The employer has not violated Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission does not use the same terminology to describe it, the Commission does envision that once a request for accommodation is made that the agency and the employee will engage in an "interactive discussion" to determine if an accommodation can be granted without imposing an undue hardship. The Commission, at Section 12-IV, A, 2, of its Compliance Manual, further explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although an employer is not required by Title VII to conduct a discussion with an employee before making a determination on an accommodation request, as a practical matter it can be important to do so. Both the employer and the employee have roles to play in resolving an accommodation request. In addition to placing the employer on notice of the need for accommodation, the employee should cooperate with the employer's efforts to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be granted. Once the employer becomes aware of the employee's religious conflict, the employer should obtain promptly whatever additional information is needed to determine whether a reasonable accommodation is available without posing an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. This typically involves the employer and employee mutually sharing information necessary to process the accommodation request. Employer employee cooperation and flexibility are key to the search for a reasonable accommodation. If the accommodation solution is not immediately apparent, the employer should discuss the request with the employee to determine what accommodations might be effective. If the employer requests additional information reasonably needed to evaluate the request, the employee should provide it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Failure to confer with the employee is not an independent violation of Title VII. But as a practical matter, such failure can have adverse legal consequences. For example, in some cases where an employer has made no effort to act on an accommodation request, courts have found that the employer lacked the evidence needed to meet its burden of proof to establish that the plaintiff's proposed accommodation would actually have posed an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, employees should cooperate with an employer's requests for reasonable information. For example, if an employee requested a schedule change to accommodate daily prayers, the employer might need to ask for information about the religious observance, such as the time and duration of the daily prayers, in order to determine if accommodation can be granted without posing an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Moreover, even if the employer does not grant the employee's preferred accommodation but instead provides a reasonable alternative accommodation, the employee must cooperate by attempting to meet his religious needs through the employer's proposed accommodation if possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the accommodation request itself does not provide enough information to enable the employer to make a determination, and the employer has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> doubt as to the basis for the accommodation request, it is entitled to make a limited inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the employee's claim that the belief or practice at issue is religious and sincerely held, and that the belief or practice gives rise to the need for the accommodation. Whether an employer has a reasonable basis for seeking to verify the employee's stated beliefs will depend on the facts of a particular case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 31--Sincerity of Religious Belief Questioned</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bob, who had been a dues-paying member of the CDF union for fourteen years, had a work-related dispute with a union official and one week later asserted that union activities were contrary to his religion and that he could no longer pay union dues. The union doubted whether Bob's request was based on a sincerely held religious belief, given that it appeared to be precipitated by an unrelated dispute with the union, and he had not sought this accommodation in his prior fourteen years of employment. In this situation, the union can require him to provide additional information to support his assertion that he sincerely holds a religious conviction that precludes him from belonging to--or financially supporting--a union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employer requests additional information, employees should provide information that addresses the employer's reasonable doubts. That information need not, however, take any specific form. For example, written materials or the employee's own first-hand explanation may be sufficient to alleviate the employer's doubts about the sincerity or religious nature of the employee's professed belief such that third-party verification is unnecessary. Further, since idiosyncratic beliefs can be sincerely held and religious, even when third-party verification is requested, it does not have to come from a clergy member or fellow congregant, but rather could be provided by others who are aware of the employee's religious practice or belief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer's reasonable request for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation. By the same token, employers who unreasonably request unnecessary or excessive corroborating evidence risk being held liable for denying a reasonable accommodation request, and having their actions challenged as retaliatory or as part of a pattern of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 32--Clarifying a Request</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Diane requests that her employer schedule her for "fewer hours" so that she can "attend church more frequently." The employer denies the request because it is not clear what schedule Diane is requesting or whether the change is sought due to a religious belief or practice. While Diane's request lacked sufficient detail for the employer to make a final decision, it was sufficient to constitute a religious accommodation request. Rather than denying the request outright, the employer should have obtained the information from Diane that it needed to make a decision. The employer could have inquired of Diane precisely what schedule change was sought and for what purpose, and how her current schedule conflicted with her religious practices or beliefs. Diane would then have had an obligation to provide sufficient information to permit her employer to make a reasonable assessment of whether her request was based on a sincerely held religious belief, the precise conflict that existed between her work schedule and church schedule, and whether granting an accommodation would pose an undue hardship on the employer's business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC's position has been that an employee need not specifically inform the employer of his or her religious beliefs and the need for accommodation if the employer is otherwise aware of the religious belief and a conflict with work practices. In <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch Stores, Inc</span>., 731 F.3d 1106 (10th Cir. 2013), the court rejected that argument in a case involving the failure to hire a young Muslim woman who wore a black headscarf. The scarf violated the company's policy that all floor employees must dress consistent with Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch styles and not wear black clothing or caps, although the policy does not specifically describe a cap. The Tenth Circuit reversed a grant of summary judgment for the EEOC and granted summary judgment for Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch finding the woman had never specifically informed the company that she wore a headscarf for religious reasons. The Supreme Court found that knowledge is not a specific requirement of accommodation cases in <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch Stores, Inc</span>., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20150601c53">135 S. Ct. 2028</a> (2015). See discussion above in section on "<a href="0100-2023-13-019.html#sec4-19">Prima Facie Case</a>" and in Chapter 10 in section on "<a href="0100-2023-21-009.html#sec12-10">Knowledge of Agency</a>."</p>
