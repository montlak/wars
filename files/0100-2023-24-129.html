<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-109"><span class="space">3.</span> Reassignment Under the ADA</h4>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, with the passage of the Rehabilitation Act Amendment of 1992, Pub. Law No. 102-569, 503(b), 105 Stat. 4344 (1992), the nonaffirmative action requirements of the ADA became applicable to federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 791(g). Reassignment is specifically designated as a form of reasonable accommodation under the ADA. 42 USC 12111(9)(B). The net result is that much of the Commission's prior case law on reassignment as a reasonable accommodation once again applies to federal sector cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's former regulations on reasonable accommodation and reassignment at 29 CFR 1614.203 were not consistent with the requirements of the ADA and the Commission has now amended its regulations to adopt the standards applicable to ADA cases under 29 CFR Part 1630.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission explains its current view of reassignment requirements in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, "Types of Reasonable Accommodation Related to Job Performance, Reassignment":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA specifically lists "reassignment to a vacant position" as a form of reasonable accommodation. This type of reasonable accommodation must be provided to an employee who, because of a disability, can no longer perform the essential functions of his/her current position, with or without reasonable accommodation, unless the employer can show that it would be an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee must be "qualified" for the new position. An employee is "qualified" for a position if s/he: (1) satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position, and (2) can perform the essential functions of the new position, with or without reasonable accommodation. The employee does not need to be the best qualified individual for the position in order to obtain it as a reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no obligation for the employer to assist the individual to become qualified. Thus, the employer does not have to provide training so that the employee acquires necessary skills to take a job. The employer, however, would have to provide an employee with a disability who is being reassigned with any training that is normally provided to anyone hired for or transferred to the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all courts are aligned with the Commission's position that a disabled employee need not be the best qualified individual for the position in order to justify a reassignment. The Eleventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hospital, Inc.,</span> 842 F.3d 1333, 1338-40 (11th Cir. 2016), held that the ADA does not require reassignment without competition of a qualified individual as a reasonable accommodation. In that case, St. Joseph's Hospital demoted the plaintiff, Leokadia Bryk, to the position of Clinical Nurse II in the psychiatric ward for failure to follow hospital procedures. The Eleventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">St. Joseph's</span> set forth the facts pertinent to its holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 21, 2011, shortly after her demotion, the Hospital advised Bryk that she could no longer use the cane in the psychiatric ward as it posed a safety risk. Krista Sikes, Manager of Team Resources, spoke to Bryk and offered her the opportunity to remain employed with the Hospital. The Hospital allowed Bryk 30 days to identify and apply for other positions. Normally, the Hospital did not permit internal candidates to apply for a transfer, unless they had been in their current position for at least six months and had no final written warnings in their record. Bryk met neither criteria. However, the Hospital waived the requirements. The Hospital allowed Bryk to compete with other internal applicants, as opposed to being in the general pool of job applicants. Although the Hospital authorized Bryk to apply through internal channels as an active employee, all of Bryk's job applications were as an external applicant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Team Resources Director Pat Teeuwan told Bryk, "it wasn't their job to get a job for [her]." However, Krista Sikes was available to answer questions and guide Bryk through the process, but she was not charged with reassigning Bryk to another position. Bryk advised Sikes that she was going on vacation for two weeks at the start of the 30-day period and that she would not look at the Hospital's job board until her return. Bryk never came to Sikes with questions about the application process, the website, or the particular details of any position. Bryk did not apply for another position until November 11, 2011--three weeks into her 30-day allowance. The Hospital job board listed over 700 jobs available. Bryk applied for seven positions, three of which she applied for on the last day of the 30-day period and one of which she applied for after her 30-day application period had expired. At summary judgment, the EEOC focused on three of those seven positions as being positions for which Bryk was qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bryk testified that she was limited to certain positions because she had worked only in psychiatric and chemical dependency units during her 21 years with the Hospital. Bryk stated she could not safely work in medical or surgical units. She was not familiar with newer nursing procedures, she had no skills in placing intravenous lines on patients, and she would not be able to work with a cane in fast-paced units. As a nurse in the psychiatric ward, Bryk did not treat patients with medical surgical issues. Patients were admitted to the psychiatric ward only if they had medical clearance. If a psychiatric patient developed a medical condition or needed an intravenous line, the Hospital transferred the patient to the medical surgery unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the expiration of her 30-day application period, the Hospital terminated Bryk on November 21, 2011. She continued to have access to the Hospital's job board, but she only applied for one additional position on December 17, 2011. Had Bryk been further along in the interview process at the 30-day mark, the Hospital would have extended her employment to allow time for the interviewing process</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission urged the Eleventh Circuit to adopt its position regarding reassignments as a reasonable accommodation, arguing that the ADA mandates noncompetitive reassignment for qualified individuals. Relying heavily on the Supreme Court's language in <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 535 US 391 (2002), the Eleventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">St. Joseph's</span> specifically rejected that argument, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1345-47:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue in this appeal is the district court's holding as a matter of law that the ADA does not mandate reassignment without competition. The district court wrote that whether a disabled employee "had to compete with others for the vacant position is one factor, out of many, that the jury may consider regarding the reasonableness of the accommodation." The EEOC appeals, arguing that the ADA mandates noncompetitive reassignment and that had the jury been so instructed, it would not have found that the Hospital acted in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that the ADA does not require reassignment without competition for, or preferential treatment of, the disabled. The ADA provides that, subject to exceptions irrelevant here, an employer must reasonably accommodate a disabled employee. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a), (b)(5)(A). But it does not say how an employer must do that. It offers a non-exhaustive list of accommodations that "may" be reasonable, and one item on the list is "reassignment to a vacant position." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 12111(9)(B) ("The term 'reasonable accommodation' <span class="Italic">may include</span>...reassignment to vacant position.") (emphasis added). The ADA does not say or imply that reassignment is always reasonable. To the contrary, the use of the word "may" implies just the opposite: that reassignment will be reasonable in some circumstances but not in others.[5] <span class="Italic">See May</span>, Merriam-Webster.com, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/may">www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/may</a> (last visited Oct. 28, 2016) ('may" often means "might" or "can"); <span class="Italic">see also Canup v. Chipman-Union, Inc</span>., 123 F.3d 1440, 1442 (11th Cir. 1997) (contrasting "may" and "shall").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Had Congress understood the ADA to mandate reassignment, it could easily have used mandatory language. That it did not do so at least suggests that it did not intend reassignment to be required in all circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa</span>, 539 U.S. 90, 99 (2003) (same analysis in Title VII case). That is particularly true since Congress had no difficulty using mandatory language in other parts of the statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a), (c)(2)(A), (d)(4)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1372"></span>Apart from the ADA's statutory construction, this Court's well-settled ADA precedent holds that "employers are only required to provide 'alternative employment opportunities reasonably available under the employer's existing policies.'" <span class="Italic">Terrell v. USAir</span>, 132 F.3d 621, 627 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273, 289 n.19 (1987)); <span class="Italic">Frazier-White v. Gee</span>, 818 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir. 2016) ("ADA does not require [employers] to reassign [disabled employees] in violation of its governing civil service rules."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Fla. Power &#x0026; Light Co</span>., 205 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 2000) ("The ADA does not require accommodations...that contravene the seniority rights of other employees under a collective bargaining agreement.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Terrell</span>, the Supreme Court created a framework in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. at 406, which guides this analysis. In <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the Supreme Court examined whether a job reassignment request trumps an employer's seniority system. The question presented was whether the "ADA requires an employer to assign a disabled employee to a particular position even though another employee is entitled to that position under the employer's 'established seniority system.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 406. In holding that it did not, the Supreme Court explained that "<span class="Italic">ordinarily</span> the ADA does not require that assignment. Hence, a showing that the assignment would violate the rules of a seniority system warrants summary judgment for the employer--unless there is more." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Defining "more," the Supreme Court added that where a plaintiff presents evidence of special circumstances that "make 'reasonable' a seniority rule exception," that showing would defeat an employer's motion for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 394.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> framework is relevant in cases where a job reassignment (i.e., the requested accommodation) is claimed to violate a disability-neutral rule of the employer. "The first step requires the employee to show that the accommodation is a type that is reasonable in the run of cases. The second step varies...." <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Twp. of Lakewood</span>, 292 F.3d 356, 361 (3d Cir. 2002). If the accommodation is shown to be reasonable in the run of cases, the burden shifts to the employer to show that granting the accommodation would impose an undue hardship under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "On the other hand, if the accommodation is not shown to be reasonable in the run of cases, the employee can still prevail by showing that special circumstances warrant a finding that the accommodation is reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Dunderdale v. United Airlines</span>, 807 F.3d 849, 855 (7th Cir. 2015) (applying <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> and finding it would be unreasonable to require employer to reassign disabled workers in contravention of its seniority system).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case does not involve a seniority system or a civil service system, but a best-qualified applicant policy.[5] Nevertheless, <span class="Italic">Barnett's</span> framework is instructive in this context. Requiring reassignment in violation of an employer's best qualified hiring or transfer policy is not reasonable "in the run of cases." As things generally run, employers operate their businesses for profit, which requires efficiency and good performance. Passing over the best-qualified job applicants in favor of less-qualified ones is not a reasonable way to promote efficiency or good performance. In the case of hospitals, which is this case, the well-being and even the lives of patients can depend on having the best-qualified personnel. Undermining a hospital's best-qualified hiring or transfer policy imposes substantial costs on the hospital and potentially on patients.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Of course, a merit-based selection policy can leave more room for subjectivity, and therefore, can be more susceptible to abuse for discriminatory purposes. But "subjective reasons are not the red-headed stepchildren of proffered...explanations for employment decisions" and "can be just as valid as objective reasons." <span class="Italic">Chapman v. AI Transport</span>, 229 F.3d 1012, 1034 (11th Cir. 2000). The subjective aspects of a best-qualified applicant policy do not prevent an employer from relying on such a policy when choosing between a disabled applicant and a non-disabled one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the ADA only requires an employer allow a disabled person to compete equally with the rest of the world for a vacant position, this Court is cognizant that "the intent of the ADA is that an employer needs only to provide meaningful <span class="Italic">equal</span> employment opportunities," and that "[t]he ADA was never intended to turn nondiscrimination into discrimination" against the nondisabled. <span class="Italic">Terrell</span>, 132 F.3d at 627 (emphasis in original). Consistent with our holding, the Eighth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Huber v. Wal-Mart Stores</span>, 486 F.3d 480, 483 (8th Cir. 2007) also concluded that the ADA "is not an affirmative action statute" and "only requires [the employer] to allow [the disabled employee] to compete for the job, but does not require [the employer] to turn away a superior applicant." <span class="Italic">See also Daugherty v. City of El Paso</span>, 56 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding that the ADA does not require disabled persons be given priority in hiring or reassignment over those who are not disabled.) (modified on other grounds by <span class="Italic">Kapche v. City of San Antonio</span>, 304 F.3d 493, 494 (5th Cir. 2002)).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The EEOC argues that three other circuits have held that reassignment must be without competition in violation of a best-qualified hiring policy, citing <span class="Italic">EEOC v. United Airlines, Inc</span>., 693 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc.,</span> 180 F.3d 1154 (10th Cir. 1999), and <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr</span>., 156 F.3d 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1998). That argument misconstrues those courts' holdings. Instead of actually deciding the issue, the Seventh Circuit remanded it to the district court for decision in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See United Airlines, Inc</span>., 693 F.3d at 764. The Tenth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> was not confronted with an employer's best-qualified applicant policy, or any policy at all; in fact, it noted that "there may be other important employment policies besides protecting rights guaranteed under a collective bargaining agreement that would make it unreasonable to require an employer to reassign a disabled employee to a particular job." <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 180 F.3d at 1175-76. Finally, while the D.C. Circuit's opinion in <span class="Italic">Aka</span> does contain <span class="Italic">dictum</span> rejecting the view that "a disabled employee is never entitled to any more consideration for a vacant position than an ordinary applicant," the court "decline[d] to decide the precise contours of an employer's reassignment obligations" because it did not need to do so and was "[w]ithout briefing or any record on the issue." <span class="Italic">Aka</span>, 156 F.3d at 1304-05.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, this Court concludes that the district court did not err by failing to instruct the jury that the ADA requires reassignment without competition. Accordingly, the Court upholds the district court's ruling that the ADA does not automatically mandate reassignment without competition.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In so holding, the Court notes that just because reassignment to a vacant position in violation of an employer's best-qualified hiring policy is not always required as a reasonable accommodation does not mean it never will be. Consistent with the second step in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, a plaintiff can show that special circumstances warrant a finding that reassignment is a required accommodation under the particular facts of her case. <span class="Italic">See Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. at 405-06. Bryk did not show special circumstances in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">St. Joseph's</span> case is notable because it runs contrary to all Office of Federal Operations cases on the issue of noncompetitive reassignments as reasonable accommodations and because there is some potential for Supreme Court review. In the meantime, the Commission is highly unlikely to change its guidance on the topic.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission views reassignment to a vacant position as the last option in reasonable accommodation and one to be considered only after all other options have been deemed ineffective. The <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, "Types of Reasonable Accommodation Related to Job Performance, Reassignment," provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before considering reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, employers should first consider those accommodations that would enable an employee to remain in his/her current position. Reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and is required only after it has been determined that: (1) there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her current position, or (2) all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship. However, if both the employer and the employee voluntarily agree that transfer is preferable to remaining in the current position with some form of reasonable accommodation, then the employer may transfer the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Vacant" means that the position is available when the employee asks for reasonable accommodation, or that the employer knows that it will become available within a reasonable amount of time. A "reasonable amount of time" should be determined on a case-by-case basis considering relevant facts, such as whether the employer, based on experience, can anticipate that an appropriate position will become vacant within a short period of time. A position is considered vacant even if an employer has posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for that position. The employer does not have to bump an employee from a job in order to create a vacancy; nor does it have to create a new position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance</span> provides that, if reassignment cannot be made to a position that is comparable, the employer must consider reassignment to a lower level position. Although the guidance applies to the federal sector, an agency may not involuntarily reassign a career civil servant to a lower-graded position. Under 5 USC 7512, a reduction in pay or grade is an adverse action that triggers MSPB appeal rights for most federal employees. Reassigning an employee to a lower level position would constitute an adverse action, even if taken as part of "reasonable accommodation" efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent">"While the agency is not obligated to create a new position for [the] complainant, it must make a good faith effort to locate a vacant, funded position for which [the] complainant [is] qualified. Therefore, only after determining that reassignment to a vacant, funded position [is] not possible or would result in undue hardship, would the Rehabilitation Act permit the agency to conclude that [a complainant] is not a qualified individual with a disability." <span class="Italic">Boone v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23337 (2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Kitaura v. Postmaster General</span>, 03980089 (1999)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1373"></span>Moreover, reassignment is not restricted to nonprobationary employees, even though the Commission's former regulations at 29 CFR 1614.203(g) only provided for reassignment of nonprobationary employees. The regulations were inconsistent with the requirements of the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at p. 816, n.80. However, reassignment is a reasonable accommodation option for employees only and does not apply to applicants for employment. <span class="Italic">Hohensee v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A50043 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">By that same rationale, the organizational and geographic restrictions set forth in former 1614.203(g) also could not be applied to federal employees because they were inconsistent with the ADA. Although the Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance</span>, did not specifically exempt federal agencies from the requirements of 1614.203(g), it does provide that an employer cannot limit reassignment by organizational or geographic restrictions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">even if the employer has a policy prohibiting transfers from one office, branch, agency, department, facility, personnel system, or geographical area to another. The ADA contains no language limiting the obligation to reassign only to positions within an office, branch, agency, <span class="Italic">etc.</span> Rather, the extent to which an employer must search for a vacant position will be an issue of undue hardship. If an employee is being reassigned to a different geographical area, the employee must pay for any relocation expenses unless the employer routinely pays such expenses when granting voluntary transfers to other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A42573.txt">01A42573</a> (2004) (agency violated Rehabilitation Act by considering only reassignment within Redding, CA area). In considering reassignment under the ADA, the agency may not rely solely on the employee's SF-171, but should contact the employee to determine if he or she possesses skills or qualifications not reflected in the agency's records. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Schuetter v. Department of Defense</span>, 03970140 (1999), remanded the case to the agency, ordering the agency to take into account all of the complainant's skills in considering a reassignment as accommodation, as well as consulting with the complainant about such positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is reflected in the record that a Personnel Staffing Specialist (Staffing Specialist) was assigned to conduct a search for vacant positions to which petitioner could be reassigned. The Staffing Specialist testified at the hearing that she began the search by examining lists of vacant positions at the facility in which petitioner worked, and two nearby facilities. The Staffing Specialist related that she did not speak with petitioner concerning his qualifications, but relied solely upon his SF 171 and other related documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result of comparing only petitioner's qualifications listed on the SF 171 and the job descriptions from the list of vacancies, the Staffing Specialist identified one vacant position for which petitioner was minimally qualified, that of Transportation Clerk, GS-4. Upon further review, she stated that she determined that he was not qualified for the position because he did not possess the specific knowledge of government and commercial bills of lading, knowledge of different billing instructions, and knowledge of different formats of bills of lading and terminology. The Staffing Specialist admitted that she never contacted petitioner to discuss the position or his background relative to the requirements of the job. She stated instead that she treated his request for an accommodation no differently than she treated other applicants seeking various positions at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the hearing, petitioner testified that he had some experience while in the military as a master sergeant with the purchasing and stocking of supplies. He also offered that as a police officer for the agency he worked with the bills of lading and the warehouse operations of the facility. Finally, he asserted that to the extent he was not qualified for the Transportation Clerk position, the agency should have provided him with the training necessary, unless to do so would constitute an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that while petitioner's testimony does not definitively establish that he was qualified for the Transportation Clerk position, it casts doubt on the agency's determination that he was not qualified for this position. Although we agree with the agency that employers are not required, as an element of reasonable accommodation, to provide training in the essential functions of a vacant position, where the disabled individual lacks the knowledge, education, and/or skill requirements for the position, <span class="Italic">see</span> Appendix to Part 1630-Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA] (1996) (Guidance), Part 1630.2(m), an employer does have an obligation to provide the disabled individual with the same on-the-job instruction that it would provide any new employee. Thus, if the agency were to provide any new Transportation Clerks with basic instruction regarding different aspects of the job that would have enabled petitioner to perform its essential functions, the agency cannot deny the position to petitioner because he would be unable to perform the job without such instruction. In the present case, the Commission is unable to determine what type of training, if any, would be necessary for petitioner in this position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Acfalle v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A02198 (2003), the Commission held that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to consider reassignment because the employee had not requested reassignment as an accommodation. However, it is not clear that <span class="Italic">Acfalle</span> intended to set down a bright-line rule that, in all instances, the employee must specifically request reassignment as an accommodation in order to receive consideration. In <span class="Italic">Acfalle</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, an employee who is granted leave as a reasonable accommodation, is normally entitled to return to the same position unless the employer demonstrates that holding open the position would impose an undue hardship. Guidance at 27. We consider whether the agency has shown that complainant's absence on LWOP created an undue hardship on the agency. The agency argues that termination was necessary because of disruption of operations concerning the Forklift Operator position. Certainly, the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility is a relevant factor in a determination of undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(p)(2)(v); Guidance at 54.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the agency indicated in the March 29, 1994 letter of termination that "the Garden Shop need[ed] a regular full complement of associates to accomplish its work." The agency thus argued that it made the decision to terminate complainant's employment because to continue to grant leave created an undue hardship. The agency pointed out that the Forklift Operator position was one-of-a kind and was vital to its business operation. According to the agency, during complainant's absence the workload increased and the agency was forced to pull employees from other areas and have them work overtime in order to accomplish complainant's work. The agency asserted that it could not continue to operate in that manner and that it was essential that complainant's position be filled on a full-time basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once complainant received a notice that continued leave created an undue hardship, it was incumbent on him to request an alternative form of accommodation. Complainant argued that the agency never considered reassigning him in violation of the law. Significantly, the ADA specifically lists "reassignment to a vacant position" as a form of reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 37; 42 U.S.C. 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). This type of reasonable accommodation must be provided to an employee who because of a disability, can no longer perform the essential functions of his/her current position, with or without reasonable accommodation, unless the employer can show that it would be undue hardship. Guidance at 37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence establishes that even after notifying complainant that continued leave created an undue hardship, complainant failed to respond in any way. The agency's managers stated that complainant never requested reassignment or it would have tried to accommodate him. According to the agency, complainant only communicated that he was unable to work and needed additional leave. Complainant suggested that he did not understand the agency's notices and that he was impaired by medication, but he failed to produce medical documentation or other evidence to substantiate his claim of incapacitation. Moreover, complainant maintained communication with the agency regarding his short term disability application and requests for payment for other benefits. Therefore, we are not persuaded that complainant did not understand the agency's notice of termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, complainant must show that reassignment was a reasonable accommodation in the sense that there were vacant positions available for which he was qualified and that would have accommodated his disability<span class="Italic">. See Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (August 1, 2002). Complainant argued that he had previously been assigned a light duty position as the store clerk after his first heart attack and that he could have been assigned to that position, but he did not establish that this position or any other position was available during the time he was on extended leave. Thus, the Commission concludes that complainant did not establish that the agency failed to accommodate his disability when he was terminated from his position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Woltjen v. Attorney General</span>, 0120050848 (2007), the Commission found that the agency reasonably accommodated the complainant by reassigning him where there were no other accommodations that would permit him to perform the essential functions of his existing position. The complainant, a factory manager at a federal correctional facility in Beaumont, Texas, could not perform any duties related to restraint of inmates. Although restraint of inmates was not within the regular duties of a plant manager, all employees at the facility were required to have that capacity. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Woltjen</span>, held that reassignment to Washington, D.C., was an effective accommodation, even though it was not the accommodation of choice for the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the record reveals that in an August 1, 2001 letter complainant's doctor stated complainant could work limited duty with a splint and provided a 10-lb. lifting restriction. Additionally, the doctor noted that he is "concerned about [complainant] restraining inmates, and I think that would be difficult for him to do in his current condition" and the doctor made that a restriction on complainant's return to work. Further, we note that on August 16, 2001, complainant underwent a Functional Capacity Evaluation. After completing the examination, <span id="Page_1374"></span>complainant's physical therapist concluded complainant would be able to return to work, "provided that there is a job which matches the surgeon's restrictions as written. If employee is in an environment in which he may have to defend himself or restrain an inmate, then he does not meet the criteria." The record is clear that the Factory Manager position requires that the "incumbent must be prepared and trained to use physical control in situations such as fights among inmates, assaults on staff, and riots or escape attempts." "An employer does not have to eliminate an essential function, i.e, a fundamental duty of the position, in order to accommodate an individual with a disability." EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002 at p.9, 29 (rev. October 17, 2002) (Enforcement Guidance). We note that complainant did not submit contradicting medical evidence surrounding his abilities to perform the essential functions of his position with or without accommodation prior to the agency's decision to transfer him to Washington, D.C. We find that at the time the agency ordered complainant's transfer, the record supported the agency's contention that complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of his Factory Manager position. Thus, we find that the agency, at the time it ordered complainant's transfer, properly determined that complainant was not a "qualified individual" under the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, there is no evidence that there were any positions in Beaumont that did not require at least some ability to restrain inmates or to maintain the security of the institution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an individual with a disability cannot be accommodated in their current position, an agency is then obligated to consider the availability of a reassignment as an accommodation. When provided as a reasonable accommodation, a reassignment must be to a vacant position equivalent in terms of pay, status, and other related factors, including benefits, if the employee is qualified for the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Enforcement Guidance. If there are no vacant equivalent positions, then an agency may consider reassigning the individual to a vacant lower level position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, it is evident, at the time the agency decided to reassign him, that complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of his position, namely the ability to restrain inmates. Accordingly, we find that the agency properly took the next step and began to search for vacant positions for complainant. Although complainant states he would have taken a demotion in order to remain in Beaumont, there is no evidence that there was a vacant position in the facility that did not require at least some ability to restrain inmates. As a result, the agency reassigned complainant to an Industrial Specialist position, at the same grade level as his Factory Manager position. Although complainant may have preferred to have been reassigned to an Industrial Specialist position somewhere other than Washington, D.C., the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Enforcement Guidance, Question 9. We note that in this case, the agency provided complainant with a reasonable accommodation, even though it may not have been the exact accommodation that complainant wanted.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complainant alleges that he should have been reassigned as a reasonable accommodation, the complainant must show it is likely there were vacant positions that he could have performed with or without reasonable accommodation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 03A10099 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question of whether petitioner is a qualified person with a disability turns on whether there was a vacant, funded position at the equivalent pay or level (or lower) as her Mail Handler job and to which she could have been reassigned absent undue hardship. In order to determine whether petitioner is a qualified individual, the fact finder must determine whether, with or without accommodation, petitioner could perform the essential functions of any position which she could have held as a result of job restructuring or reassignment. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(m); <span class="Italic">see</span> also 29 C.F.R. 1630.3 (exceptions to definition); <span class="Italic">see Hawkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03990006 (February 11, 1999); <span class="Italic">Van</span> <span class="Italic">Horn v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01960159 (October 23, 1998). The petitioner has an evidentiary burden in reassignment cases to establish that it is more likely than not, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> by a preponderance of the evidence, that there were vacancies during the relevant time period into which petitioner could have been reassigned. Petitioner can establish this by producing evidence of particular vacancies; however, this is not the only way of meeting petitioner's evidentiary burden. In the alternative, petitioner need only show that: (1) s/he was qualified to perform a job or jobs which existed at the agency, and (2) that there were trends or patterns of turnover in the relevant jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period<span class="Italic">. See Hampton v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (July 31, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of this evidentiary burden, a complainant cannot prevail simply by showing that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process by conducting no job search at all or an inadequate job search. The complainant must also show that, had a sufficient search been conducted, it is more likely than not that an appropriate vacant position was available. <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15285 (2003). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Echol v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120051101 (2008); <span class="Italic">Castle-Ebright v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A42465 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Isaacson v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A30257.txt">01A30257</a> (2004), the Commission elaborated on the evidentiary burden of the complainant to establish a failure to reassign as an accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Isaacson</span>, the Commission held that the complainant need not identify specific vacant positions but, in the alternative, could establish that "there were trends of patterns of turnover in the relevant jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period."</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the complainant's evidentiary burden, it is reversible error for an administrative judge to preclude a complainant from offering evidence that vacant reassignment positions were available. In <span class="Italic">Mosley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A41577 (2005), the Commission remanded the case to the judge stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission recognizes that it is complainant's burden to prove that suitable vacant funded positions were available, we note that during the hearing, in an attempt to prove that complainant was "qualified" under a reassignment theory, complainant's representative tried to introduce evidence that funded vacancies (the above referenced NIXIE clerk position and also a computer clerk position) were available, but the AJ would not allow him to do so. We find that the AJ erred in excluding this evidence, or attempt to further develop this evidence. Specifically, we find that if complainant prevailed in demonstrating that there were suitable vacancies during the relevant time period, that would have satisfied her need for a reasonable accommodation, complainant could be deemed "qualified," and come under the protection of the Rehabilitation Act. We find that the AJ's exclusion of this evidence effectively precluded complainant from demonstrating that she was "qualified" under a reassignment theory. Although we note the agency objected that it was too "hypothetical" as to whether complainant was qualified for work in a computer position and, if so, whether such work was available, we disagree. Complainant's representative identified a particular computer clerk position, and agency records could confirm whether it was a funded vacant position at the time at issue. Moreover, agency records could identify the essential functions of that position. Complainant could present evidence of her computer skills and ability to otherwise perform the essential functions of this position. Because complainant identifies a particular position, in a particular location, and complainant attests that she is qualified for this position, we find that this is not merely a hypothetical inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant demonstrates that the agency failed to reassign him as an accommodation when he shows that he applied for two vacant positions, made the best qualified list for both positions, but was not selected for either position. <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A34968.txt">01A34968</a> (2006). Note that the complainant, if entitled to reasonable accommodation, is not required to apply and compete for vacant positions.</p>
<p class="noindent">That point was again brought home by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bowers v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720070012 (2010). In that case, the complainant had a genetic condition and was born with four fingers on her left hand attached to the same ligament and fused together in a cone. Several surgeries left her with no knuckles, dexterity or grasp, a left hand half the size of her right hand, and virtually no lifting ability. Overuse of her right arm resulted in bursitis, tendonitis and neuritis in the right arm. The complainant worked as a personnel specialist assigned to background investigations. Her position required a substantial amount of typing. Ultimately, the complainant was not able to meet the quantity of completed investigations under her performance standards. Initially, the complainant requested accommodation in the form of lowered production standards and adaptive technology. She was given a one-handed keyboard. Although she expressed doubts about its utility, the agency gave her a 30-day period to learn to use the keyboard. The complainant also applied for a position as a Privacy Act specialist, a position that required less typing and for which she was qualified. Soon thereafter, she requested that she be reassigned to the position as a reasonable accommodation. The agency denied her request, gave the complainant a 30-day trial period and advised her that she could face being placed on performance improvement plan if she did not meet production standards that had been increased. The vacancy announcement was subsequently withdrawn and the position left unfilled until the previous incumbent returned after working for another agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bowers</span>, found that the agency had failed to accommodate the complainant by noncompetitively reassigning her while the position was vacant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reassignment cases like this, complainant has an evidentiary burden to establish that it is more likely than not (i.e., by a preponderance of the evidence) that there were vacancies during the relevant time period into which complainant could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (August 1, 2002). Here, complainant established that a vacancy existed for which she was qualified, and she requested reassignment into the position on several occasions. At the time the 30-day trial period for the one-handed keyboard ended, the Privacy Act Specialist position was still vacant. Instead of simply reassigning complainant to the position, the agency <span id="Page_1375"></span>essentially made her compete for the position, because it determined that the person most qualified for the position was the individual who had recently vacated the position. The position remained open for several months after complainant was denied the position. However, an employee seeking reassignment as an accommodation should be placed in the position, if qualified, without competition. Reasonable Accommodation Guidance, at p. 47-48. There was no argument raised or evidence presented that complainant was not qualified for the Privacy Act Specialist position. The agency therefore should have reassigned her to the vacant Privacy Act Specialist position when it became apparent that she could not be reasonably accommodated in her Personnel Security Specialist position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also upheld a finding by the administrative judge that the agency engaged in retaliation when the agency dropped all attempts at reassigning the complainant after learning she had contacted an EEO counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">EEOC v. United Airlines, Inc</span>., 693 F.3d 759 (7th Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> No. 12-707 (May 28, 2013), the Court found that reassignment under the ADA is mandatory provided that the accommodation was reasonable and not an undue hardship on the employer. In that case, United Airlines had a policy of allowing reassignment as an accommodation but the vacancies for reassignment were subject to competition. Applicants for reassignment were automatically granted an interview and were given priority consideration if they were equally qualified with another applicant. Overruling a previous decision in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Humiston-Keeling</span>, 227 F.3d 1024 (7th Cir. 2000), and relying upon the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391 (2002), see section on "<a href="0100-2023-24-078.html#sec15-59">Collective Bargaining Agreements"</a> below, the Court in <span class="Italic">United Airlines</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court noted that <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> is directly on point and has not been overruled by the Seventh Circuit. The district court is correct on both points. <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> involved a worker, Houser, who could no longer perform her conveyor job due to an injured arm. 227 F.3d at 1026. After taking a temporary greeter position, Houser applied for vacant clerical positions within the company but did not get any of these jobs. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The EEOC brought suit, arguing the "reassignment form of reasonable accommodation...require[s] that the disabled person be advanced over a more qualified nondisabled person, provided only that the disabled person is at least minimally qualified to do the job, unless the employer can show undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1027 (internal quotation marks omitted). This court rejected that assertion, holding the "ADA does not require an employer to reassign a disabled employee to a job for which there is a better applicant, provided it's the employer's consistent and honest policy to hire the best applicant for the particular job in question." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1029.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC invites this court to overturn <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span>, arguing that <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> undercuts the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span>. In <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the Supreme Court considered reassignment under the ADA in the context of a seniority system. 535 U.S. at 393-95. Robert Barnett injured his back while working as a cargo-handler for U.S. Airways. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 394. He invoked seniority, not his disability status, and transferred to a mailroom position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Later, at least two employees senior to Barnett intended to bid for the mailroom position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Barnett argued he should be allowed to keep this position and claimed his reassignment was a reasonable accommodation mandated by the ADA because he was an individual with a disability capable of performing the essential functions of the mailroom job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 394-95.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court first noted that "[t]he simple fact that an accommodation would provide a 'preference'--in the sense that it would permit the worker with a disability to violate a rule that others must obey--cannot, in and of itself, automatically show that the accommodation is not 'reasonable.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 398 (emphasis in original). Instead, the Court outlined a two-step, case-specific approach. The "plaintiff/employee...need only show that an 'accommodation' seems reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 401. Once the plaintiff has shown he seeks a reasonable method of accommodation, the burden shifts to the defendant/employer to "show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 402. While <span class="Italic">Barnett's</span> special circumstances warrant a finding that the accommodation is reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The analysis of <span class="Italic">Barnett's</span> impact on <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> is further complicated by the fact that we are not the first panel to consider this issue. This court considered <span class="Italic">Barnett's</span> relationship to <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span>, albeit in an abbreviated fashion and without the benefit of briefing, in <span class="Italic">Mays v. Principi</span>, 301 F.3d 866 (7th Cir. 2002). In <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, this court relied on <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> in finding that an employer did not violate the duty of reasonable accommodation in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., by giving an administrative nursing position to a better qualified applicant, rather than to a disabled employee needing reassignment. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 301 F.3d at 871-72. The <span class="Italic">Mays</span> Court interpreted the recently handed down <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> decision actually to bolster <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> by equating seniority systems with any other normal method of filling vacancies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 872.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC argues, and we agree, that the <span class="Italic">Mays</span> Court incorrectly asserted that a best-qualified selection policy is essentially the same as a seniority system. In equating the two, the <span class="Italic">Mays</span> Court so enlarged the narrow, fact-specific exception set out in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> as to swallow the rule. While employers may prefer to hire the best qualified applicant, the violation of a best-qualified selection policy does not involve the property-rights and administrative concerns (and resulting burdens) presented by the violation of a seniority policy. To strengthen this critique, the EEOC points out the relative rarity of seniority systems and the distinct challenges of mandating reassignment in a system where employees are already entitled to particular positions based on years of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has found that accommodation through appointment to a vacant position is reasonable. Absent a showing of undue hardship, an employer must implement such a reassignment policy. The <span class="Italic">Mays</span> Court understandably erred in suggesting that deviation from a best-qualified selection policy always represented such a hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, the <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> framework does not contain categorical exceptions. On remand, the district court must conduct the <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> analysis. In this case, the district court must first consider (under <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> step one) if mandatory reassignment is ordinarily, in the run of cases, a reasonable accommodation. Assuming that the district court finds that mandatory reassignment is ordinarily reasonable, the district must then determine (under <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> step two) if there are fact-specific considerations particular to United's employment system that would create an undue hardship and render mandatory reassignment unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For its part, United argues that this court should not abandon <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span>, in part because the Eighth Circuit explicitly adopted the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> in <span class="Italic">Huber v. Wal-Mart</span>, 486 F.3d 480, 483-84 (8th Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">reh'g en banc denied</span>, 493 F.3d 1002 (8th Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">cert. granted in part</span>, 552 U.S. 1074 (2007), cert. dismissed, 552 U.S. 1136 (2008). The Eighth Circuit's wholesale adoption of Humiston-Keeling has little import. The opinion adopts <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> without analysis, much less an analysis of <span class="Italic">Humiston-Keeling</span> in the context of <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>. Two of our sister Circuits have already determined that the ADA requires employers to appoint disabled employees to vacant positions, provided that such accommodations would not create an undue hardship (or run afoul of a collective bargaining agreement): the Tenth in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc</span>., 180 F.3d 1154 (10th Cir. 1999) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) and the D.C. in <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center</span>, 156 F.3d 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). We feel that in light of <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, pursuant to Circuit Rule 40(e) as suggested under the procedure described above, we must adopt a similar approach.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120111876 (2013), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant by reassigning her to a position at one of three requested facilities. The agency did accommodate the complainant's lifting, standing and sitting restrictions but the position to which it reassigned her was outside of her five-mile driving restriction. However, the Commission found no failure to accommodate where all the requested facilities were also outside the five-mile restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent">When there are no vacant funded positions at the same grade and level that the complainant can perform with or without accommodation, the agency is required to consider reassignment to vacant funded lower level positions. In <span class="Italic">Bartron v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720100054 (2011), the complainant was a GS-13 auditor who was treated for cancer. The treatment resulted in the complainant sustaining nerve damage that affected her entire body. As a result, the complainant was unable to work on complex assignments under deadline, both of which were essential functions of her position. The Commission agreed with the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Bartron</span> that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant by considering reassignment to lower graded auditor positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ then analyzed whether the Agency had met its burden to provide reasonable accommodation, absent under hardship. The AJ found that with respect to the March 19, 2007 request for three days per week of telework, simplified duties, and no time constraints on her work, Complainant was basically asking the Agency to eliminate essential functions of her GS-13 Auditor position. The AJ found the record replete with evidence that the GS-13 Auditor position inherently involved complex tasks. Pursuant to the official position description, the work of a GS-13 Auditor consisted of, <span class="Italic">inter</span> <span class="Italic"> alia</span>, "performing varied duties that require resolving particularly difficult and complex problems in highly-responsible circumstances. Work at this level involves such functions as problem definition, intensive planning, coordination of many activities, and comprehensive analysis of a variety of functions and operations." Meeting deadlines was essential for a GS-13 Auditor. Complainant herself testified that many of the deadlines for the high profile audits on which she worked were set by Congress. The AJ concluded that reasonable accommodations do not include eliminating an essential function of a position or lowering production standards, and the Agency was therefore not liable for denying Complainant's March 2007 request for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1376"></span>However, the AJ continued:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The inquiry into whether the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate Complainant does not end here. As noted, reassignment as a potential form of accommodation becomes relevant after a determination is made that an individual cannot be accommodated in her current position. <span class="Italic">See Essenfeld v. National Security Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961377 (December 12, 1997); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 Appendix (Interpretative Guidance on Title I of the ADA), &#x00A7; 1630.2(o). In this regard, on May 22, 2007, approximately one month after S1's April 13, 2007 denial of Complainant's March 19, 2007 accommodation request, Complainant, through her attorney, requested accommodation again; this time, in the form of reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">S1 testified that upon receiving the May 22, 2007 request from Complainant's attorney, she inquired of HCAS whether it was necessary to consider reassignment for Complainant or to respond in some manner to the May 22, 2007 request. S1 testified that she was told by HCAS that it was not necessary to consider reassignment or to respond to the May 22, 2007 request. S1 further testified that she was told by personnel that the Agency "doesn't look at reassignment options during accommodation."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The record contains testimony from the HR Specialist that is consistent with S1's testimony that, generally, the Agency does not consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, and specifically, it did not do so in this case. In this regard, the HR Specialist testified that she recalled receiving the May 22, 2007 request for accommodation, and while she is typically involved in reasonable accommodation discussions, she did not look into reassignment after receiving that request. The HR Specialist further testified that she was not aware that any Agency official looked into reassignment in response to the May 22, 2007 request.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The HR Specialist testified that the Agency did explore reassigning Complainant prior to receiving the May 22, 2007 request, in conjunction with her disability retirement application. Specifically, the HR Specialist explained that as part of the disability retirement process, the Agency reviews vacancies to see if reassignment is an option. Complainant's disability retirement form indicates that reassignment was not an option in her case because there were "no vacant positions at [the Agency], at the same grade or pay level and tenure within the same commuting area, for which [Complainant met] the minimum qualification standards."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to Commission Guidance, when provided as a reasonable accommodation, a reassignment must be to a vacant position equivalent in terms of pay, status, and other related factors, including benefits, if the employee is qualified for the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (October 17, 2002). Importantly, however, if there are no vacant equivalent positions, then an Agency must consider reassigning the individual to a vacant lower level position.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> This standard differs significantly from that which the Agency applied in exploring reassignment options for Complainant in conjunction with her disability retirement application. As noted on Complainant's disability retirement form, reassignment was listed as not being an option because there were "no vacant positions at [the Agency], at the same grade or pay level and tenure within the same commuting area, for which [Complainant met] the minimum qualification standards." However, the Agency's reassignment search in conjunction with Complainant's disability retirement application, which uncovered no positions at Complainant's grade level, did not address whether there were any vacant lower level positions into which Complainant could have been reassigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Agency's failure to conduct either any search at all, or a broad enough search, for a new position for a Complainant does not, by itself, result in a finding of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Rather, the record must be examined for evidence that had the search been conducted, there would have been an appropriate vacancy available. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A40871 (June 29, 2006). In <span class="Italic">Hampton v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (July 31, 2002), the Commission clarified its position regarding the standard for assessing liability for reassignment. Specifically, the Commission determined that, with respect to reassignment, the burden is on a Complainant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there were vacancies during the relevant time period into which she could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A Complainant can establish this by producing evidence of particular vacancies, or, in the alternative, a Complainant can show that: (1) she was qualified to perform a job or jobs which existed at the Agency, and (2) there were trends or patterns of turnover in the relevant jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period. <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A02374 (Dec. 4, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant has not produced evidence of any particular vacancies that existed during the relevant time period. However, Complainant has shown, through her own testimony as well as that of S1, that she was qualified to perform a GS-9 auditor position during the relevant time period. Additionally, through her own testimony as well as that of S1, Complainant has demonstrated that a GS-9 auditor position was likely vacant during the relevant time period. Specifically, Complainant testified that from March through June 2007, she believes that there were vacant funded jobs posted on USA Jobs in the audit area into which she could have been reassigned. Consistent with this testimony, S1 testified that in May 2007, she believes it possible that there was an auditor position at DoD in which Complainant could have worked from among the 6000 auditor positions at DoD.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant must identify actual positions at the agency and not merely identify job task that he can perform. <span class="Italic">Bates v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090592 (2011) ("Complainant [has] to satisfy the burden of identifying a vacant funded position, he has to go beyond mere task-cobbing.").</p>
<p class="noindent">As part of establishing that she is qualified, a complainant must make a showing that she was able to perform the essential functions of her present job. An employee who assumes a job and within a short period of time requests reassignment is not a qualified individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Senatore v. Attorney General</span>, 0120123554 (2013);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers cannot deny a reassignment to an employee solely because she is designated as "probationary." However, if, as here, the probationary employee has never adequately performed the essential functions of her original position then she is not entitled to reassignment. In this situation, the employee is similar to an applicant who applies for a job for which she is not qualified, and then requests reassignment. Applicants are not entitled to reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Charlie O. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142688 (2016), the complainant requested a reassignment to another position at the same grade level at a facility that was closer to his home as a reasonable accommodation for his sleep apnea. The agency conducted an "engaged, interactive process," but found no position that met the complainant's qualifications, grade level and medical restrictions. The Commission upheld the administrative judge's finding of no discrimination. Here is where things got interesting. The Commission further upheld the administrative judge's finding that "the accommodation requested by Complainant was not to enable him to perform any functions or his or another position, but rather related more to his need to reduce the length of his commute to work." The point the Commission made here is that reassignment to a different facility for a shorter commute time has to help enable the complainant to perform his or her job functions. Even with a shorter commute time, in <span class="Italic">Charlie O</span>., the complainant failed to show that he could otherwise perform the duties of his position once he arrived at work.</p>
