<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-52"><span class="space">C.</span> AGE AS DETERMINATIVE FACTOR</h3>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.</span>, 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), the Commission long held the position that an employee need not show that age was the sole or exclusive cause of the employer's actions. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Lasley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01870615 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that age need not be the sole or exclusive cause of the employer's action. Rather, if age is found to be a determining factor in the retention or removal of the employee, even in the presence of other, perhaps more compelling factors, then removal or, in this case, forced retirement, constitutes age discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission had also acknowledged that the burden of proof in ADEA is somewhat higher than in Title VII cases where the complainant need only show that a prohibited basis was a motivating factor. Under <span class="Italic">Harris v. National Capitol Planning Commission</span>, 01860613 (1988), age is considered to be a determinative factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"if in fact it made a difference in deciding whether [the complainant] was to be retained or discharged. This is so even though the need to reduce the employee force generally was also a strong, and perhaps even more compelling reason." <span class="Italic">Laugesen v. The Anaconda Co.</span>, 510 F.2d 307, 317 (6th Cir. 1975). That is, "[i]f age is what tips the scale in an adverse employment decision, a violation of the [Age Discrimination in Employment] Act has occurred." [<span class="Italic">Cuddy v. Carmen</span>, 694 F.2d 853, 858, n.23. (D.C. Cir. 1982)].</p>
<p class="noindent">In the alternative, the Commission explained age as a determinative factor in terms of the classic "but for" test. <span class="Italic">In re Veterans Administration</span>, 01880166 (1988), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant bears the burden of persuasion in showing that age was a determinative factor in the agency's selection of appellant for detail. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Bailar</span>, 629 F.2d 892, 897 (3rd Cir. 1980). Appellant must show that age was a "but for" factor in the decision to detail him. While evidence of a desire or effort to retire appellant may be probative of a discriminatory animus based on age, such evidence is not necessarily dispositive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. General Foods Corporation</span>, 46 FEP Cases 534, 539 (11th Cir. 1988) (retirement offer not necessarily probative of discriminatory intent); <span class="Italic">Lasley v. Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01870616 (October 8, 1987), Request No. 05880113 (February 26, 1988) (request to reopen and reconsider granted, finding no age discrimination in agency's offer to allow employee to retire).</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where the agency offers several reasons for its action, any of which standing alone would justify its action, demonstration that one of the reasons is pretextual does not necessarily prove that all reasons are pretextual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie, Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. 18-882 (Supreme Court April 6, 2020), confirmed that whether age was the "but for cause" of a personnel decision will inform the type of relief available to the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain meaning of the critical statutory language ("made free from any discrimination based on age") demands that personnel actions be untainted by any consideration of age. This does not mean that a plaintiff may obtain all forms of relief that are generally available for a violation of &#x00A7; 633a(a), including hiring, reinstatement, backpay, and compensatory damages, without showing that a personnel action would have been different if age had not been taken into account. To obtain such relief, a plaintiff must show that age was a but-for cause of the challenged employment decision. But if age discrimination played a lesser part in the decision, other remedies may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Babb can establish that the VA violated &#x00A7; 633a(a) without proving that age was a but-for cause of the VA's personnel actions, she acknowledges--and we agree--that but-for causation is important in determining the appropriate remedy. It is bedrock law that "requested relief" must "redress the alleged injury." <span class="Italic">Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment</span>, 523 U.S. 83, 103 (1998). Thus, &#x00A7; 633a(a) plaintiffs who demonstrate only that they were subjected to unequal consideration cannot obtain reinstatement, backpay, compensatory damages, or other forms of relief related to the end result of an employment decision. To obtain such remedies, these plaintiffs must show that age discrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have long employed these basic principles. In <span class="Italic">Texas v. Lesage</span>, 528 U.S. 18, 21-22 (1999) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), we applied this rule to a plaintiff who sought recovery under Rev. Stat. &#x00A7; 1979, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1983, for an alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause. We explained: "[W]here a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting [damages] relief." 528 U.S., at 21. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 285 (1977) (rejecting rule that "would require reinstatement...even if the same decision would have been reached had the incident not occurred").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion is also supported by traditional principles of tort and remedies law. "Remedies generally seek to place the victim of a legal wrong...in the position that person would have occupied if the wrong had not occurred." R. Weaver, E. Shoben, &#x0026; M. Kelly, <span class="small">PRINCIPLES OF REMEDIES</span> (3d ed. 2017). Thus, "[a]n actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious." Restatement (Third) of Torts &#x00A7; 29, p. 493 (2005). Remedies should not put a plaintiff in a more favorable position than he or she would have enjoyed absent discrimination. But this is precisely what would happen if individuals who cannot show that discrimination was a but for cause of the end result of a personnel action could receive relief that alters or compensates for the end result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although unable to obtain such relief, plaintiffs are not without a remedy if they show that age was a but-for cause of differential treatment in an employment decision but not a but-for cause of the decision itself. In that situation, plaintiffs can seek injunctive or other forward-looking relief. Determining what relief, if any, is appropriate in the present case is a matter for the District Court to decide in the first instance if Babb succeeds in showing that &#x00A7; 633a(a) was violated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem with the "age as a determinative factor" standard was that despite attempts to clarify the standard, it remained unclear as to the precise role that age has to play in an employment decision in order for a plaintiff to prevail on an ADEA complaint. The Commission's formulation that age has to be shown to be a "determinative factor" while other factors even "more compelling" can be present did little to precisely define the quantum of proof required in an ADEA case. To complicate matters even more, many age discrimination claims invoke factors that may have some correlation to age. A classic example is between age and pension-vesting rights. An employer can terminate an employee in order to avoid vesting of those rights. Because pension vesting in the private sector is generally a function of time served with the employer, there can be a <span id="Page_1464"></span>correlation between pension vesting and age. The "determinative factor" test is not particularly helpful in such situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the pension-vesting example has no real application to federal sector employees, there are other situations where age and factors that may be related to age become intertwined. For example, in some fields, an agency may place more weight on the recency of an educational degree. There is no direct correlation between age and the recency of an educational degree but, as a practical matter, most recent graduates would tend to be younger persons.</p>
<p class="noindent">The resolution of the precise meaning of the "determinative factor" test became even more important in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). (For a complete discussion of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, see Chapter 10, on "<a href="0100-2023-19-056.html#sec10-49">Pretext--Circumstantial Evidence Cases</a>.") In <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the Supreme Court held that a showing of pretext, standing alone, did not require a finding of discrimination. Because the ultimate question in a discrimination case is the employer's motivation, showing that the proffered reason for an action is pretext does not, in all cases, resolve the issue of the employer's actual motivation. Indeed, the district court in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> expressly found that the employer's reason for discipline was pretextual, but also found that the employee had not demonstrated the employer's motivation was racial as opposed to purely personal.</p>
<p class="noindent">After granting <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> but prior to issuing a decision in the case, the Supreme Court took up the meaning of the "determinative factor" test in an ADEA case in <span class="Italic">Hazen Paper Company v. Biggins</span>, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Hazen</span>, a 62-year-old employee alleged that he was terminated on the basis of age when the employer removed him just weeks prior to the vesting of his pension. The Supreme Court held that the employee had not demonstrated discrimination based on age. The Court found that the ADEA was expressly passed to combat the notion that productivity and competence declined with age. In order for an ADEA plaintiff to show that a factor other than age is essentially a surrogate for age, he or she must show a relationship between that factor and stereotyped perceptions about the productivity and competence of older workers. When an employer acts with the motive of depriving an employee of his pension rights, the motivation is purely economic and is not related to productivity and competence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In deciding the <span class="Italic">Hazen</span> case, the Supreme Court noted that it never ruled on whether the adverse impact theory is available in ADEA cases and analyzed the facts only under the disparate treatment theory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the pension problem does not arise in federal sector employment, the <span class="Italic">Hazen</span> decision, 113 S. Ct. at 1705-08, is significant because of the way in which it clarifies the "determinative factor" standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts of appeals repeatedly have faced the question whether an employer violates the ADEA by acting on the basis of a factor, such as an employee's pension status or seniority, that is empirically correlated with age. Compare <span class="Italic">White v. Westinghouse Electric Co.</span>, 862 F.2d 56, 62 (CA3 1988) (firing of older employee to prevent vesting of pension benefits violates ADEA); <span class="Italic">Metz v. Transit Mix, Inc.</span>, 828 F.2d 1202 (CA7 1987) (firing of older employee to save salary costs resulting from seniority violates ADEA) with <span class="Italic">Williams v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 656 F.2d 120, 130, n.17 (CA5 1981) ("[S]eniority and age discrimination are unrelated.... We state without equivocation that the seniority a given plaintiff has accumulated entitles him to no better or worse treatment in an age discrimination suit."), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1439, 71 L. Ed.2d 655 (1982); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Clay Printing Co.</span>, 955 F.2d 936, 942 (CA4 1992) (emphasizing distinction between employee's age and years of service). We now clarify that there is no disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employee's age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We long have distinguished between "disparate treatment" and "disparate impact" theories of employment discrimination. "'Disparate treatment'...is the most easily understood type of discrimination. The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion [or other protected characteristics.] Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences in treatment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[C]laims that stress 'disparate impact' [by contrast] involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. Proof of discriminatory motive...is not required under a disparate-impact theory." <span class="Italic">Teamsters v. United</span><span class="Italic"> </span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 335, n.15, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1855, n.15, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977) (citation omitted) (construing Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964). The disparate treatment theory is of course available under the ADEA, as the language of that statute makes clear. "It shall be unlawful for an employer...to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 USC &#x00A7; 623(a)(1) (emphasis added)<span class="Italic">. See Thurston, supra</span>, 469 U.S., at 120-125, 105 S. Ct., at 621-624 (affirming ADEA liability under disparate treatment theory). By contrast, we have never decided whether a disparate impact theory of liability is available under the ADEA, <span class="Italic">see Markham v. Geller</span>, 451 U.S. 945, 101 S. Ct. 2028, 68 L. Ed.2d 332 (1981) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting from denial of <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>), and we need not do so here. Respondent claims only that he received disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer's decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 75 L. Ed.2d 403 (1983); <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 252-256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093-1095, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981); <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576-578, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 2949-2950, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978). The employer may have relied upon a formal, facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment of employees with that trait. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Thurston, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dept. of Water &#x0026; Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 704-718, 98 S. Ct. 1370, 1373-1380, 55 L. Ed.2d 657 (1978). Or the employer may have been motivated by the protected trait on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span>, informal basis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Anderson v. Bessemer City</span>, 470 U.S. 564, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed.2d 518 (1985); <span class="Italic">Teamsters, supra</span>, 431 U.S., at 334-343, 97 S. Ct., at 1854-1859. Whatever the employer's decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in that process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disparate treatment, thus defined, captures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA. It is the very essence of age discrimination for an older employee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and competence decline with old age. As we explained in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Wyoming</span>, 460 U.S. 226, 103 S. Ct. 1054, 75 L. Ed.2d 18 (1983), Congress' promulgation of the ADEA was prompted by its concern that older workers were being deprived of employment on the basis of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Although age discrimination rarely was based on the sort of animus motivating some other forms of discrimination, it was based in large part on stereotypes unsupported by objective fact.... Moreover, the available empirical evidence demonstrated that arbitrary age lines were in fact generally unfounded and that, as an overall matter, the performance of older workers was at least as good as that of younger workers." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 231, 103 S. Ct., at 1057-1058.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus the ADEA commands that "employers are to evaluate [older] employees...on their merits and not their age." <span class="Italic">Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell</span>, 472 U.S. 400, 422, 105 S. Ct. 2743, 2756, 86 L. Ed.2d 321 (1985). The employer cannot rely on age as a proxy for an employee's remaining characteristics, such as productivity, but must instead focus on those factors directly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the employer's decision is wholly motivated by factors other than age, the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes disappears. This is true even if the motivating factor is correlated with age, as pension status typically is. Pension plans typically provide that an employee's accrued benefits will become nonforfeitable, or "vested," once the employee completes a certain number of years of service with the employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 J. Mamorsky, <span class="Italic">Employee Benefits Law</span> &#x00A7; 5.03 (1992). On average, an older employee has had more years in the work force than a younger employee, and thus may well have accumulated more years of service with a particular employer. Yet an employee's age is analytically distinct from his years of service. An employee who is younger than 40, and therefore outside the class of older workers as defined by the ADEA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 631(a), may have worked for a particular employer his entire career, while an older worker may have been newly hired. Because age and years of service are analytically distinct, an employer can take account of one while ignoring the other, and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily "age--based."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant case is illustrative. Under the Hazen Paper pension plan, as construed by the Court of Appeals, an employee's pension benefits vest after the employee completes 10 years of service with the company. Perhaps it is true that older employees of Hazen Paper are more likely to be "close to vesting" than younger employees. Yet a decision by the company to fire an older employee solely because he has nine-plus years of service and therefore is "close to vesting" would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age. The prohibited stereotype ("Older employees are likely to be ___") would not have figured in this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue. The decision would not be the result of an inaccurate and denigrating generalization about age, but would rather represent an accurate judgment about the employee--that he indeed is "close to vesting."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not mean to suggest that an employer lawfully could fire an employee in order to prevent his pension benefits from vesting. Such conduct is actionable under &#x00A7; 510 of ERISA, as the Court of Appeals rightly found in affirming judgment for respondent under that statute. <span class="Italic">See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon</span>, 498 U.S. 133, 142-143, 111 S. Ct. 478, 484-485, 112 L. Ed.2d 474 (1990). But it would not, without more, violate the ADEA. That law requires the employer to ignore an employee's age (absent a statutory exemption or defense); it does not specify further <span id="Page_1465"></span>characteristics that an employer must also ignore. Although some language in our prior decisions might be read to mean that an employer violates the ADEA whenever its reason for firing an employee is improper in any respect, <span class="Italic">see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973) (creating proof framework applicable to ADEA) (employer must have "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for action against employee), this reading is obviously incorrect. For example, it cannot be true that an employer who fires an older black worker because the worker is black thereby violates the ADEA. The employee's race is an improper reason, but it is improper under Title VII, not the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not preclude the possibility that an employer who targets employees with a particular pension status on the assumption that these employees are likely to be older thereby engages in age discrimination. Pension status may be a proxy for age, not in the sense that the ADEA makes the two factors equivalent, <span class="Italic">cf. Metz</span>, 828 F.2d, at 1208 (using "proxy" to mean statutory equivalence), but in the sense that the employer may suppose a correlation between the two factors and act accordingly. Nor do we rule out the possibility of dual liability under ERISA and the ADEA where the decision to fire the employee was motivated both by the employee's age and by his pension status. Finally, we do not consider the special case where an employee is about to vest in pension benefits as a result of his age, rather than years of service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 1 Mamorsky, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at &#x00A7; 5.02[2], and the employer fires the employee in order to prevent vesting. That case is not presented here. Our holding is simply that an employer does not violate the ADEA just by interfering with an older employee's pension benefits that would have vested by virtue of the employee's years of service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Besides the evidence of pension interference, the Court of Appeals cited some additional evidentiary support for ADEA liability. Although there was no direct evidence of petitioners' motivation, except for two isolated comments by the Hazens, the Court of Appeals did note the following indirect evidence: Respondent was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, even though no other employee had been required to do so, and his replacement was a younger man who was given a less onerous agreement. 953 F.2d, at 1411. In the ordinary ADEA case, indirect evidence of this kind may well suffice to support liability if the plaintiff also shows that the employer's explanation for its decision--here, that respondent had been disloyal to Hazen Paper by doing business with its competitors--is "'unworthy of credence.'" <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, 460 U.S., at 716, 103 S. Ct., at 1482 (quoting <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 256, 101 S. Ct., at 1095). But inferring age-motivation from the implausibility of the employer's explanation may be problematic in cases where other unsavory motives, such as pension interference, were present. This issue is now before us in the Title VII context, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks v. St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, 970 F.2d 487 (CA8 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, 506 U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 954, 122 L. Ed.2d 111 (1993), and we will not address it prematurely. We therefore remand the case for the Court of Appeals to reconsider whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find an ADEA violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the Supreme Court subsequently issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, holding that a finding of pretext is not the equivalent of a finding of discrimination. It seems clear, though, that <span class="Italic">Hazen</span> prohibits any assumption that a mere correlation between age and other factors is evidence of discriminatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Hazen</span>, the Commission has held that in demonstrating that age was a determinative factor, in addition to evidence of pretext it will also consider the testimony of other witnesses who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of age. In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01930356 (1994), the Commission found that such evidence, combined with the showing of pretext, was sufficient to require a finding of discrimination. After analyzing the respective qualifications of the selectee and the complainant and finding the complainant's qualifications to be superior and also finding the selecting official's explanation of the selection to be pretextual, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Commission notes the testimony of three former supervisors, all well over the age of 40, that they either transferred or retired from the Audit Branch because they were constantly harassed by the SO to the point where it was impossible to continue working with him. The Commission determines that such harassment was evidence of definite age bias on the part of the SO, given the latter's predilection for and patronage of younger men such as the selectee (age 32), with whom he had an amicable relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did not specifically cite <span class="Italic">Hazen</span> and it is not clear if it would have found age discrimination without the evidence of motive. <span class="Italic">Hazen</span>, in combination with <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, would appear to prevent such a result.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span>, 120 S. Ct. 444 (1999), to take up the issue of the proper degree of proof in age discrimination cases. In <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span>, 197 F.3d 688 (5th Cir. 1999), the court had held that there was insufficient proof of age discrimination where one of the managers who recommended the plaintiff's termination had made age-related comments to the employee but not in the context of his removal. In <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed.2d 105 (2000), the Court held that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, coupled with sufficient evidence to discredit the employer's proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, may be sufficient to sustain a finding of discrimination under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> was terminated, ostensibly for faulty recordkeeping on time and attendance of the employees he supervised. He presented evidence that in fact, his recordkeeping was not faulty, and that one of the managers responsible for the decision to terminate him had made age-related comments and had treated him less favorably than younger employees. The Fifth Circuit discredited Reeves' evidence on the recordkeeping, and emphasized that the age-related comments were not made in the context of Reeves' removal. The court also noted that the two other managers in the decisionmaking process were not motivated by age. The Court in <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 120 S. Ct. at 2108-09, found that the Fifth Circuit's reasoning that something more than a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and evidence of pretext is necessarily required to show that an employer is "motivated" by age indicated a misunderstanding of the burdens of proof:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so reasoning, the Court of Appeals misconceived the evidentiary burden borne by plaintiffs who attempt to prove intentional discrimination through indirect evidence. This much is evident from our decision in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>. There we held that the factfinder's rejection of the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action does not <span class="Italic">compel</span> judgment for the plaintiff. 509 U.S., at 511. The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated, and proof that "the employer's proffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff's proffered reason...is correct."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 524. In other words, "[i]t is not enough...to <span class="Italic">dis</span>believe the employer; the factfinder must <span class="Italic">believe</span> the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 519.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, however, we reasoned that it is <span class="Italic">permissible</span> for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer's explanation. Specifically, we stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will <span class="Italic">permit</span> the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 511.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, at 517 ("[P]roving the employer's reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination"). In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as "affirmative evidence of guilt." <span class="Italic">Wright v.</span> West, 505 U.S. 277, 296 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Wilson v. United States</span>, 162 U.S. 613, 620-621 (1896); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence &#x00A7; 278(2), p. 133 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1979). Moreover, once the employer's justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision<span class="Italic">. Cf. Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978) ("[W]hen all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer's actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts with <span class="Italic">some</span> reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration"). Thus, a plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will <span class="Italic">always</span> be adequate to sustain a jury's finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory. For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred<span class="Italic">. See Aka v. Washington Hospital Center</span>, 156 F. 3d, at 1291-1292;<span class="Italic"> see also</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Vassar College</span>, 114 F. 3d, at 1338 ("[I]f the circumstances show that the defendant gave the false explanation to conceal something other than discrimination, the inference of discrimination will be weak or nonexistent"). To hold otherwise would be effectively to insulate an entire category of employment discrimination cases from review under Rule 50, and we have reiterated that trial <span id="Page_1466"></span>courts should not "'treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.'" <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 524 (quoting <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, 460 U.S., at 716).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See infra</span>, at 15-16. For purposes of this case, we need not--and could not--resolve all of the circumstances in which such factors would entitle an employer to judgment as a matter of law. It suffices to say that, because a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and sufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation may permit a finding of liability, the Court of Appeals erred in proceeding from the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court unanimously held that in the <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> case, the employer was clearly not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court noted that, in addition to establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and evidence to discredit the agency's proffered legitimate reason, the plaintiff also introduced evidence that one of the decisionmakers was motivated by age-based animus and was "principally responsible" for his firing. The Court, 120 S. Ct. at 2110-11, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner testified that Chesnut had told him that he "was so old [he] must have come over on the Mayflower" and, on one occasion when petitioner was having difficulty starting a machine, that he "was too damn old to do [his] job." According to petitioner, Chesnut would regularly "cuss at me and shake his finger in my face." Oswalt, roughly 24 years younger than petitioner, corroborated that there was an "obvious difference" in how Chesnut treated them. He stated that, although he and Chesnut "had [their] differences," "it was nothing compared to the way [Chesnut] treated Roger." Oswalt explained that Chesnut "tolerated quite a bit" from him even though he "defied" Chesnut "quite often," but that Chesnut treated petitioner "[i]n a manner, as you would...treat...a child when...you're angry with [him]." Petitioner also demonstrated that, according to company records, he and Oswalt had nearly identical rates of productivity in 1993. Yet respondent conducted an efficiency study of only the regular line, supervised by petitioner, and placed only petitioner on probation. Chesnut conducted that efficiency study and, after having testified to the contrary on direct examination, acknowledged on cross-examination that he had recommended that petitioner be placed on probation following the study.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court in <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> decided to bypass sending the case back to the Court of Appeals, and determined that, given the evidence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, enough evidence was introduced for a jury to reject the employer's proffered reason and of age-based animus, and the case should be sent directly to a jury.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same 5-4 majority that prevailed in <span class="Italic">Ricci v. DeStefano, see</span> Chapter 10, joined together in <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.</span>, 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), to hold that a plaintiff in an Age Discrimination in Employment Act claim must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that age was the "but for" cause of the employment action and that the burden of proof does not shift to the employer to show it would have taken the same action regardless of age even where there is some evidence that age was a factor in the action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff, a 54-year-old claims administration director with FBL, was reassigned to a new position, claims administration manager, and a female in her early 40s was assigned to his former position. Although both Gross and his female counterpart, Lisa Kneeskern, received the same compensation, Gross contended that the reassignment was a demotion in terms of job responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">After trial, the district court judge instructed the jury that if Gross proved by a preponderance of the evidence that age was a motivating factor in the decision to demote him, it must return a verdict for him. The judge further instructed the jury that if FBL proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have demoted him regardless of his age, it must return a verdict for FBL. The jury found in favor of Gross.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed finding that the jury had been improperly instructed under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). The Court construed <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> to require the presentation of direct evidence of discrimination before the mixed-motive analysis applies. The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Thomas delivered the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Alito. The Court held that a mixed-motive analysis is never proper under the ADEA and that, in order to prevail on such a claim, the employee must demonstrate that age was the reason the employer decided to act.</p>
<p class="noindent">First, the majority rejected the notion that Title VII jurisprudence should be relied upon in interpreting the ADEA. Justice Thomas, in <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court has never held that this burden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline to do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we "must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination."<span class="Italic"> Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki,</span> 552 U.S. _____, _____ (2008). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA's text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VII to add &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m) and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, &#x00A7; 115, 105 Stat. 1079; <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00A7; 302, at 1088.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot ignore Congress' decision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</span> 499 U.S. 244, 256 (1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, "negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest" when the provisions were "considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted." <span class="Italic">Lindh v. Murphy,</span> 521 U.S. 320, 330 (1997). As a result, the Court's interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as <span class="Italic">Desert Palace</span> and <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The majority noted that 29 USC &#x00A7; 623(a)(1) makes it an unlawful employment practice to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensations, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <span class="Italic">because of</span> such individual's age." (Emphasis in original.) It then found that the ordinary dictionary meaning of that phrase was that age was a "but for" cause or, in other words, "that age was the 'reason' that the employer decided to act."</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, Justice Thomas writing for the majority in <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It follows, then, that under &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was the "but-for" cause of the employer's adverse action. Indeed, we have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner in ADEA cases. <span class="Italic">See Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC,</span> 554 U.S. _____, _____-_____, _____-_____ (2008); <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 141, 143 (2000). And nothing in the statute's text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the statutory text is "silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion," we "begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims." <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Weast,</span> 546 U.S. 49, 56 (2005); <span class="Italic">see also Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</span> 554 U.S. _____, _____ (2008) ("Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise,...we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief' (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule in this setting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct or circumstantial), that age was the "but-for" cause of the challenged employer decision. <span class="Italic">See Reeves, supra,</span> at 141-143, 147.</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority also rejected the contention that <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> applied arguing that "it is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first instance," and that the mixed-motive approach had proven difficult for judges to properly articulate to juries.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Stevens, writing a dissent joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer, accused the majority of adopting a "but for" standard that had previously been rejected by the Court, as well as Congress in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. He further criticized the majority for deciding a question not presented on <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">While the <span class="Italic">Gross</span> case has made it substantially more difficult for complainants to prove age discrimination, it still is not impossible. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mills v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720090051 (2010), the Commission upheld a finding of age discrimination by its administrative judge explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the record indicates that there is substantial evidence to support the finding that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination. We also find that the agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Specifically, complainant was not selected in favor of the selectee because the selectee would be less likely to challenge authority than complainant because he was new at the agency. The agency maintains however, that the AJ erred in finding that the selectee only had two years of experience as an electrician. The agency asserts that the evidence shows that the selectee served in the Navy as an electrician for over 20 years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the selectee's testimony indicates that while he served in the navy, electrical work was only one of several duties that he performed and only 50% of the time. He states: "Probably about 50 percent of the time I worked in facilities, maintenance position, work as a duty electrician, as a shop supervisor, in those capacities also." Hearing Transcript, at 68-9. In addition, it is undisputed that the selectee was only an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs for 2 years, compared to complainant's 25 years or more. In addition, the AJ's finding that complainant established <span id="Page_1467"></span>pretext was based on numerous other factors, not just the alleged difference in the years of work experience of the two candidates. For one thing, the AJ was persuaded by complainant's overall "credible" testimony, as compared with management's conflicting testimony about whether complainant was told that "longevity" was a reason for his non-selection and then told that he could not go into it because of "EEO ramifications."</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the AJ found the nonselection of complainant to be particularly perplexing given that around the time of the interview process, complainant had just been honored by his superiors as the federal employee of the year in a citation that noted that he was responsible for saving the agency approximately $95,000.00 as result of a recent recommendation which he made and implemented. The AJ also found that the selectee had received no awards of any kind in his very short period of employment with the agency. The Commission finds that there is substantial evidence in record to support the AJ's determination that but for complainant's age, he would have been selected for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The dissent would have applied the same definition of "because of" that is used in Title VII cases; namely, that a plaintiff can prevail by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that age was a motivating factor in the employer's decision. The employer would then be entitled, under the mixed motive analysis, to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even absent consideration of age. The dissent's overall view is summarized in Justice Stevens' observation that "the majority's inattention to prudential Court practices is matched by its utter disregard for our precedent and Congress' intent."</p>
<p class="noindent">On February 18, 2010, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on "<a href="0100-2023-25-045.html#sec16-44">Factors other than Age</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequently, the Commission has rejected the application of <span class="Italic">Gross</span> in federal sector cases. In <span class="Italic">Goblirsch-Erickson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110390 (2011), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the holding in <span class="Italic">Gross, Fuller v. Gates, Secretary of Defense</span> concluded that <span class="Italic">Gross</span> applied to private employment, and not employment by the federal government. <span class="Italic">See Fuller v. Gates, Secretary of Defense,</span> 2010 WL 774965 (E.D. Tx. March 1, 2010). The court in<span class="Italic"> Fuller</span> found that the different language in the two sections of the ADEA demonstrated that Congress intended different meanings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, the <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> court determined that based on its plain meaning, "free from any" must be construed as being broader than "because of," such that the "mixed motive analysis" continues to apply in age discrimination claims against the federal government. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that Complainant has not shown that age played any part in the reason for her non-selection. The selectee was younger than Complainant by only 5 years, and the selecting official was noted to be older than Complainant (exact age not specified in record).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Alotta v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120093865 (2011) (noting <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> court holding that mixed motive analysis applies in federal sector age discrimination cases, but finding that complainant failed to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, recency of education can be a legitimate factor not related to age in an employment decision. However, when it is linked to other evidence indicative of age discrimination, it can support a finding of age discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Carver v. Attorney General</span>, 07A30025 (2005), the Commission found age was a determinative factor in the complainant's nonselection where the selecting official wanted to start a "junior varsity" fraud unit for attorneys who had less experience and were not near retirement age. Combined with the fact that the selectee was 13 years younger than the complainant and the fact that the administrative judge discredited the selecting official's contention that the complainant had not performed well in the interview for the job, the Commission found the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that age was the determinative factor in the complainant's nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any mention of <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, the Commission applied a mixed motive analysis to a case of age discrimination in <span class="Italic">Arroyo v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120121771 (2012), finding that there was direct evidence of age discrimination but that the agency established it would have hired the selectee even absent discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Colleague averred that he contacted the RO regarding the position asking that she consider Complainant. He provided an affidavit stating that the RO indicated that Complainant was "too old" and that she was seeking someone younger who would be around for a while. As such, she would not consider Complainant. In response to the evidence, the RO denied having the conversation with the Colleague or making the specific comments. We note that the RO and the Colleague both noted that they had no negative feelings towards each other. We also note that the RO merely stated "No maam" or "I have no preference on that." The RO failed to expand on any questions. Further, the Investigator did not appear to press the RO on the issue beyond the initial question. Based on the totality of the evidence provided, we find that Complainant has provided direct evidence of age-based discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The federal sector prohibition against age discrimination requires that "all personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (emphasis added). Under this broad prohibition, liability is established where older age is a motivating factor for the agency's decision, regardless of whether the agency also has a legitimate reason for its employment decision. As such, based on the evidence above, we find that the Agency is liable for Complainant's non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once liability is established in a mixed motive claim under the ADEA, the Agency has an opportunity to limit damages by demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073300 (Dec. 18, 2009) (clear and convincing standard applies to Agency's effort to limit relief after liability is established in a Title VII mixed motive claim); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(b)-(c) (noting in a variety of contexts that where there is clear and convincing evidence that the challenged personnel action would have been taken even absent discrimination, the agency still is required to eliminate any discriminatory practice and ensure that it does not recur). If the Agency is able to make this demonstration, Complainant is not entitled to personal relief, i.e., damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or back pay, but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees or costs. <span class="Italic">See Smith, supra</span>, (citing <span class="Italic">Walker v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980504 (Apr. 8, 1999)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here the evidence shows that the Agency did show by clear and convincing evidence that the personnel would have taken place absent discrimination. The RO, the SO and the Human Resources Specialists all averred that the Agency, based on an agreement with the Union, provide for first consideration to be given internal candidates. Based on this consideration, the RO looked at the certificate of eligibles and noted that two internal candidates could be selected. One candidate refused the position. As such, the RO considered the Selectee. The Selectee was a known employee who had good evaluations and reputation for customer service within the Agency. As such, the RO chose the Selectee for the position in question. Complainant attempted to show that the Agency only interviewed the Selectee. However, it does not appear that the Selectee was given a specific interview for the position but was contacted about his interest in the position in question. As such, the Commission is not persuaded by Complainant's argument. Upon review, we find that the Agency has shown that it would have taken the same action absent discrimination. Accordingly, we determine that the Agency has limited its liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In denying reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Arroyo v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520120563 (2013), the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the previous decision and the entire record, the Commission finds that the request fails to meet the criteria of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(b), and it is the decision of the Commission to deny the request. In response to the Agency's contention that the Commission erred in its analysis, the Commission has long held that the legal framework established by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v, Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) for proving a Title VII claim are also applicable in proving an age discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Carver v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50025 (Aug. 8, 2005); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970009 (Apr. 20, 1998). In <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.,</span> 557 U.S. _____, 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), the Supreme Court reviewed the statutory language of the ADEA's prohibition of discrimination "because of age, set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), which applies to private sector employers. Based on this language, the Court concluded that for a plaintiff to ultimately prevail in a private sector ADEA claim, he or she must demonstrate that "but for" age the alleged discriminatory employment action would not have occurred. The Court then concluded that this causation requirement precludes the application of a mixed motive analysis to claims arising under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we note that another section of the ADEA applies to the prohibition of age discrimination in the federal sector. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (all personnel actions in federal employment "shall be made free from any discrimination based on age"). Contrary to the holding in <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, the decision in <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Gates, Secretary of Defense</span>, 2010 WL 774965 (ED. Tx. March 1, 2010) held that Gross applied to private sector employment and not employment by the federal government. The court in <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> found that the different language in the two sections of the ADEA demonstrated that Congress intended different meanings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> court determined that based on its plain meaning of the language "free from any" must be construed as being broader than "because of," such that the "mixed motive analysis" continues to apply in age discrimination claims against the federal government. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, we find that the Commission was correct in its analysis of this matter and that the decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120121771 remains the Commission's decision. There is no further right of administrative appeal on the decision of the Commission on this request. The Agency shall comply with the Order as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1468"></span>In evaluating whether age was the determinative factor, the Commission will evaluate all of the circumstances surrounding the personnel action at issue. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060054 (2008), the Commission found that the complainant was the victim of age discrimination in his nonselection for a veterans outreach worker position where the selectee was under 40 years of age and the complainant was 69. In addition to the fact that the complainant and the selectee received identical scores from the screening panel, the Commission found the notes of the panel members showed that age was the determinative factor where they indicated the selectee was chosen because of her "energy" and she was "young" and "flexible." The notes also indicated that the selectee was from the "younger generation" and could converse with the "talk of new veterans."</p>
