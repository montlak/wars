<h2 class="h2"><i>DOUGLAS</i> FACTORS</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">When determining the appropriate disciplinary penalty for an employee, managers must evaluate and balance the <i>Douglas</i> factors &#x2013; a set of 12 factors set forth by the Merit Systems Protections Board in the 1981 case <i>Douglas v. Veterans Administration</i>. If managers do not work with HR to properly consider all the relevant factors, the MSPB may reverse the agency's imposed penalty and require the manager to repeat the entire disciplinary process with an appropriate <i>Douglas</i> analysis. The last thing you want is to have an employee reinstated because the <i>Douglas</i> analysis was insufficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some agencies require managers to fill out specific paperwork when analyzing the <i>Douglas</i> factors, while other agencies provide a <i>Douglas</i> <a href="file:///CF3/index.jsp?contentId=5010&chunkid=387856">worksheet</a> to guide the analysis. Whichever method your agency uses, you are not alone when balancing these factors. Your HR department provides support and is available to answer questions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You are on the frontline and therefore have the most direct knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the misconduct. Once you decide to pursue discipline, follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Collect sufficient information to be able to work with your agency's human resources department.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Discuss the action with HR to determine an appropriate penalty to recommend.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Draft the proposal letter. A proposal letter is done properly if it thoroughly explains how the agency balanced the relevant factors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">After the employee is given the opportunity to reply to the proposal letter, the deciding official will base the ultimate disciplinary decision on the information you presented in the proposal letter and the employee's reply. When the deciding letter reflects your <i>Douglas</i> analysis, you will have been instrumental in having a significant impact on the ruling.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The MSPB perspective.</b> The MSPB will uphold the agency's penalty determination so long as the agency conducts a thorough <i>Douglas</i> analysis and selects a reasonable penalty based on the evidence. Therefore, it is critical that you examine each disciplinary situation on a case-by-case basis and evaluate those factors that are relevant to the particular circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As the proposing official, you must analyze whether each relevant factor weighs in favor of the employee (a mitigating factor) or against the employee (an aggravating factor). There may also be neutral factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your <i>Douglas</i> analysis will be considered by the deciding official, and it should thoroughly support your recommendation. The following information explains how to approach the analysis for each of the 12 factors, including examples of aggravating and mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> If you want to rely on aggravating factors as the basis for imposing a penalty, those factors must be included in the proposal notice so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond before the deciding official. If the employee doesn't get notice of any aggravating factors you use to support an enhanced penalty, an <i>ex parte</i> communication with the deciding official has occurred. This may constitute a due process violation because it potentially deprives the employee of notice of all of the evidence being used against them as well as the opportunity to respond.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 1: Nature and seriousness of the offense.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>The nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even though the MSPB does not assign a particular weight to each of the <i>Douglas</i> factors, the most important factor in determining the appropriate penalty is arguably the nature and seriousness of the offense and its relationship to the employee's duties and responsibilities. Depending on the offense and employee's position, the seriousness of the offense can outweigh any mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While this factor may unofficially carry more weight, it is not advisable to rely on it solely to determine the penalty. Without question, you should act quickly to initiate the removal of an employee if the misconduct is so egregious that it jeopardizes the health and safety of your employees. However, when considering most cases, it would be a mistake for managers to look no further than the seriousness of the offense for penalty determinations. Even if you consider the offense to be heinous, the MSPB may not agree.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether the nature and seriousness of the offense is a mitigating or aggravating factor, you should consider:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the offense was intentional;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the offense was frequently repeated;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the offense blatantly violated agency policy;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the offense was illegal; and</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any other relevant facts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of serious misconduct that outweighed other factors:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The MSPB found that a postmaster's improper accounting practices were serious and intentional. The agency also had the right to expect a higher standard of conduct from a supervisor than a nonsupervisory employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee claimed pay under two different pay systems for the same hours of work in an offense of dishonesty committed for personal gain. Removal was within the maximum limits of reasonableness based upon charges of failure to follow instructions and fiscal irregularities, despite a clean disciplinary record and nine years of service, because the employee lacked rehabilitative potential.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee received better-than-satisfactory performance ratings, numerous annual performance awards, and occasional special act awards. While these are mitigating factors, it was found that they do not outweigh the seriousness of the offense, which involved three violations of the department's ethical conduct standards and failure to disclose required annual financial forms.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee's 29 years of creditable service, 26 years with the agency, and his superior work record were outweighed by the seriousness of his misconduct. The employee was removed for having continued conversations of an unwarranted sexual nature with a coworker, even after being directed repeatedly to stop this behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">In other cases, the seriousness of the offense may not be sufficient to warrant an aggravated penalty:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee took out more cash via ATM withdrawals than the amount authorized as a cash advance. Mitigating a 30-day suspension to 15 days, the MSPB found the 30-day suspension to be quite severe for a technical offense that did not result in any loss to the government, any personal gain for the employee, or any demonstrated harm to the agency's administration of the travel card program.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 2: Employee's position.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Employee's position, including job level, type of employment, supervisory or fiduciary roles, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The MSPB has long held that certain employee positions can be weighed as an aggravating factor if the job imposes a higher standard of conduct such as:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Supervisors and managers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals who advise managers, such as attorneys, HR, and EEO professionals.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Law enforcement officials.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Individuals who have contact with the public even occasionally or intermittently.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Other individuals with fiduciary duties.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The rationale behind this factor centers on the agency's need for confidence in an employee's ability to perform the duties of the specific position. Individuals with certain responsibilities who commit serious offenses call their trustworthiness into question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you use this factor to justify a more severe penalty, explain why you believe the individual's position was subject to a higher standard of conduct and discuss:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee's job level, including title, series, and grade.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The duties and responsibilities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee served as a supervisor.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee served in a position of trust or substantial responsibility. Positions of trust include jobs with supervisory, law enforcement, and fiduciary responsibilities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> To what extent was the offense related to the position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples showing how an employee's position can be an aggravating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The agency demoted a supervisor for spending an excessive amount of work time using the Internet for personal use and saving sexually explicit material on his government computer. The MSPB upheld the demotion because the misconduct was serious, raised concerns about the employee's ability to function as an effective supervisor, and the individual served as a role model for employees and enforced rules against computer misuse and access to sexually explicit materials.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The agency removed the employees from the position of supervisory police officers based on charges of conspiracy and lack of candor. The officers conspired to falsify firearm tests so that all police officers would be reported as having qualified, they took firearm tests for other applicants, and then allegedly lied about it when investigated. The MSPB upheld the removal decision after finding that these supervisors occupied positions of trust and responsibility, and the agency was entitled to hold them to a higher standard of conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">In theory, an employee's position could be a mitigating factor in the right circumstances, but generally, if it does not weigh against the employee, then the factor will likely be neutral. In either case, you still must explain your reasoning.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 3: Past disciplinary record.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Past disciplinary record, including both offenses related and unrelated to the employee's current misconduct.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Past discipline is an aggravating factor, while lack of past discipline is a mitigating factor. If you are relying on past discipline when determining the penalty, you must cite the prior discipline in the current disciplinary action's proposal letter. In addition, to rely on past discipline, the MSPB requires that:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee was informed of the action in writing.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee had an opportunity to have the action reviewed by an authority different from the one that took the action.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The action was made a matter of record.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, past discipline meets these requirements if the employee received notice of the action in a proposal letter, had an opportunity to respond, and received a final decision letter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Actions involved in a pending grievance or equal employment opportunity complaint can also be used. Although the MSPB independently reviews prior pending disciplinary actions, it also has a policy of not relying on disciplinary actions that have already been overturned in grievance proceedings at the time of board review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When relying on past discipline, you also should:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Ensure the past discipline cited in the <i>Douglas</i> analysis is not expired. Agencies may not cite disciplinary actions that have expired according to agency regulations or a collective bargaining agreement. Your agency may tell you whether certain discipline has an expiration date in the employee manual, the table of penalties, or in another source. The safe bet is to consult HR to obtain your agency's discipline expiration policy, if any, along with any related collective bargaining agreements for union employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Give notice in the proposal letter of the intent to use past discipline to determine the penalty. This will satisfy the requirement to provide notice and an opportunity for the employee to respond to any past discipline considered in the penalty determination. Prior <a href="file:///CF3/index.jsp?contentId=5010&chunkid=214454">letters of warning</a> and counseling may also be used if they are mentioned in the proposal letter. The employee's official personnel file will have information on past disciplinary actions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Consider past disciplinary actions even if the offenses are not related to the current charges. However, unrelated past discipline should weigh less than similar misconduct. Note that OPM's regulations say that agencies should consider an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all applicable prior misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Know that a past disciplinary record involving behavior similar to the current offense indicates that the employee has been put on notice that the agency will not tolerate such behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Not use past discipline to prove the current charge, only in determining a reasonable penalty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Weigh a lack of prior discipline as a significant mitigating factor. Nonetheless, a lack of prior discipline can still be outweighed by other aggravating factors depending on the circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples showing past discipline as an aggravating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was removed for insubordination involving disrespect, insolence, and like behavior to her supervisor. She was previously counseled about her sarcastic and disrespectful behavior and warned that such behavior would not be tolerated in the workplace. She also was suspended for 30 days for abusive, discourteous, and disruptive behavior in the presence of supervisors and coworkers. The MSPB found that because she had a past disciplinary record involving similar behavior, she was put on notice that such behavior would not be tolerated by the agency.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A prior disciplinary record consisting of a letter of admonishment for misconduct helped support a demotion penalty against a supervisor who misused government resources by saving 71 nude or sexual pictures on the hard drive on his official government computer.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A prior disciplinary record that included a seven-day suspension for alleged absence without leave helped show that a removal penalty was reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 4: Past work record.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">An exemplary past work record can be a mitigating factor while poor performance may be an aggravating factor. When determining whether an employee's past work record weighs in favor or against the employee, consider:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The length of service with the current organization.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The length of service with the federal government overall.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The performance appraisals and ratings over the past few years.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee was dependable.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee's current performance is acceptable. Agencies may use poor performance occurring after the adverse action proposal in their <i>Douglas</i> analysis to show an overall poor work record.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the agency promoted the employee or allowed the individual to continue working after learning of the misconduct. An agency's promotion of an employee or allowing him to perform his duties for an extended period of time after learning of his misconduct can indicate that his overall work record outweighs the seriousness of the offense.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Some managers make the mistake of finding that a lengthy service record is an aggravating factor because the employee should have known better. However, you should consider longer service a mitigating factor. Also, length of service with the agency may be weighed more than length of service with the government as a whole.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When offenses involve supervisory misconduct, the length of service as a supervisor is more important than length of service with the agency. You should consider a record of good or superior performance as a mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of past work record as an aggravating or mitigating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An information technology manager was removed for timekeeping discrepancies when compared to her assigned work schedule and for failure to obtain approval before certain absences, in violation of the agency employee manual. The employee had been employed for 19 years with no disciplinary history and had received numerous employment awards, including one nomination for employee of the year. The Federal Circuit agreed with the MSPB's decision to uphold the removal based on the seriousness of the misconduct, supervisory role, job responsibilities, and notice of the violated rules.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee, who reviewed bids to purchase homes, falsified loan application forms, lied during an inspector general investigation into a bid submitted by someone who previously lived with her, and loaned that person the money to purchase the property by taking out a personal loan herself. She inherited that property after that person's death but failed to disclose the ownership of the property and the personal loan on the required financial disclosure forms upon receiving a promotion. Upholding the removal, the MSPB found that her reputation as an excellent performer, better than satisfactory performance ratings, and occasional special act awards did not outweigh the seriousness of the offense and the other factors.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An investigator made false statements about his unauthorized use of an official government vehicle against the agency's standards of conduct when he had two beers with dinner and returned to the parking lot to find his vehicle damaged. The MSPB mitigated a removal to a 45-day suspension partially based on his very good 24-year federal career, which indicated he would continue to provide efficient service. The employee's misconduct involved only isolated incidents, which occurred while he was experiencing significant personal and emotional stress and suffering from a medical condition that likely impaired his judgment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 5: Ability to perform in the future.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Ability to perform in the future, including the effect of the offense on the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence in the employee to perform assigned tasks.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability to perform in the future is a factor to be considered in most offenses. When considering how the offense affects the employee's ability to perform, managers should look at whether the offense will impede the employee from completing his duties. Relevant facts include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee can still perform the job duties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the supervisor still has confidence in the employee's ability to perform the job.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the offense casts doubt on the employee's ability to uphold the organization's mission.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the offense reflects adversely on the individual's reliability, veracity, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee had supervisory responsibilities. Offenses inconsistent with an employee's supervisory responsibilities call into question his ability to function as a supervisor in the future.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee shows a lack of candor. Lack of candor is a serious offense that strikes at the heart of the employer-employee relationship, disrupting the ability of the employee to function effectively in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Offenses directly related to an employee's duties raise questions of confidence in the ability of the employee to perform those duties in the future. This is especially true when you take into consideration the mission of your agency. For example, if an employee falsifies documents that they have a responsibility to review, they seriously compromise the trust you have in them to properly review those documents in the future.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Think about the impact of the misconduct before considering the employee for a leadership position. The MSPB is not likely to be convinced that the misconduct caused the agency to lose confidence in an employee if that person is assigned a particularly responsible or important task after the agency becomes aware of the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When preparing the proposal letter, document the extent to which confidence is lost and explain the reasons for weighing ability to perform in the future as an aggravating factor. It's particularly helpful if you can document that the employee was aware of certain procedures and chose to not follow them. Such a situation should have a negative impact on your confidence in that employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of ability to perform in the future as a mitigating or aggravating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee pleaded guilty in federal court to knowingly transporting stolen fossils and excavating fossils without valid permission. The administrative judge mitigated the agency's demotion to a 14-day suspension because the agency promoted the employee even though it was aware of his off-duty misconduct. The MSPB concluded that the agency could not then claim that it lost trust and confidence in the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was responsible for reviewing employment documents and security investigative forms completed by other applicants and employees but falsified his own employment documents and security investigative forms. The MSPB upheld his removal because the offense adversely affected his credibility and the agency could not continue to have trust in his integrity and honesty.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Difference of opinion about ability to perform in the future.</b> Imagine you're the deciding official who's now considering the evidence and weighing the Douglas factors, and lower-level supervisors still think highly of the employee's work performance and retain trust in the employee's ability to perform. But you and higher-level management officials have concerns about the impact the misconduct has on the agency as a whole.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whose opinion will prevail if the adverse action is carried out and the employee appeals it to the MSPB?</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Character letters.</b> First let's look at how this type of situation plays out. Typically, a proposal letter's aggravating factor section states that due to the employee's misconduct, the agency has lost trust and confidence in the employee's ability to perform their job duties. To counter such a claim and turn Douglas factor 5 from an aggravating factor to a mitigating factor, the employee or their representative will solicit character letters from the employee's supervisors and coworkers. Since the lower-level supervisors have firsthand knowledge of the employee's work record, this is powerful evidence that despite the misconduct, the employee can effectively perform job duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If upper management learns that an employee is asking supervisors for character letters, they should not discourage them -- implicitly or explicitly -- from getting involved. The employee has the right to secure affidavits, which includes evidence to address the Douglas factors. In addition, the enforcement of a directive prohibiting supervisors from voluntarily providing character statements could result in a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Penalty determination belongs to the agency.</b> Since supervisors shouldn't be discouraged from writing character letters for the employee, how should you handle the situation? As the deciding official, you should still consider the letters in determining the appropriate penalty. However, the weight you give to character letters ultimately depends on the seriousness of the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The MSPB has held that the penalty judgment belongs to the agency, not to an employee's supervisor. As long as you, as the deciding official, have considered all of the relevant Douglas factors, a supervisor's opinions are insufficient to overcome the agency's judgment concerning the seriousness of the misconduct and the appropriateness of the penalty imposed by the agency.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 6: Consistency with other penalties.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The evaluation of the <i>Douglas</i> factor consistency with other penalties is often referred to as the disparate penalty analysis. It requires comparing the penalties imposed on other employees who engaged in the same or similar misconduct -- referred to as "comparator employees" or "comparators" -- with the situation of the employee at issue to ensure that the agency does not knowingly and unjustifiably treat employees differently.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To properly consider consistency with other penalties, you need to identify other employees who engaged in the same or similar offenses and consider the penalties imposed in those cases when determining the appropriate penalty in the action you are proposing now. Appropriate comparators are employees whose misconduct and/or other circumstances closely resemble those of the employee against whom you are proposing the action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There must be a close connection between the misconduct or some other factor for an employee from another work unit or supervisory chain to be a proper comparator for disparate penalty purposes. In most cases, employees from another work unit or supervisory chain will not be proper comparators. However, the MSPB has made clear that a comparator does not always have to be in the same work unit or under the same supervisor. To narrow down which employees to use as comparator employees in your disparate penalty analysis, work closely with HR to find prior disciplinary actions that are the most similar to the current act of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Weighing seriousness of different acts of misconduct.</b> You should not compare penalties where the other employees engaged in misconduct that was "as serious as" or "more serious" than the offenses committed by the employee in the case at issue. Appropriate comparators would be employees who engaged in the same or similar offenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, if the employee is charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana and was arrested near agency property, another employee who was charged with possession of marijuana only and was not arrested on or near agency property, but also attempted to smuggle marijuana into a prison facility, is not an appropriate comparator. You should not attempt to weigh the relative seriousness of various offenses in order to determine whether two employees who committed different acts of misconduct were treated disparately. Only employees who engaged in same or similar offenses are appropriate comparators.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In your analysis:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Determine which employees have similar records and committed the same or similar offenses when selecting comparator employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Explain the similarities and differences of the chosen comparator employees using the <i>Douglas</i> factors.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Outline why you have chosen the selected penalty. Managers should include the reasons why certain individuals were dismissed from qualifying as comparators, especially in ambiguous situations. If you choose a more severe penalty than those given to comparator employees, explain why.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Explain your reasoning well because employees who feel that they have been unjustifiably treated differently are more likely to bring claims of discrimination. In addition, the MSPB will not hesitate to send the case back and require you to repeat the disciplinary action, mandating a thorough explanation of why the penalties for similarly situated employees were different.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of consistency with other penalties as a mitigating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was removed for improper conduct and a felony conviction for unlawful possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) while the comparator was not removed or otherwise disciplined for a felony conviction involving unlawful possession of a controlled substance (marijuana). The MSPB mitigated the agency's removal to a 90-day suspension finding that a more serious penalty was not justified even though the agency argued the employee's misconduct involved a more serious drug.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee received an unsatisfactory safety performance after he had a traffic accident while operating an agency vehicle. The offense was his second accident involving a postal vehicle in less than two years, an eight-month period of time elapsed between accidents, and the accident was found to be preventable and the employee's fault. The comparator held the same position at the same work location, was charged twice with unsatisfactory safety performance because of accidents causing damage to a postal vehicle, also had eight months between accidents, and had an accident that was found to be preventable and the employee's fault. The MSPB vacated the removal and remanded for new penalty determination, finding a substantial similarity between the employee's charged behavior and the comparator's charged behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was removed for conduct unbecoming an officer. The MSPB mitigated the removal to a 14-day suspension after the employee raised the issue that other employees had not been fired for the same misconduct. The other employees were under different supervisors. The board said that just because the discipline is under different deciding officials doesn't mean it's acceptable and that the agency has the burden to explain why the decisions are different.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 7: Consistency with table of penalties.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Consistency of penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties, including the charge most closely matching the current misconduct and the range of suggested penalties.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency's discipline policy may utilize a chart that sets forth a recommended range of penalties for certain offenses. This is known as the table of offenses and penalties or the penalty table.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This table can provide you guidance by showing the appropriate penalty range in proportion to the charge. For example, a table may show that on a first offense of absence without leave an employee may be reprimanded. On the second offense, the table may indicate that the employee be suspended for up to five days. After the third offense, the table may recommend that the employee be suspended for at least five days, and removal should be considered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The penalty table is advisory only, and your agency can deviate from it if exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated. However, the <i>Douglas</i> analysis must thoroughly explain the reasons for the deviation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the sake of consistency, consult your agency's penalty table for the relevant offense. Then determine whether the particular circumstances justify an enhanced penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, deviation from the table might be appropriate where:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee has a record of prior offenses even if unrelated to the current offense.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is privy to sensitive intelligence and information impacting the agency's mission and national security.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The consequences of the employee's lapse are serious and far-reaching.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is a law enforcement officer who is held to a higher standard of conduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The nature of the misconduct strikes at the core of the position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">When explaining this factor in your proposal letter, be sure to discuss:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The charge(s) against the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The most closely related charge(s) in the table of penalties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The recommendation from the table of penalties for a first, second, and third offense.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If applicable, that the penalty recommended falls within the range of the table.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The reasons for choosing a recommended penalty or deviating from the recommended penalty. If you're recommending a more severe penalty, be sure you have extensive documentation and justification based primarily on aggravating <i>Douglas</i> factors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Sometimes the table may not have a charge that fits your employee's circumstances. If that happens, you can refer to charges that fit most closely to your situation as the basis for your <i>Douglas</i> analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of deviations from the table of penalties:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was removed after an incident in which he left for lunch and did not return for four hours. The Federal Circuit found that the agency properly considered two prior suspensions for unrelated offenses -- fighting and intoxication -- in determining that removal was the proper penalty. The agency's departure from its table of penalties was permissible because the employee had a prior record of fighting and intoxication. Although fighting and intoxication are unrelated to leaving the workday for four hours, the agency may use prior unrelated offenses as a basis for deviating from the table of penalties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was demoted for conduct unbecoming an officer after writing a parody that included sexually explicit passages and implied several identifiable officers were lesbians. The Federal Circuit explained that the table was far from comprehensive and did not cover the distribution of sexually explicit material. For the closest charge, the table suggested a five-day suspension. The court upheld the agency's demotion, considering the employee's supervisory position, the nature of the misconduct, and his lack of remorse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 8: Notoriety and impact.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency, including the publicity surrounding the misconduct and coworkers' ability to continue working with the employee.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notoriety of an incident should combine with other <i>Douglas</i> factors for a greatly enhanced penalty. Negative publicity or even the potential for notoriety can be especially damaging to agencies, as the public is less likely to trust the government after having its reputation tarnished by being associated with an employee's wrongdoing. In today's technological information age, once the damage is done, the Internet records any damage to the agency's reputation, making the incident easily accessible today and in the future.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To improve public perception, agencies often must allocate resources to combat the negative publicity and reestablish trust in the government. Consequently, negative publicity directly affects the agency's ability to efficiently operate and fulfill its mission. Therefore, when adverse publicity identifies the offender as an agency employee, you should consider notoriety and impact as an aggravating factor justifying more severe discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notoriety does not always involve the press and public. At times, enough people within the agency may know about the employee's misconduct to cause a negative impact on the agency's operations. When coworkers are reluctant to work with the individual, the misconduct impedes the agency's mission and operations. For example, coworkers may not want to work with an employee who is convicted of soliciting prostitutes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of notoriety and impact on the agency as an aggravating or neutral factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The impact of negative publicity was an aggravating factor in a penalty determination where an employee sent sexually explicit emails from his agency email address to constituents with whom he had developed relationships on behalf of the agency. The misconduct occurred at a time when agency customer relations was suffering and compromised the public image of the agency he was supposed to represent.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Notoriety and impact was an aggravating factor when the agency experienced negative publicity after a supervisory border patrol agent failed to ensure that subordinate agents ran a criminal record check prior to releasing an undocumented immigrant who was apprehended at the Mexico-U.S. border.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A supervisory tax technician was disciplined for the unauthorized access of an employee's tax account information. Although the offense was directly related to the agency's mission, the MSPB did not find that notoriety and impact was an aggravating factor because there was no evidence suggesting the misconduct resulted in adverse publicity outside the agency or that the offense had an impact on the reputation of the agency or the agency's mission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 9: Clarity of notice.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense or was warned about the conduct in question.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees may be disciplined only for conduct that they knew or should have known violated agency rules. The key is whether there is evidence that the employee was informed of the rule before the incident. Notice is not always clearly defined, and it need not be formal or in writing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Clearly, when one of your employees receives multiple express warnings concerning deficiencies in their behavior or they have a past disciplinary record involving a similar offense, then that employee has been put on notice that the behavior is not acceptable. But if an employee is able to show they were not made aware that their conduct was against the agency's policy, there is a chance that the penalty will be mitigated. For example, an employee's removal for off-duty use of a government vehicle may be mitigated if it was not clear they had been informed that off-duty use was not permitted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Neither you nor your agency is required to warn employees about behavior they should know is improper. However, if you intend to start enforcing rules that have not been enforced in the past, you must give clear notice to your employees that the previously condoned activity is no longer condoned. This will give employees the opportunity to conform to any new rules and enable you to impose discipline for infractions that occur after that notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In determining whether clarity of notice is an aggravating or mitigating factor, consider:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee should have known the conduct was improper without being specifically told, and if so, why the individual should have known.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee was aware their actions or behaviors were inappropriate.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> How notice was provided, such as during a meeting or through email, a policy issuance, or another method.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee received multiple warnings about deficiencies in behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee received prior counseling or prior discipline for similar behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the activity was previously condoned and, if so, whether the employee had an opportunity to conform to the new rules.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee was trained on expected behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples showing the employee had clear notice that the behavior was not condoned.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The deciding official properly found that an employee was on notice that refusal to report for duty when on call is misconduct that, by itself, warrants removal because he was previously suspended for refusal to report.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The clarity notice is satisfied when the critical duties listed in an employee's core personnel document requires honesty and integrity in the federal workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee was on notice that further misconduct would result in more severe disciplinary action when the individual was previously suspended for a similar offense.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 10: Potential for rehabilitation.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Potential for rehabilitation, including whether the employee shows remorse; takes responsibility and reports the misconduct; has a pattern of behavior vs. isolated incidents; responded to prior discipline; and has sought treatment for related medical conditions or other personal problems.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">When analyzing an employee's potential for rehabilitation, managers must determine whether the employee learned from the misconduct and will not repeat the wrongdoing. The agency may mitigate a penalty when the employee shows rehabilitative potential. In contrast, a lack of rehabilitative potential is a significant aggravating factor that could outweigh other mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You may wonder if an apology carries enough weight to be a mitigating factor. The key determination is when the employee shows remorse or fesses up to the wrongdoing. Usually, when an employee comes forth and notifies the agency of misconduct prior to any investigation, it will weigh more significantly as a mitigating factor as it demonstrates a potential for rehabilitation. But when an apology comes after the investigation, it will likely be too little, too late.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, when an employee started to cry during a hearing before an administrative judge, the AJ recognized her tearful expression of remorse as a factor and mitigated the employee's removal to a 120-day suspension. However, the MSPB found that the employee's remorse was not made until after the agency had conducted its investigation and had proposed to take disciplinary action against her. The board reinstated the removal and found the employee's remorse to be of little mitigating weight.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if the potential for rehabilitation is found, it does not outweigh the seriousness of the offense or the impact the misconduct has on an agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Consider the following when weighing the employee's potential for rehabilitation:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether the employee shows remorse or a lack of remorse.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee takes responsibility for the misconduct and reports it immediately.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether there is a pattern of behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee's response to prior disciplinary attempts.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If a medical condition contributed to the misconduct, whether the individual sought treatment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee is seeking assistance from an employee assistance program.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of rehabilitative potential as an aggravating or mitigating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A security specialist's potential for rehabilitation was slight where the employee refused to take responsibility for her actions and made false statements in response to the notice of proposed removal.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee had three prior suspensions of three, 10, and 60 days for failure to observe a written instruction, failure to carry out instructions, insubordination, making a false statement, discourtesy, absence without leave, disrespectful and inappropriate behavior, and failure to report for work while on call. The deciding official properly concluded that since the past discipline had failed to improve the employee's behavior, he was unlikely to improve his conduct and had little, if any, potential for rehabilitation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee's potential for rehabilitation was low when the misconduct was serious and prolonged, he posted material on his website that demonstrated a deep-seated antipathy toward his colleagues and supervisors, and he did not fully acknowledge his wrongdoing or the gravity of his misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee's long-term potential for rehabilitation was uncertain where the agency previously warned the employee that his profanity and his comments regarding various nationalities were offensive but the warnings only had a temporary effect.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee served an agency for a substantial period of time without prior discipline, had a good work ethic, and immediately reported an incident of misconduct and took responsibility for his actions. It was found that he showed a good potential for rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 11: Mitigating circumstances.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense, such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, and bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many managers concentrate solely on aggravating factors when proposing or taking action against employees. While it's good to be as detailed as possible to draw the correlation between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service, don't dismiss or treat as less important the circumstances that may mitigate the conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You must show real consideration of mitigating factors in order to illustrate your thorough analysis. This usually requires that you go deeper than just reporting that the employee has a number of years of service and that you considered their last three performance appraisals. Your proposal letter should show that in addition to the offense, you considered issues such as personal challenges the employee may be dealing with and whether the misconduct was provoked. To do any less will swing the door open for the MSPB or an administrative judge to mitigate the penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The most common mitigating circumstances raised by employees are:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Unusual job tensions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Personality problems.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Mental impairments.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Bad faith.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Malice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Provocation on the part of others involved in the matter.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any other factor reasonably related to the offense.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">When raised by the employee, agencies must consider these mitigating circumstances. Therefore, your best strategy is to review the employee's reply and other relevant notes to determine the mitigating factors raised by the employee. Then document your consideration of those factors. If a severe penalty is still justified, document that justification specifying the relevant <i>Douglas</i> factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b><i>De minimis</i> value of item in theft situation.</b> The MSPB has found that the de minimis nature of a theft -- for example, in one case, a store worker stole a couple of boxes of laundry detergent which had a value of $13.99 -- may be a significant mitigating factor when the employee has a satisfactory work record and no prior discipline. The board also will consider whether the employee had mere access to the item or custody and control of it. If the employee had custody and control of the item, a more severe breach of trust is involved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> The MSPB will consider whether your agency took note of all mitigating factors that may be raised by the employee. If those mitigating circumstances are not related to the misconduct or discipline imposed, they may be set aside.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if strong mitigating factors exist, the most severe penalty -- removal -- may still be justified if the offense is serious enough and other <i>Douglas</i> factors support a severe penalty. In your analysis, consider:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the misconduct was due to a medical condition. A medical condition is a mitigating factor only where it played a part in the charged conduct such as prescription drug use that causes the misconduct. However, even a significant medical condition may not be a mitigating factor if the condition cannot be controlled or remedied. Although drug addiction is a medical condition, an employee's untreated addiction is more likely to be an aggravating factor. Treated addiction may qualify as a mitigating circumstance, including counseling and rehabilitation programs for drug or alcohol addiction.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee was experiencing job-related tensions, personal problems, emotional problems, or stress. These conditions may be mitigating factors but require some evidence showing the problems contributed to the misconduct. However, stress cannot be viewed as a mitigating factor when the misconduct involves illegal drug use.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the misconduct was an isolated incident or part of a pattern. The fact that an employee's misconduct involved one continuing incident rather than a pattern or practice of insubordination and that they disobeyed an order to continue helping a customer are mitigating factors in determining a penalty for insubordination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the misconduct arose from bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter. Examples include trickery, deceit, and insults by the employee's personal relations, coworkers, or supervisors, which results in the employee's misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee brought the misconduct to management's attention.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of mitigating circumstances that weighed in the employee's favor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The MSPB mitigated a demotion to a letter of reprimand after finding the agency failed to prove the employee violated the Privacy Act and only a disrespectful conduct charge could be sustained. The MSPB found mitigating circumstances when the supervisor contributed to the conflict by raising his voice and failing to conduct himself in an appropriate manner and knew that the employee suffered from anxiety and depression.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The MSPB mitigated a 30-day suspension to 15 days for the technical offense of obtaining travel advances that exceeded the amount authorized when the misconduct did not result in any loss to the government, any personal gain to the employee, or any demonstrated harm to the agency's administration of the travel card program.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When the agency removed the employee for lying to a supervisor, the MSPB found the circumstances weighed in favor of mitigation to a 60-day suspension. The employee was a veteran; worked for the division for 11 years and served for 23 years in the Navy; had excellent work performance; was promoted; worked extensively on developing the training manual for lock operators and developed job descriptions for lock and dam personnel; and had not received prior discipline for falsification.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Factor 12: Availability of alternative sanctions.</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">When looking at the availability of alternative sanctions, you must determine whether a lesser penalty would also deter future misconduct. However, this factor does not require your agency to choose the minimum sanction available for the offense. As the proposing official, you and the deciding official need to show you considered lesser penalties and then made a reasoned decision that the more severe penalty was more appropriate and reasonable in light of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In demonstrating your reasoning, you must show that you considered the relevant <i>Douglas</i> factors in your explanation of why a lesser penalty would not deter future misconduct, or if an alternative sanction would also deter misconduct, then why your chosen penalty is still reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Start your analysis by first determining whether an alternative sanction is available. Then determine whether the alternative penalty would make the employee think twice about repeating the offense. If no, explain why the other penalty would not be sufficient. If yes, then explain why you believe your chosen penalty is still reasonable. In your analysis, use and explain the relevant <i>Douglas</i> factors, including:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The nature of the misconduct, which could be severe enough to warrant removal, even where alternative sanctions are available.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Prior warnings and reprimands, which may indicate that a penalty less than removal will not deter the employee from similar misconduct in the future.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the agency designed the penalty to make an example of an employee. Penalties designed to make an example out of the employee generally will not be upheld and do not warrant overlooking other relevant <i>Douglas</i> factors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples.</b> Here are examples of availability of alternative sanctions as an aggravating or mitigating factor:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Upholding the agency's removal penalty, the MSPB found the agency had no reason to believe that a penalty other than removal would be sufficient to alter an employee's behavior. The employee was previously counseled about her sarcastic and disrespectful behavior, warned that such behavior would not be tolerated in the workplace, suspended for 30 days for similar behavior, and showed no remorse and took no responsibility for the misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The MSPB mitigated a removal to a 45-day suspension. In the past, the agency imposed suspensions, not removals, for at least as serious misconduct by law enforcement officers who are subject to a higher standard of conduct. The employee had a very good 24-year federal career, and there was little to suggest that he would not continue to provide efficient service if he were returned to duty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Analysis strategies for deciding officials</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">While understanding the details of the individual <i>Douglas</i> factors is important to conducting a thorough penalty analysis, you also need to take a bigger picture look at how to conduct the analysis when you are acting as the deciding official. Let's take a look at some strategies you can use to avoid making mistakes in your overall <i>Douglas</i> factors analysis:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. Show conscious consideration of the factors.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">As the deciding official, you must consciously consider the <i>Douglas</i> factors. Don't just tailor your analysis to get to the desired outcome or "rubber stamp" the proposing official's analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If your agency's standard procedure is to have the proposing official do a detailed <i>Douglas</i> factors analysis, you may be tempted to simply adopt the analysis without consciously considering the factors yourself. Failing to conduct a thorough, independent analysis could lead to two potential problems if the employee appeals the action to the MSPB:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> First, the administrative judge could find you, as the deciding official, did not consciously consider the <i>Douglas</i> factors and mitigate the penalty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Second, the AJ could find a due process violation if evidence shows you considered an aggravating factor that was not mentioned in the proposal letter. Agencies must provide employees notice and a meaningful opportunity to reply to all aggravating factors considered by the deciding official. However, if the deciding official admits at the hearing that he considered an aggravating factor not mentioned in the proposal letter, the AJ could reverse the agency's discipline. The agency would then need to provide the employee a new constitutionally correct adverse action procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The deciding official should include in the decision letter an analysis of the employee's oral or written reply to the proposed action to show that a meaningful opportunity to respond was provided. You also can document conscious consideration of the <i>Douglas</i> factors by ensuring the decision letter is detailed and any <i>Douglas</i> factors worksheet used shows a specific analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also, make sure that anything you mention in the decision letter as an aggravating factor was in the proposal letter. If it was not, before issuing a decision, you should issue another letter explaining the aggravating factor to the employee to provide notice and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. Have a collaborative team meeting to work on the <i>Douglas</i> factors analysis.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may have various procedures for conducting the <i>Douglas</i> factors analysis. The best practice would be to have a meeting or conference call that includes the deciding official, the employee relations specialists, and agency counsel. During that meeting, walk through all 12 <i>Douglas</i> factors and again explain how you view each particular factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Essentially, you would be going through what would be like a direct examination by an agency representative during a potential appeal to the MSPB. This will ensure that you, as the deciding official, consciously considered the factors. This process also will help spot any error you may have made in considering the <i>Douglas</i> factors and highlight potential due process violations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here's an example: You say that you considered the employee's 30 years of federal service as an aggravating factor. The ER specialist can correct you on the spot by explaining that years of service is always a mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Or, you say you want to consider prior discipline -- for example, a three-day suspension for AWOL that was not mentioned in the proposal letter -- as an aggravating factor. The ER specialist will be able to immediately flag the potential due process violation -- relying on an aggravating factor the employee was not given notice of in the proposal letter -- and issue a letter providing the employee with notice and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not only would this meeting help show conscious consideration of the <i>Douglas</i> factors and help avoid any due process concerns because everyone will be looking out for any issues, but it also will help you with your testimony if the action is appealed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>3. Be wary of using processes that produce documents that are subject to discovery during an appeal.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an ER specialist helps you with your decision letter via email, going back and forth on the <i>Douglas</i> factors, those emails are discoverable. This means the employee could get those emails if the action is appealed, and it could show a potential due process violation. In addition, it's likely less efficient to handle this via email rather than a call or meeting.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You also have a duty to preserve any evidence, so you cannot simply destroy any documentary evidence afterwards. If evidence is destroyed, the AJ could draw an adverse inference -- that is, a negative conclusion -- against the agency. In addition, you might lose credibility if the documents produced do not show that you consciously considered the relevant factors.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Your <i>Douglas</i> analysis is the linchpin of your penalty decision, but these take-aways will help document your thorough consideration of the relevant <i>Douglas</i> factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume that supporting documents are unnecessary.</b> Depending on the factor, you will likely need to support your assertions with supporting documents.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Forget to explain why a factor is neutral.</b> You must still explain why the factor does not weigh for or against the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to check the table of penalties.</b> Use the table of penalties as a guideline for an appropriate penalty for the offense. Explain why the recommended penalty is appropriate.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Cite expired disciplinary actions when analyzing past discipline.</b> Agencies may not cite disciplinary actions that have expired according to agency regulations or a collective bargaining agreement. Check with HR to determine whether the past discipline is expired.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to consider the significance of the nature and seriousness of the offense.</b> The most important factor in determining the appropriate penalty is the nature and seriousness of the offense and its relationship to duties and responsibilities. Depending on the offense and employee's position, the seriousness of the offense can outweigh any mitigating factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is a <i>Douglas</i> factor analysis?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The <i>Douglas</i> factor analysis refers to the part of the disciplinary process when the agency must determine a reasonable penalty by analyzing the facts and circumstances. Managers must evaluate and balance the <i>Douglas</i> factors -- a set of 12 factors set forth by the Merit Systems Protection Board. Without a proper <i>Douglas</i> factor analysis, the MSPB may overturn your agency's penalty determination and require you to repeat the entire disciplinary process. Check with HR to determine whether you need to use specific paperwork when conducting a <i>Douglas</i> analysis. Managers must explain whether and why each factor weighs against or in favor of a reduced penalty. If a factor is not relevant or weighs neutrally, managers should explain their reasoning.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Is every <i>Douglas</i> factor relevant to each set of circumstances?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Not every <i>Douglas</i> factor is relevant to each set of circumstances, but officials must still explain why they believe a certain factor is irrelevant. You must document your reasoning so that the MSPB knows that you actually thought about the factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How do I know which instances of past discipline to consider?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> To obtain information on past discipline, consult with HR to ensure you have the relevant information from the employee's official personnel folder. To rely on past discipline, the MSPB requires that:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> The employee was informed of the action in writing.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> The employee had an opportunity to have the action reviewed by an authority different from the one that took the action.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> The action was made a matter of record.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, past discipline meets these requirements if the employee received notice of the action in a proposal letter, had an opportunity to respond, and received a final decision letter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How do I know who to use as a comparator employee when analyzing the consistency of penalties?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Work with HR to figure out which employees are comparator employees by determining which actions are most similarly situated to the current disciplinary action. Employees are similarly situated when the nature of the misconduct and the other factors are similar enough to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency should impose similar penalties. OPM's regulations state that appropriate comparators to be considered are <i>primarily</i> individuals in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, who engaged in the same or similar misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does my penalty have to conform to the table of penalties?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> In certain situations, an agency may impose a more severe penalty than the one recommended by the agency's table of penalties, so long as the <i>Douglas</i> analysis thoroughly explains the reasons for the deviation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Must an employee be given notice of any aggravating factors that will be used to support an enhanced penalty?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Withholding those factors from the employee can be considered <i>ex parte</i> communication with the deciding official and may constitute a due process violation. It potentially deprives the employee of notice of all the evidence being used against him and the opportunity to respond to it.</p>
