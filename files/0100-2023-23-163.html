<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-158"><span class="space">C.</span> PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY A DISABILITY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant is able to establish that his or her deficient performance is the result of an agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation the agency will not escape liability, as the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Michelle G. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120132463 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that S2 claimed that Complainant had "ample opportunity and assistance to improve." The record, however, refutes that assertion. The Agency removed Complainant from a quiet work space in November or December 2008 and did not return her to a quiet location until June 2010. Complainant, who previously had performed at an "Outstanding" or "Exceeds Fully Successful" level, notified S2 on February 9, 2010, that she was experiencing work difficulties because of a medical condition. S2 has acknowledged that she became aware of Complainant's October 2008 reasonable-accommodation request in March 2010. Ultimately, the Agency denied Complainant's request for reasonable accommodations such as communication with the Lead or manager on an as-needed basis and a modification in the manner in which she performed telephone duties and entered history notes. Rather than provide Complainant with "ample opportunity," the Agency denied Complainant an equal opportunity to attain an acceptable level of performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, therefore, that the Agency unlawfully denied Complainant a reasonable accommodation for her disability. We further find that the Opportunity to Improve letters and negative performance feedback were the direct result of the Agency's failure to provide Complainant with reasonable accommodation. By issuing the letters and feedback, the Agency penalized Complainant for its failure to provide her with reasonable accommodation that would have enabled her to perform the essential functions of her position. Accordingly, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of disability when it issued negative performance-related letters and memoranda after Complainant submitted her request for reasonable accommodation. Given that Complainant stated that she submitted the request in April 2010 and that Psychiatrist 2 signed the Agency's reasonable-accommodation form on April 13, 2010, we will order the Agency to remove the letters and written performance counseling issued after that date from Complainant's official personnel record.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Marx H. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120162333 (2018), the Commission found that where the agency was aware that the complainant's performance deficiencies were caused by a disability but still disciplined her for those deficiencies, the agency's actions were punitive and "tantamount to suspending her because she had a disability." In that case, the complainant suffered from Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia, resulting in "major impacts on thought processing and the time it took to complete tasks." The complainant was suspended for failing to timely complete assignments shortly after she revealed to management that she had a mental condition and requested an accommodation. Finding discrimination, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Marx H</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 3, we reiterate that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Additionally, Complainant was suspended only a couple of weeks after management learned that she had a mental condition and requested accommodation of that condition. Moreover, the Agency acknowledges that Complainant was reprimanded because she did not complete assignments in a timely manner, although it was aware that her Dementia caused her to need more time to complete assignments. Under these circumstances, we find that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> of disability discrimination case for claim 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the Agency now has the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for suspending her. As stated above, the Agency maintains that it suspended Complainant because she did not complete assignments in a timely manner and made errors in her work products. However, we note that on August 11, 2014, Complainant informed the Agency that she had Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia, and that the condition affected her thinking processes, which caused her to take much longer to complete tasks. Complainant's job largely consisted of performing tasks that necessarily involved composing documents and typing. As such, from August 11, 2014, the Agency was aware that Complainant needed significantly more time to complete her assignments, and Complainant's failure to complete assignments by deadlines and work product errors were mostly attributable to her mental condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Agency suspended her for work errors and failing to complete assignments in a timely manner after it was aware of the impact of Complainant's condition on her work performance. We note that Commission guidance holds that an agency may discipline an individual with a disability for violating a conduct standard, even if the misconduct resulted from the disability, as long as the conduct standard is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span>, No. 915.002 (Mar. 25, 1997), at question 30 ("an employer may discipline an employee with a disability for engaging in...misconduct if it would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability"). However, work product errors and untimely completion of work assignments are not matters of misconduct; they are matters of performance. Thus, the appropriate manner to respond to such matters is through measures designed to address performance problems, such as appraisals, remedial training, non-disciplinary counseling, and Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When, as here, an agency is aware that performance problems are caused by a disability but disciplines an employee for those performance problems, the Agency's actions are punitive against the employee's status as an individual with a disability. Therefore, under these circumstances, we conclude that suspending Complainant for five days was tantamount to suspending her because she has a disability. Therefore, we find that the Agency has not provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for suspending Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Natalie v. Dep't of Veteran's Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12679 (Aug. 22, 2002) (Agency's decision to discipline Complainant's instead of providing an accommodation is not a legitimate non-discriminatory explanation). Thus, we conclude that the Agency failed to rebut the inference of discrimination created when Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Therefore, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant based on her disability when it suspended her for five days.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Nicki D. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0720180023 (2021), the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act is to allow an individual with a disability to work with or without reasonable accommodation, we would be remiss to allow the Agency to rely on Complainant's alleged performance deficiencies, during periods when she did not have an accommodation, as a basis for finding her not qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing whether the complainant was a qualified individual, the Commission noted that her work performance only became problematic when her request for telework was delayed. Finding the complainant's removal disability-based discrimination in <span class="Italic">Nicki D</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to claims 3 and 4 concerning Complainant's removal from federal service. For Complainant to prevail on her claim of disparate treatment, she must satisfy the three-part evidentiary scheme fashioned by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Complainant must initially establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by demonstrating that she was subjected to an adverse employment action under circumstances that would support an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Furnco Constr. Co. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). Proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will vary depending on the facts of the particular case. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804 n.14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination under a disparate treatment theory, Complainant must demonstrate that: (1) she is an "individual with a disability" (2) she is "qualified" for the position held or desired; (3) she was subjected to an adverse personnel action under circumstances giving rise to an inference of disability discrimination and/or denied a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Josiah M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019003865 (Feb. 14, 2020).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment on the basis of reprisal, Complainant must show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the Agency was aware of the protected activity; (3) subsequently, she was subjected to adverse treatment by the Agency; and (4) a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120132503 (Aug. 28, 2014), <span class="Italic">citing Whitmire v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00340 (Sept. 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Cmty. Aff. v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). Petitioner must ultimately prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency's explanation is pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993); <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This established order of analysis, in which the first step normally consists of determining the existence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, need not be followed in all cases. Where the agency has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the personnel action at issue, the factual inquiry can proceed directly to the third step of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis, concerning the ultimate issue of whether Complainant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's actions were motivated by discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Herb E. v. Equal Emp. Opp. Comm'n</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120171699 (Nov. 27, 2019); <span class="Italic">see also Charlie K. v. Equal Emp. Opp. Comm'n</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120142315 (Jan. 24, 2017), <span class="Italic">req. for recons. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520170235 (Dec. 19, 2017); <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 713-714 (1983); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Request No. 05900159 (June 28, 1990); <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., EEOC Request No. 05900467 (June 8, 1990); <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03900056 (May 31, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, we find that the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. With regard to the removal action, our review of the record shows that the Agency removed Complainant from federal service due to her poor performance. Specifically, the Agency alleged that Complainant, among other things, failed to: understand the laws enforced by the Commission; follow her supervisor's instructions; ensure the accuracy and completeness of case data in the Integrated Management System; provide sufficient analysis; and properly assemble case files. The Agency also alleged that Complainant was not receptive to constructive criticism.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, Complainant now bears the burden of establishing that the Agency's stated reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shapiro v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960403 (Dec. 6, 1996). Indicators of pretext include, but are not limited to, discriminatory statements or past personal treatment attributable to those responsible for the personnel action that led to the filing of the complaint, comparative or statistical data revealing differences in treatment across various protected-group lines, unequal application of Agency policy, deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification, or inadequately explained inconsistencies in the evidentiary record. <span class="Italic">Mellissa F. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141697 (Nov. 12, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing pretext, Complainant contended that the removal action was pretext for discrimination based on disability. Specifically, Complainant disputed S1's characterization of her work, and she maintained that S1 poisoned S2's impression of her by selectively providing S2 with biased feedback. Complainant also maintained that no management official other than S1 observed her work performance. Complainant asserted that S1 subjected her discrimination because she had requested a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the AJ credited Complainant's version of events. In this regard, while the AJ considered the Agency's explanation that Complainant's removal was due to performance reasons, the AJ found that the probative evidence failed to support that assertion. Having reviewed the record, the AJ found that the Agency's removal action was based on discriminatory animus because the record clearly showed that Complainant performed at the "fully successful" level in the months prior to her request for reasonable accommodation, but that assessment in the months following Complainant's requests for reasonable accommodation declined. In rejecting the Agency's assessment of Complainant's work, the AJ noted that the Agency did not provide Complainant with any specific warnings about her performance, did not issue her any performance letters, and never counseled her in an official setting. Furthermore, the AJ credited the hearing testimony of Complainant's third-level supervisor, who testified that the removal action was based on the erroneous assumption that Complainant was receiving reasonable accommodation. The AJ concluded that the Agency, in failing to timely provide Complainant with reasonable accommodation, had essentially deprived Complainant of the opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. The AJ reasoned that to hold Complainant accountable for performance deficiencies during periods when she did not have accommodations would be contrary to the Rehabilitation Act's purpose of allowing individuals with disabilities to work with or without accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Complainant's reprisal claim, the AJ found that the evidence established that Complainant was subjected to discrimination in reprisal for engaging in protected activity (requesting a reasonable accommodation) when she was terminated from her Investigator position with the Agency. The AJ's decision to find reprisal relied on the close proximity between Complainant's request for an extension of her accommodation both in January and February of 2015 and again in May of 2015 and her subsequent termination, along with the finding that the Agency provided little to no evidence of performance problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency contends that the AJ erred in finding that Complainant was deprived of the opportunity to show that she could perform the essential functions of her position with or without accommodation. To the contrary, the Agency vehemently maintains that Complainant in fact was receiving her requested accommodation when her performance deficiencies manifested. Furthermore, the Agency asserts that Complainant's second-level supervisor independently reviewed Complainant's work and found it to be deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration, we find substantial evidence to support the AJ's decision. While we considered the Agency's contention that Complainant in fact was receiving accommodations when her performance deficiencies manifested, we agree with the AJ that the probative evidence fails to show that the Agency effectively accommodated Complainant. In this regard, we note that Complainant first requested reasonable accommodation on August 27, 2014 and was removed from federal service on May 14, 2015. The record reflects that during this 260-day period, the Agency only allowed Complainant to telework for a total of 85 days (November 18, 2014-January 18, 2015 and March 2, 2015-March 27, 2015). Given that Complainant was not allowed to telework for the vast majority this period, we agree with the AJ that the Agency's failure to accommodate played a significant role in Complainant's performance deficiencies. Moreover, while we acknowledge that there is a dispute as to whether acted S1 acted with discriminatory animus, and whether S1's discriminatory animus tainted the decisions of S2 and 3, we note that the AJ considered the evidence presented by the parties, weighed the evidence, and concluded that S1's discriminatory animus irreparably tainted the removal action. As we find substantial evidence to support the AJ's decision, we decline to second guess the AJ's findings of fact. Accordingly, we conclude that Complainant has successfully shown that the Agency's articulated reasons were pretext for discrimination on the alleged bases.</p>
