<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-198"><span class="space">P.</span> TAXES ON COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The issue of taxes on Title VII and ADEA awards has been subject to both Supreme Court decisions and IRS rulings. The issue is also discussed, in depth, in the section above on taxes under the general heading of "<span class="blue">Backpay--General</span>" and the reader is referred to that discussion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through Pub. L. No. 104-188, the Internal Revenue Service Code's definition of gross income was amended. Previously, compensatory damages for emotional distress were excluded from the definition of gross income and, thus, not taxable. However, the amended IRS Code provides that damages now are excluded from gross income only to the extent that they are compensation for emotional distress caused by physical injury or sickness. <span class="Italic">See</span> 26 USC 104(a)(2). In December 1996, the IRS clarified its position on the new legislation through the issuance of Rev. Rul. 96-65. Unless the compensatory damages are reimbursement for medical or other out-of-pocket expenses, they now are taxable. The ruling applies to all compensatory damage awards received on or after June 14, 1995, the effective date of the amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a short-lived decision that could ultimately have far-reaching implications in federal sector EEO cases, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declared unconstitutional a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that includes damages for emotional stress within the definition of gross income for tax purposes. In <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 460 F.3d 79 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the court struck down a 1996 revision to the IRS tax code finding it violated the Sixteenth Amendment. Although the case involved a whistleblower complaint brought under statutes enforced by the Department of Labor and not a discrimination complaint, the court's holding could have readily applied to federal sector EEO cases with compensatory damage awards. However, several months after deciding the case, the same panel granted a rehearing petition and reserved its ruling. In <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 493 F.3d 170 (D.C. Cir. 2007), the panel, without explaining how it could have so fundamentally misinterpreted the law in the first place, reversed its ruling.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff in the case, Marrita Murphy, was awarded a total of $70,000 in compensatory damages by a DOL administrative law judge. The award acknowledged that Ms Murphy had suffered both emotional distress and physical manifestations, such as teeth grinding and shortness of breath. The ALJ broke the award down to $45,000 for emotional distress damages and $25,000 for injury to professional reputation. None of the award was intended to compensate the plaintiff for lost wages or diminished earning capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ms Murphy challenged section 104(a)(2) of the IRS code, which was amended in 1996. Under the amendment, damages for physical injury remained excluded from the definition of gross income, but damages for psychological distress were included in that definition. In the first <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> decision, the Court rejected an argument by Ms. Murphy that at least part of her damages award was nontaxable because it was compensation for physical injury because the ALJ, although noting the physical effects of the retaliation, did not make separate award for physical injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, turning to Ms. Murphy's arguments under the Sixteenth Amendment, the Court found that IRS could not tax the damages award as "incomes" under the Amendment because the award was not intended to compensate her for lost wages or earnings. The Sixteenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, gave Congress the power to "lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived,..."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court in <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> first rejected the government's argument that the Amendment gave Congress the sole power to define income:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we reject the Government's breathtakingly expansive claim of congressional power under the Sixteenth Amendment-upon which it founds the more far-reaching arguments it advances here. The Sixteenth Amendment simply does not authorize the Congress to tax as "incomes" every sort of revenue a taxpayer may receive. As the Supreme Court noted long ago, the "Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact." Indeed, because the "power to tax involves the power to destroy," it would not be consistent without constitutional government, and the sanctity of property in our system, merely to rely upon the legislature to decide what constitutes income.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having rejected the government's claim to virtually unfettered discretion in defining incomes, the Court shifted its focus to what the damages award was intended to compensate Ms. Murphy for and what the understanding to the term incomes was when the Sixteenth Amendment was passed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have seen, it is clear from the record that the damages were awarded to make Murphy emotionally and reputationally "whole" and not to compensate her for lost wages or taxable earnings of any kind. The emotional well-being and good reputation she enjoyed before they were diminished by her former employer were not taxable as income. Under this analysis, therefore, the compensation she received in lieu of what she lost cannot be considered income and, hence, it would appear the Sixteenth Amendment does not empower the Congress to tax her award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That emotional distress and loss of reputation were both actionable in tort when the Sixteenth Amendment was adopted supports the view that compensation for these nonphysical injuries was not regarded differently than was compensation for physical injuries and, therefore, was not considered income by the framers of the Amendment and the state legislatures that ratified it. By 1913, in at least 39 of the then-48 states and in the District of Columbia, the law made compensatory damages for "mental suffering" recoverable in the same manner as compensatory damages for physical harms; indeed, in 34 of those states, there are reported cases involving defamation and other reputational injuries-the very sort of injury Murphy suffered-and at least five more states allowed an action for alienation of affections, also a nonphysical injury. As a result, we see no meaningful distinction between Murphy's award and the kinds of damages recoverable for personal injury when the Sixteenth Amendment was adopted. Because, as we have seen, the term "incomes," as understood in 1913, clearly did not include damages received in compensation for a physical personal injury, we infer that it likewise did not include damages received for a nonphysical injury and unrelated to lost wages or earning capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Albert Einstein may have correct that "[t]he hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax." <span class="Italic">The Macmillan Book of Business and Economic Quotations</span> 195 (Michael Jackman ed., 1984), but it is not hard to understand that not all receipts of money are income. Murphy's compensatory award in particular was not received "in lieu of" something normally taxed as income; nor is it within the meaning of the term "incomes" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment. Therefore, insofar as &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) permits the taxation of compensation for personal injury, which compensation is unrelated to lost wages or earnings, that provision is unconstitutional. Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court to enter an order and judgment instructing the Government to refund the taxes Murphy paid on her award plus applicable interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court then granted the government's petition for rehearing in the case. The Court in the second <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> decision held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject Murphy's argument in all aspects. We hold, first, that Murphy's compensation was not "received...on account of personal physical injuries" excludable from gross income under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). Second, we conclude gross income as defined by &#x00A7; 61 includes compensatory damages for non-physical injuries. Third, we hold that a tax upon such damages is within the Congress's power to tax.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court first rejected any notion that a portion of the damage award was for physical ailments finding that, at best, the ALJ had considered the physical ailments as evidence of the level of the plaintiff's emotional distress. In a decision heavy on the constitutional underpinnings of taxation, as well as tax law and its historical development, the Court ultimately reversed field and found that Congress has properly defined a damage award as being within the meaning of gross income and can, therefore, tax it. A petition for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in the matter was filed before the Supreme Court and rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that it is not a breach of a settlement agreement providing for a lump sum in compensatory damages for the agency to report the amount paid to the Internal Revenue Service. In <span class="Italic">Deal v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 01986663 (1999), the Commission also determined the complainant had not shown the agreement should be voided because of mutual mistake of fact over the taxability of compensatory damages. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Deal</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1962"></span>The Commission also finds that complainant has not shown that he was intentionally misled into entering the agreement, that the agency acted fraudulently, or that the agency has acted in bad faith. Complainant has not persuasively shown that the agency purposely misled him about the status of the law regarding the taxability of compensatory damage awards. Furthermore, the agency's reporting of the compensatory damage payment to the Internal Revenue Service as income does not constitute bad faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although complainant has not claimed that the parties' belief about the taxability of compensatory damage awards constitutes a mutual mistake of fact or law, the Commission shall examine this issue on its own motion. The Commission finds that the record does not show that there was a mutual mistake of fact or law. It can not be determined with any reasonable degree of certainty what exactly complainant believed was the status of the law regarding the taxability of compensatory damages, prior to entering into the settlement agreement. Furthermore, it is not clear from the record that either party has made a mistake in the ultimate issue as to whether this particular compensatory damage payment is taxable. Finally, complainant was aware there was an issue regarding the taxability of compensatory damages, yet he failed to include a provision in the agreement concerning such taxes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Watts v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120092390 (2009) (agency did not violate order of administrative judge by reporting damage award to IRS and "a tax reporting matter like this is between the complainant and the IRS.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of taxability of damages should be specifically addressed in the settlement agreement. See also, section on "<span class="blue">Tax Consequences on Back Pay and Damages</span>" and "<a href="0100-2023-30-008.html#sec21-9">Compensatory Damages</a>," above, and "<a href="0100-2023-14-032.html#sec5-32">Lump Sum Payments</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-14-068.html#sec5-68">Compensatory Damages"</a> in Chapter 5.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the Internal Revenue Code excludes from the definition of gross income compensation for emotional distress caused by physical injury or illness there has been some question as to the taxability of a compensatory damage award for physical pain and suffering. Without any specific analysis, in <span class="Italic">Bunton v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a41740.txt">01A41740</a> (2005), the Commission rejected the request of a complaint to classify part of a damages award as compensation for physical injuries and sickness noting "that it is beyond [the Commission's] purview to categorize this award in terms of its potential federal income tax ramifications."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected a similar appeal in <span class="Italic">Kessel v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0420110014 (2013), even though IRS had advised the complainant to seek clarification from the Commission:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner requests clarification of her non-pecuniary damages award. Specifically, after receiving a 1099 form from the Agency dated April 20, 2011, the IRS notified Petitioner that the $65,000 non-pecuniary damages award was all taxable and is subjecting Petitioner to interest and penalties on the amount. Petitioner contends that the non-pecuniary damages award "were based on some of the physical symptoms endured by [Petitioner] that resulted in long-term and permanent physical injuries and sickness," and as a result asked the IRS to reconsider. The IRS notified Petitioner that she could seek clarification from the Commission, and the IRS would consider that clarification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1995, the IRS amended its definition of gross income to provide that damages are excluded from gross income only to the extent that they are compensation for emotional distress caused by physical injury or sickness. 26 U.S.C. 104(a)(2). The IRS clarified that unless compensatory damages are reimbursement for medical or other out-of-pocket expenses, they are taxable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; Rev. Rul. 96-65; <span class="Italic">Watts v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092390 (Oct. 8, 2009) (The Commission took administrative notice that IRS instructions for the Form 1099-MISC require items to be reported as "other income" include "all compensatory damages for nonphysical injuries or sickness, such as employment discrimination....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bunton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A41740 (July 19, 2005), Petitioner requested that her compensatory damages be classified as "personal physical injuries" or "physical sickness" so that her award would not be considered part of her gross income and subjected to income tax. The Commission denied Petitioner's request, and noted that it was beyond the Commission's purview to categorize this award in terms of its potential federal income tax ramifications. We have also found that given that the taxation of compensatory damage as gross income is governed by complex tax laws, regulations, rules and guidance, a tax reporting matter like this is between the Petitioner and the IRS. <span class="Italic">Watts, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With that said, we will note that in our underlying decision we found that Petitioner's non-pecuniary compensatory damages were partially based on physical injuries that she suffered as a result of the Agency's discrimination. Specifically, we stated that Petitioner was "inflicted with mental anguish and physical ailments because of the harassment and retaliation that she was subjected to." We also specifically discussed the physical injuries that Petitioner suffered, which were a large basis for Petitioner's non-pecuniary compensatory damage award. For example, Petitioner's physical injuries included: high blood pressure; colitis; bouts of severe diarrhea; difficulty sleeping; aching; inability to eat; inability to talk; crying; jumpiness; and inability to function. However, we find that it is beyond our purview to determine how much, if any, of the $65,000 that we awarded Petitioner in non-pecuniary compensatory damages should be considered taxable gross income.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is not entitled to an additional damages award because the initial damages award has tax consequences. In <span class="Italic">Vashi v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420060009 (2007), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner seeks damages for the adverse tax consequences of the total damages award, apparently also including interest and compensatory damages. The Commission has held that, under both legal and equitable theories, an award to cover additional tax liability from a lump sum payment of back pay is available to complainants. <span class="Italic">Van Hoose v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982628 and 01990455 (August 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Goetze v. Department of Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (August 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Holler v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982627 and 01990407 (August 22, 2001). We note, however, that the Commission has not recognized any entitlement to awards to cover tax liability for interest and compensatory damages. In the case of a lump sum back pay award, individuals are compensated for the extra tax they are required to pay as a result of receiving a lump sum award, as opposed to the actual amount they would have to pay if they had received the pay over a period of time, usually several years. It is the receipt of the pay in one lump sum that causes the extra tax liability, not the back pay award itself. The petitioner is still required to pay taxes; in the case of compensatory damages and interest, there is no option to receive partial payments over time. Thus, there are no additional tax consequences to awards of compensatory damages and interest, and therefore, no entitlement to compensation for such negative tax consequences. Accordingly, the petitioner's claim for compensation for adverse tax consequences is only available on any lump sum payment of back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of compensatory damages is subject to being reported to the IRS. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Emerson S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420130026 (2015), "Tax reporting of compensatory damages is between a complainant and the IRS. <span class="Italic">See, for e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Watts v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120092390 (Oct. 8, 2009) (citing, <span class="Italic">Cozzino v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A52131 (April 20, 2005)."</p>
