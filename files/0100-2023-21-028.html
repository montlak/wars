<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-27"><span class="space">c.</span> Attire and Dress</h5>
<p class="noindent">An agency may enforce its policies, including a dress code, without violating Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Majorie J. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120171044 (2018), the Commission found that demeaning comments about the complainant and her work attire were not sex-based harassment. The background in <span class="Italic">Majorie J</span>. is worth detailing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of events giving rise to this complaint, Complainant worked as a Rural Carrier Associate at the Agency's Post Office in Saltillo, Mississippi. Report of Investigation (ROI), at 5. According to Complainant, on May 17, 2015, when she returned from her route, the Postmaster (male) told her that he received a complaint from a customer that her shorts were too short. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 115. Thereafter, the next day, on May 18, 2016, the Postmaster asked Complainant not to wear the short shorts anymore and said her shorts should not be more than 4 inches above her knees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_820"></span>Complainant averred that the same day, May 18, 2016 a Rural Carrier (female) said about her, "Yup once a slut, always a slut," and said she could not sleep her way to the top. However, according to the Postmaster, the Rural Carrier denied making the statements to Complainant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 172. The Postmaster averred that he learned upon investigation that the Rural Carrier had gotten into a joking discussion with another coworker (CW1) wherein the Rural Carrier told CW1 not to act like a slut. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Postmaster opined that the comment was simply a joke between the Rural Carrier and CW1 and not directed at Complainant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A couple of days later, on May 20, 2016, the Rural Carrier came over to Complainant's work area and took several pictures of her using her cell phone. The Rural Carrier reportedly took pictures of Complainant to show that Complainant's work attire was inappropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 173. The Postmaster averred that after several carriers came to him expressing that shorts and yoga pants were not appropriate, he decided to enact a dress code. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An employee (female) observed that Complainant would wear shorts to work that "barley covered [her] bottom," feeling that her work attire was not appropriate for the workplace. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 201. Another employee averred that Complainant would dress in a low-cut tank top, as if she was dressed for the beach. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 216. A third employee (female) also believed that Complainant's work attire was inappropriate for the workplace, stating that her shorts were about 10-12 inches above the knee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 267.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Female employees also attested that Complainant would talk about her sex toys and would make sexual advances towards male employees in front of them, including the Postmaster. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 316. Female employees further observed that Complainant would allow male employees to rub-up against her and give her a back rub. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant nevertheless alleged that on May 21, 2016, the Rural. Carrier came over to her work area and sat down behind her for about 10-15 minutes trying to intimidate, harass, and scare her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 126. Complainant believed that the Rural Carrier attempted to intimate her because she complained about the Rural Carrier's actions towards her and filed a grievance the day before. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Postmaster stated, however, that this matter was not brought to his attention and that the Rural Carrier, to his knowledge, was not supposed to be working on May 21, 2016. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 175. However, another employee corroborated Complainant's allegation that the Rural Carrier was in fact in Complainant's work area on May 21, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, according to Complainant, on August 13, 2016, another Rural Carrier (female) yelled at another coworker that she was "sick of her seeing her tail because her shorts were too short." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 114. Complainant also averred that the Rural Carrier said she could not sleep her way to the top. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant further averred that on August 20, 2016, when she went to go load her car with mail to get ready to perform her route, CW1 and another coworker (female) (CW2) pulled up next to her in their respective vehicles. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant stated that is when CW2 began either recording her or taking pictures of her with her cell phone. Complainant immediately reported the matter to the SCS (male). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On September 4, 2016, the Agency conducted an internal investigation into Complainant's claims of a hostile work environment by the Rural Carrier, CW1, and CW2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the interim, on June 21, 2016, Complainant filed an EEO complaint, as amended, alleging that the Agency subjected her to a hostile work environment on the bases of sex (female) and reprisal for prior protected EEO activity when:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;A coworker stalked her and spoke to her in a demeaning manner which she believes constitutes sexual harassment;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;On May 18, 2016, a coworker called her a slut;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;On May 20, 2016, coworker entered her work area and took pictures of her;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;On May 20, 2016, a coworker made comments regarding her attire;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;On May 21, 2016, a coworker sat directly behind her at her work station; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;On August 20, 2016, a coworker took a picture of her;</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that the complainant refused to adhere to the agency's dress code, the Commission found that the complained of conduct was not sex-based harassment in <span class="Italic">Majorie J</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the alleged harassers, all of whom were female, were not motivated by sexual animus, but rather by Complainant's continued failure to adhere to the dress code and her willingness to engage in open sexual advances towards male employees in the workplace in front of them. Many female employees in the record attested that they were upset by the way Complainant dressed, and there is no dispute that a postal customer had complained about Complainant's attire as well. As such, we find that the harassment complained of was not based on Complainant's sex, and therefore we find that Complainant has not established prongs 2 and 3 of the harassment analysis. <span class="Italic">See Schmitz v. ING Sec., Futures &#x0026; Options, Inc</span>., 10 F. Supp.2d 982 (N.D. Ill. 1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 191 F.3d 456 (7th Cir. 1999) (supervisor's badgering of a female employee about inappropriately suggestive clothing and unseemly provocative behavior did not constitute sexual harassment in a manner prohibited by Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we can no evidence that the Rural Carrier called Complainant a slut as alleged. In so finding, we note that the Rural Carrier denied Complainant's version of events and the Postmaster believed that the Rural Carrier had not called Complainant a slut. Also with respect to claim 6, we note that CW1 denied Complainant's version of events of August 20, 2016, and attested that no one took a picture of Complainant that day. The Postmaster also averred that CW1 and CW2 explained the relocation of their vehicles by saying CW1 had a flat tire. We find that Complainant did not establish that events occurred as alleged. In addition, while not dispositive, we note that both CW1 and CW2 were the same gender as Complainant and there is no evidence that they were motivated by retaliatory animus. As Complainant did not request a hearing, we do not have the benefit of an Administrative Judge's credibility determinations after a hearing; therefore, we can only evaluate the facts based on the weight of the evidence presented to us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, while the Rural Carrier may have taken pictures of Complainant with her cell phone on May 20, 2016, the record reflects that the Rural Carrier did so to show that Complainant's work attire was inappropriate. Even assuming all of Complainant's allegations occurred as alleged, we note that every unpleasant or undesirable act which occurs in the workplace constitutes a discrimination violation. <span class="Italic">See Shealey v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120070356 (Apr. 18, 2011), <span class="Italic">request for recons. den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520110498 (Feb. 6, 2014); <span class="Italic">Epps v. Dept of Trans</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120093688 (Dec. 19, 2009). In this regard, we have held that the discrimination statutes are not civility codes. An abusive or hostile working environment exists "when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment." <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 65. We find that Complainant has not established that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on sex or protected EEO activity, as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Majorie J</span>. in <span class="Italic">Rebecca Q. v. Attorney General</span>, 2019001292 (2020), the Commission found that persistent comments from supervisors and coworkers related to the complainant's "excessively tight" attire was not sex-based. The complainant, an employee at a federal correctional institution for male offenders, alleged that she was subjected to sexual and sex-based harassment in the form of "excessive comments regarding her attire and figure" and management threats to discipline her. The agency found no discrimination and the Commission agreed in <span class="Italic">Rebecca Q</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find Complainant's alleged harassers, who were both males and females, were not motivated by sexual animus, but rather by Complainant's continued failure to conform to expectations regarding appropriate attire within FCI Memphis. Complainant, her parents, and another Corrections Officer gave sworn statements that Complainant's clothes were suitable for her position as Unit Secretary. On the other hand, however, many more male and female employees consistently described Complainant's manner of dress as excessively tight. Indeed, Complainant was provided an FCI Memphis windbreaker and encouraged to wear it in the workplace to obscure her preference for form-fitting styles. As such, based on the unique environment of a federal penitentiary, we find that the harassment complained of was on her perceived choice of inappropriate clothing, and therefore we find that Complainant has not established that she was sexually harassed. <span class="Italic">Majorie J. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120171044, (Aug. 3, 2018) <span class="Italic">citing Schmitz v. ING Sec., Futures &#x0026; Options, Inc</span>., 10 F. Supp.2d 982 (N.D. Ill. 1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 191 F.3d 456 (7th Cir. 1999) (a supervisor badgering an employee about inappropriately suggestive clothing and provocative behavior did not constitute sexual harassment in a manner prohibited by Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also considered Complainant's accusation that the Captain had sexually harassed her while he provided instruction during her new employee introductory course in December 2016. A fair reading of the record revealed that other employees who were present at the same training did not support Complainant's account. For example, an FCI Memphis HR Specialist observed that Complainant drew attention to herself by arriving tardy to the classes and was often distracted by her cellphone in lieu of participating or paying attention. Furthermore, the alleged supervisory harassment by the Captain cannot be imputed to the Agency because managers had been unaware of this particular complaint prior to the Agency's formal EEO investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that Complainant could not establish the Agency subjected to a hostile work environment based on sex.</p>
