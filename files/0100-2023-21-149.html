<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-137b"><span class="space">2.</span> Slurs</h4>
<p class="noindent">Generally, one incident involving derogatory comments about an employee's national origin is not sufficient to sustain a claim of harassment based on national origin. "The harassment must be sufficiently pervasive as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Tedeschi v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01841267 (1986). In finding that one incident where the supervisor called the employee a "dumb Dago" did not constitute harassment, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Tedeschi</span> reviewed several cases in an attempt to distinguish between merely objectionable incidents and harassment rising to the level of a Title VII violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another case upon which the Complaints Examiner relied was <span class="Italic">Cariddi v. Kansas City Chiefs Football Club, Inc.</span>, 568 F.2d 87, 16 FEP Cases 462 (8th Cir. 1977) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), the Court found that the use of ethnic slurs by a supervisor did not amount to a violation of Title VII. In that case, the plaintiff sued for damages for a stadium director's reference to him as a "dago" and other Italian Americans as "mafia." The Court concluded that such comments were part of casual conversations and were not so numerous as to rise to a Title VII violation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, 684 F.2d 1355, 29 FEP Cases 1259 (11th Cir. 1982), the Court affirmed a district court's finding of liability under Title VII. The plaintiff, while in a training program was assigned to a Ford dealership in Tampa, Florida. The plaintiff, a black male, complained to Ford and the dealership management about employees using racial epithets, referring to poorly-repaired cars as "nigger-rigged" and the employee with the lowest sales as the "black ass." An employee called the plaintiff a "dumb nigger" and later apologized. There were other references to "niggers" in conversations about customers.... The Court observed that "an employer violated Title VII simply by creating or condoning an environment at the workplace, which significantly and adversely affects an employee because of his race or ethnicity, regardless of any other tangible job detriment to the employee." The harassment "must be sufficiently pervasive as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment...."</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no mechanical test that can be applied to determine how many incidents are required to establish harassment. The assessment will be made taking into account the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ayuso v. Attorney General</span>, 01950345 (1997), the Commission found that the use of the term "wetback" on one occasion, without other discriminatory conduct, did not support a finding of discrimination. Although the complainant alleged that there were conflicts in the workplace and that he felt alienated the Commission did not find an ethnically hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant identifies numerous instances in which there was conflict, not only with coworkers but with supervisors, only one (being subjected to the ethnic slur "wetback") can be deemed discriminatory in nature. The others involved personal and work relationships with his coworkers and supervisors, his work performance and his feeling of alienation in the workplace. We have previously held that although we do not condone or approve of the use of discriminatory language (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span> "wetback"), a few isolated incidents of racial enmity are insufficient to support a finding of discrimination or a hostile working environment. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910009 (March 7, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that although appellant was subjected to less than acceptable behavior and conduct on the part of his coworkers and supervisors, and our prior decision found discrimination with respect to the allegations in his original complaint, appellant has failed to demonstrate that any of the incidents taken individually, or as a group, raise to the level of discriminatory conduct so intolerable that a reasonable person in appellant's position would have resigned under the circumstances. Thus, appellant has not proven that the harassment complained of resulted in his constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission found that being called "Cuban" did not constitute a national origin slur, "especially since Complainant identified his national origin as being that of a Cuban." <span class="Italic">Diego V. v. Small Business Administration</span>, 0120141712 (2016). The complainant in that case also alleged that over hearing a supervisor call a coworker an "immigrant wetback" created a hostile work environment. The Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Diego V</span>. that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we have previously held that we do not condone or approve of the use of offensive language (i.e., "wetback"), we have also concluded that "a few isolated incidents of racial enmity" are insufficient to support a finding of discrimination or a hostile working environment <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. Dept of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A41440 (June 23, 2005)("wetback," remark by itself insufficient to constitute hostile work environment where other alleged discriminatory actions were determined to have legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons); <span class="Italic">Ayuso v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950345 (Apr. 25, 1997) (complainant alleged hostile work environment, including being called a "wetback" on one occasion); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910009 (Mar. 7, 1991) (complainant must prove more than "a few isolated incidents of racial enmity").</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Raney v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01962665 (2000), discussed the level of severity and pervasiveness that ethnic or racial slurs must meet to constitute a hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that a "mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not affect the conditions of employment to a sufficiently significant degree to violate Title VII." <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986). However, a limited number of highly offensive slurs or derogatory comments may in fact state a claim or support a finding of discrimination under Title VII<span class="Italic">. See, e.g. Yabuki v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920778 (June 4, 1993) (single incident of verbal abuse and negative comment concerning Japanese people sufficient to constitute race and national origin discrimination); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996) (three racially derogatory comments over a two-month period by an individual with a history of making such statements was sufficient to state a claim); <span class="Italic">McAllister v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960416 (May 22, 1997) (a supervisor's disparaging and racist comments to complainant, in conjunction with prior comments by the supervisor demeaning to other protected classes, was sufficient to justify an AJ's finding of discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Raney</span> proceeded to find that the following statements made to the complainant, an Iranian, by his coworker, were sufficiently intimidating and hostile to rise to the level of unlawful harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_950"></span>(1) all foreigners should be incarcerated;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2) foreigners were threats to American security;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3) foreign VAMC doctors should go back to their country of origin;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4) foreign doctors knew nothing about medicine; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5) foreign doctors had no right to tell Americans what to do.</p>
<p class="noindent">Significant in the <span class="Italic">Raney</span> case was that some of the conduct occurred after issuance of a notice, following an investigation by the agency's Office of District Counsel, that the "ongoing 'interpersonal conflict' between the complainant and coworker had a serious and unacceptable effect on the operations" of the agency. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Chen v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072272 (2007) (allegations of repeated rants of coworker about Asian immigrants, failing to speak English, and pulling down eyes to mimic Asians stated claim for hostile environment based on national origin).</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the Commission's findings in <span class="Italic">Raney</span>, its findings in <span class="Italic">Muhammad v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A50741 (2006), are somewhat surprising. In that case, the Commission upheld the finding of its administrative judge that the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive where the complainant was subjected to a number of comments about being a suspected terrorist. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Muhammad</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching the conclusion that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of harassment was not made, the AJ identified allegedly harassing comments complainant stated were made by his co-workers. The AJ noted that complainant alleged that on September 19, 2001, Computer Scientist-2 asked complainant if he had been harassed; on September 25, 2001, Management Program Analyst-2 stated to another employee that "only those that look and dress like a terrorist [are] treated like a terrorist; that on October 2, 2001, the Program Analyst made a comment about "strip searching" complainant; that on October 3, 2001, the Program Analyst asked complainant "[h]ow is Afghanistan?" and "[a]re you with the Taliban?" The AJ also noted that complainant also stated in a letter that on October 30, 2001, in a meeting with complainant and four other co-workers, Employee A asked complainant if he were a Muslim and when complainant responded "yes," Employee A said the "[complainant] might be a terrorist sympathizer. I need to stop associating myself with you." Complainant then responded that Employee A was harassing complainant and that he "could get" Employee A for discrimination, to which Employee A responded that he would make certain that complainant "would be dead and not in court." The AJ noted that the comment made by Employee A was the most severe remark and completely inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission cannot find that the workplace was so poisoned with discriminatory animus and permeated with discriminatory ridicule and insult so as to have altered the conditions of complainant's employment. Nor can the Commission find that the incidents were sufficiently continuous, and not merely episodic, to be considered pervasive. Further, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to complainant and considering all complainant's claims to be true, the Commission finds that the incidents complained of were not sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to have created a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Rana v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0720060056.txt">07200600561</a> (2007), discussed in section on "<a href="0100-2023-21-129.html#sec12-120">Harassment Based on Religion</a>" above.</p>
<p class="noindent">Repeated negative references to the complainant's Cuban heritage, including calling him "Fidel," created a hostile environment based on national origin in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120120625 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statements and conduct that Complainant complains of that are, on their face, either based on or related to Complainant's Cuban national origin are...(1) the Director stated to Complainant that "these immigrants think they speak English better than us," (2) Complainant's co-worker (and the Lead Scientist), in reference to Complainant's beard addressed Complainant, [at times in the Director's presence] as "Fidel" on an undetermined number of occasions; (3) the Director said [in front of other government employees or contractors "Complainant]...is from Cuba where babies have chili peppers for breakfast," (4) the Director called Complainant to the Director's office door and, referring to a poster on the door with an image of a chimpanzee against a red background wearing a beret with a star and the words, "Viva La Evolution," alluding to a well known picture of Ernesto ("Che") Guevara, stated, "[Complainant], look, Viva La Evolution," and (5) the Deputy Director, [after Complainant cut off his beard] stated to Complainant, "Where's Fidel's beard?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> Administrative Judge's September 19, 2011, Decision (MD) at 5-26.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency admits and the record reflects that these events did occur. Based on the AJ's findings, the Agency's statements on appeal, and information obtained from the record, we agree with the AJ that Complainant's national origin (Cuban) renders him a member of a statutorily protected class, that Complainant was subjected to harassment in the form of unwelcome verbal conduct, and that this conduct was, on its face, based on Complainant's Cuban heritage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree, however, with the AJ's ruling that these events did not have the effect of creating an intimidating or hostile work environment rising to the level of actionable harassment. To the contrary, we find that such statements and behaviors in the workplace are sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment based upon Complainant's national origin and are precisely the type of workplace goings-on the anti-harassment laws seek to prevent. Therefore, we find that Complainant has demonstrated the first four elements of a viable hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in cases where ethnic slurs used in the workplace do not rise to the level of a hostile environment, they can be probative of discriminatory motivation when considered with other evidence. <span class="Italic">Juarez v. Department of Justice</span>, 01872114 (1988). In that case, the Commission found that the RMO's special assistant referred to the complainant as a "crazy Mexican" and the deputy director of the agency stated in an IRS investigation that complainant may have ties to the "Mexican Mafia." Combined with evidence of disparate treatment, the statements were probative in making a determination on the issue of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, evidence of an ethnic slur, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish pretext. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chatterjee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03920119 (1992). While the Commission found the supervisor's statement that people from the complainant's culture did not easily accept criticism was reprehensible, it was not dispositive evidence of discriminatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also applied the same liability rules to cases involving harassment based on national origin as it applies to cases of harassment on other bases. In <span class="Italic">Ammon, supra</span>, the Commission found that the agency was not liable for the hostile environment created by the supervisor because the agency immediately corrected behavior by demoting the supervisor and insuring that the supervisor would never again supervise the complainant. The Commission found that the agency "released itself from liability by taking prompt and effective actions."</p>
