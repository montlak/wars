<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-15"><span class="space">A.</span> UNTIMELY COMPLAINTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">An agency may dismiss any complaint if contact with an EEO counselor has not occurred within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory event or action, or if the complainant has failed to file a formal complaint within 15 days of receipt of the notice of final interview. 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(2). Dismissal of complaints for failure to initiate timely contact with an EEO counselor is addressed in Chapter 2, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-11-001.html#sec2-2">The 45-Day Time Limit</a>." Discussed below is dismissal of complaints for failure to comply with the 15-day requirement for filing a formal complaint after receipt of the notice of final interview.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110, at 5-18 addressed the general parameters for dismissing a complaint for untimely filing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant failed to file a formal complaint within <span class="Italic">fifteen (15) days</span> of his/her receipt of the EEO Counselor's Notice of Right to File a Formal Complaint in an individual complaint, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(d), or in a class complaint, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.204(c). The agency has the burden of proving that the complainant received the notice and that the notice clearly informed the aggrieved person of the 15-day filing time frame. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Paoletti v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950259 (Aug. 17, 1995). This time limit is also subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC begins the 15-day period from the day of receipt of the notice of final interview. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnston v. USPS</span>, 01831196 (1983). "Days" means calendar days, and includes weekends and holidays. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.604(a). The first day counted is the day after receipt of the notice of final interview. If the last day of the filing period falls on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, the time period is extended to the next business day. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.604(d). The 15-day filing period is subject to tolling, waiver, and estoppel. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.604(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency makes substantive changes to the notice of final interview after it is initially issued, the 15-day clock is reset and the employee has 15 days from receipt of the amended notice to file a formal complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Burdick v. Postmaster General</span>, 05981023 (1999), the Commission held that the 15-day clock was reset where the agency, in a second notice of final interview, amended the claims discussed with the counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the notice of final interview is received at the complainant's address of record by a family or household member of suitable age and discretion, a rebuttable presumption of receipt is raised. <span class="Italic">Doty v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A21779 (2002). Of course, when the complainant gives his work address as his address of record, receipt in the agency's mailroom creates that rebuttable presumption. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint filed by mail is deemed to have been filed as of the date of postmark. <span class="Italic">Catalano v. USPS</span>, 01831808 (1983) (complaint dismissed as untimely because it was postmarked 17 days after receipt of the notice of final interview).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complaint is delivered personally to the agency, it must be received within the 15-day period. A complaint was dismissed as untimely where it was slipped under the door of the EEO office after business hours on the 15th day. The Commission found that this did not constitute delivery to an appropriate official, as required by regulation, since the complaint could not actually have been "received" until the following business day. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Becker v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01903019 (1990). But, where an attempt is made to deliver a complaint, via runner, to an agency during its hours of normal operation, this will suffice to make the complaint timely if the agency is not open. In <span class="Italic">Vice v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01952380 (1996), the complainant's attorney attempted to have the complaint hand-delivered but the runner found the office was closed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Telefax machines as a means of transmitting documents has generated some confusion regarding time frames. Many administrative agencies accept service of documents by telefax and serve documents by telefax. Since the machines, generally, are left on after business hours, documents can be telefaxed at any time of the day or night. In <span class="Italic">DeBerry v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01966379 (1997), the Commission held that it would accept telefax transmission of complaints and that such documents would be regarded as timely filed even if received after business hours. Given the Commission's holding in <span class="Italic">DeBerry</span>, it would hardly make sense for it to continue to follow <span class="Italic">Becker</span>. This is the thrust of a minor change in the 1999 regulation amendments. The Commission changed 29 CFR 1614.604 regarding methods of filing and computation of time and replaced "delivered in person" with "received." The "change was intended to ensure that a document will be deemed timely if it is received on or before the applicable due date regardless of the manner in which it is transmitted or delivered." 64 Fed. Reg. 37,655.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it is all the same to the employee in terms of result, the Commission draws a distinction between complaints dismissed on the basis of timeliness and matters not within the EEO purview. The agency improperly dismisses a complaint as being not within the EEO purview when its reason for doing so is that the complaint is untimely. <span class="Italic">Dunlap v. Department of Army</span>, 01821665 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency dismisses a complaint on the basis of timeliness, it must include sufficient information in the dismissal to allow the EEOC to review its findings<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Lara v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01940906 (1994) (holding it is well settled that agency bears burden of collecting sufficient information on timeliness issues). In <span class="Italic">Oravec v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 01821637 (1983), the failure to elicit specific dates from the appellant on her allegations of discrimination required remand to the agency for factfinding sufficient to allow EEOC review. Likewise, when the report of informal counseling cites one date for the last incident of discrimination and the formal complaint cites another, the agency must make a factual clarification prior to dismissing the complaint on the basis of timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Glintz v. USPS</span>, 01831817 (1983). Similarly, if the agency dismisses a complaint as untimely filed, it must submit proof of the date of filing<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A20244 (2002) (dismissal as untimely reversed where the record contained no evidence of when then complainant received the notice of final interview); <span class="Italic">Holt v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A12781 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12539 (2001) (agency did not submit adequate proof where the record indicated that the notice of final interview was sent under one certified mail number, but the envelope that was returned unclaimed bore a different certified mail number).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant contends, in an unsworn statement, that he timely filed the complaint and the agency contends in an unsworn statement that he did not, the Commission does not have sufficient information to decide the matter. Under those circumstances in <span class="Italic">Fleming v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01953969 (1996), the Commission remanded the case, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends, in a written statement, that he filed his complaint in a timely manner and spoke to the Deputy EEO Officer, who confirmed receiving the complaint. The Deputy EEO Officer contends, also in a written statement, that she has no recollection of this conversation, and had no knowledge of appellant's complaint until their telephone conversation on February 22, 1995. Neither party has submitted an affidavit or any other evidence tending to support their statements. Given the state of the record, we cannot determine when appellant filed his complaint. Accordingly, we must remand this case for a supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, where the complainant provides a signed statement attesting to delivery and the agency offers only vague denials of receipt, the complaint must be deemed timely. <span class="Italic">Fitzhugh v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05980075 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">While ordinarily the burden is on the complainant to prove that he or she filed the appropriate document by the date it was due, the Commission found that <span class="Italic">Salas v. Secretary of Treasury, IRS,</span> 01963144 (1997), presented a unique circumstance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_152"></span>The timeliness determination hinges on one day; and, the record is void of any evidence of the date on which the complaint was actually received by the agency. We find this to be a sufficient reason to deem the complaint filed on February 19, 1996, the date on which the complainant signed it and which was also the date that it was due for filing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has made it clear that the burden rests upon the agency to submit sufficient evidence to support its disposition of a complaint. <span class="Italic">In re Crowe</span>, 05870362 (1987). In dismissing a complaint on the basis of timeliness, the agency must produce a copy of the notice of final interview. Note that there are two separate burdens involved in timeliness cases: the complainant bears the burden of proof on the issue of whether the complaint was timely filed, but the agency bears the burden of insuring there is sufficient evidence in the file from which a timeliness determination can be made.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the employee initiates informal counseling, she still has an obligation to cooperate with the agency during the counseling period. An employee who timely initiated informal counseling, and then went out of town for eight weeks without informing the agency, was found to have filed her formal complaint in an untimely fashion because she did not receive the notice of final interview until after her return. The EEOC found it was the employee's obligation to notify the agency that she would be out of town during the period for filing a formal complaint. <span class="Italic">Halley v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830673 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR 1614.105(b)(1) (employees must keep agency informed of their current address); 29 CFR 1614.605(e) (the complainant is responsible at all times for proceeding with complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the process is often used by laypersons without representation, the formal requirements of a complaint can be overlooked. In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902634 (1990), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint as untimely where the complainant filed a request for a hearing within three days of receiving the notice of final interview, but did not file an actual complaint within the 15-day period. The Commission found the request for a hearing should have been treated as a complaint and deemed timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">When it is undisputed that a complaint is untimely, the burden is on the employee to establish good cause for the late filing of a complaint. However, it is not a prerequisite to establishing good cause for the employee to demonstrate that she requested an extension of time. "[T]he agency should not require a formal request before considering the justification [for the untimely filing]." <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05920238 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee is entitled to rely on the advice of the agency EEO counselor. If the counselor advises the employee to delay filing a complaint at the final interview then grounds for waiving the time limits exist. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 05890648 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, there was confusion in the record as to whether the complainant had been advised to delay by the counselor, her union president, or both. The Commission found the agency should conduct an adequate investigation to determine if the counselor advised delay. But in <span class="Italic">Norris v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01976711 (1999), the Commission refused to waive the time limit where the complainant alleged he was waiting for the counselor to contact him with word on a settlement he had proposed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Norris</span> relied upon the counselor's statement that the complainant was aware that the counselor's settlement efforts did not toll the 15-day period for filing a formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">If there is any confusion created by the agency's notice of final interview, it likely will be resolved in the complainant's favor. For example, in <span class="Italic">Powell v. Federal Housing Finance Board</span>, 01A60627 (2006), the complainant specifically requested that the EEO counselor issue all communications to her in writing, using her post office box address. The counselor subsequently notified the complainant of her final interview by email, with the notice of final interview as an attachment. The email also notified the complainant that the notice was being sent by certified mail. The Commission found that the 15 days for filing a formal complaint began upon receipt of the notice via certified mail and not by email.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a short but significant decision, the Commission determined that it would waive the 15-day period for filing a formal complaint based upon the agency's misconduct in the counseling stage, even though that misconduct was not responsible for the complaint being untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See Teller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921780 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Teller</span>, the agency refused to reschedule the final interview to accommodate the complainant's representative, and made no efforts to informally resolve the complaint. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complaint based on the agency's conduct, irrespective of the fact that its conduct did not cause the late filing.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency will not be deemed to have waived its objections to a complainant's failure to comply with the time limitations by accepting and investigating a complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nickens v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01964831 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Oaxaca v. Roscoe</span>, 641 F.2d 386 (5th Cir. 1981). In many cases, an investigation is necessary to make a final determination on timeliness issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a muddled decision, the Commission appeared to hold that when a complaint is remanded to the agency for investigation of a timeliness issue, and the agency accepts the complaint issues and investigates the merits of the complaint, it will be deemed to have waived any timeliness objections. In <span class="Italic">Redfearn v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01961933 (1998), the administrative judge remanded the complaint to the agency because it was unclear why the agency dismissed some of the complainant's allegations. The judge also ordered the agency to investigate whether those allegations, and allegations that were the subject of later complaints, constituted a continuing violation. Rejecting an argument that the agency had failed to investigate the continuing violation theory, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Redfearn</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that both appellant and the AJ misapprehend the continuing violation doctrine. A continuing violation inquiry is relevant only to extending the statute of limitations where there are timeliness problems; a continuing violation will be found to exist, and the time limit for filing a complaint will be tolled, where a complainant has established a series of related discriminatory acts, one of which fell within the time period for contacting an EEO Counselor<span class="Italic">. See McGivern v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901150 (December 28, 1990); <span class="Italic">Starr v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890412 (April 6, 1989). As the agency has accepted all of appellant's allegations, there is no statute of limitations issue and the continuing violation theory does not apply. The continuing violation doctrine is not relevant to the merits of appellant's allegations<span class="Italic">. See Meros v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930760 (September 23, 1998). Accordingly, the agency complied with our decision when it issued its acceptance letter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's cryptic notation that there was no statute of limitations issue in the case because the agency accepted the allegations for investigation, left doubt as to the precise meaning of <span class="Italic">Redfearn</span>. The best interpretation of <span class="Italic">Redfearn</span> seemed to be that an agency will be deemed to have waived any timeliness objections when it is specifically ordered to investigate the timeliness issue and instead proceeds directly to the merits. It seems unlikely the Commission meant to suggest any general waiver of a timeliness defense merely by acceptance of the complaint for investigation. That conclusion was supported by <span class="Italic">Lowe v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 04970005 (1998). In <span class="Italic">Lowe</span>, the Commission found, without citation to <span class="Italic">Redfearn</span>, that the agency waived all procedural requirements for the complaint when it failed to follow the specific instructions of the Commission on remand, including instructions to investigate the timeliness of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01973318 (1998), the Commission clarified its position on waiver of timeliness issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Director, Diversity Management stated in the April 8, 1997 statement that at that June 1995 meeting he indicated to appellant that appellant's "EEO complaint would be considered timely filed, and would be processed in accordance with the applicable agency regulations." The Commission finds that the Director, Diversity Management's statement on April 8, 1997 shows that the agency waived the time limits in June 1995 for appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor in the instant matter.... The Commission finds that in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932365, <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930963 (July 21, 1994), the Commission, <span class="Italic">citing Henderson v. U.S. Veterans Admin.</span>, 790 F.2d 436, 440-41 (5th Cir. 1986), held that "where an agency makes a specific finding of timeliness, it cannot later reject the complaint as untimely." The Commission finds that the Director's statements in June 1995 was a specific finding of timeliness.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result of <span class="Italic">McIntosh</span>, it seems that an agency will be deemed to have waived any timeliness objections if it specifically makes a finding that a complaint is timely or fails to address the timeliness issue after remand by the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the administrative judge issues a finding of discrimination, an agency may not dismiss the case on procedural grounds. In other words, at that time the agency loses any timeliness defense it may have had. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Guajardo v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01956664 (1998). The <span class="Italic">Guajardo</span> case was decided prior to the 1999 regulation amendments that essentially eliminated recommended decisions making the decisions of administrative judges subject to agency appeal. However, it would make no sense for the Commission to abandon the holding in <span class="Italic">Guajardo</span> under the 1999 regulations. The argument that the agency waives any timeliness objections not raised prior to the judge's decision has even more validity under the current regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">An entire chapter of this book could be written on the dismissal of complaints on the basis of timeliness. Citation of the cases alone would take several pages. The end result is the same. With very few exceptions, complaints filed more than 15 days after receipt of the notice of final interview will be dismissed as untimely. To review the hundreds, possibly thousands, of excuses for filing a late complaint would serve little purpose. Suffice it to say there is rarely good reason for missing the deadline. The complaint form is not lengthy and can always be supplemented with more detail after it is timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discussed below are some recurring situations related to the timeliness of complaints.</p>
