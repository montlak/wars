<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-73"><span class="space">E.</span> LEGITIMATE REASONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Commission <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 (2016), further provides examples of instances that would serve to sever the causal connection in a retaliation case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if protected activity and a materially adverse action occurred, evidence of any of the following facts alone or in combination may be credited by the factfinder in a given case and, as a result, lead to the conclusion that the action was not in retaliation for the protected activity under the applicable causation standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Employer Unaware of Protected Activity</span>. Retaliation cannot be shown without establishing that the employer (either the decisionmaker or someone who influenced the decisionmaker) knew of the prior protected activity. Absent knowledge, there can be no retaliatory intent, and therefore no causal connection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Legitimate Non-Retaliatory Reason for Challenged Action</span>. An employer may proffer a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action. Examples of non-retaliatory reasons include:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> poor performance;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> inadequate qualifications for position sought;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> qualifications, application, or interview performance inferior to the selectee;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> negative job references;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> misconduct (e.g., threats, insubordination, unexcused absences, employee dishonesty, abusive or threatening conduct, or theft); and</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> reduction in force or other downsizing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though the employer does not have the burden to disprove retaliation, the employer may have evidence supporting its proffered explanation for the challenged action, such as comparative evidence revealing like treatment of similarly situated individuals who did not engage in protected activity, or supporting documentary and/or witness testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reprisal cases generally follow the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> tripartite analysis. Once a complainant demonstrates a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, the agency must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, nonretaliatory, reason for its actions. The Commission explained the basic analysis in <span class="Italic">Ifill v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113546 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To prevail in a disparate treatment claim such as this, Complainant must satisfy the three-part evidentiary scheme fashioned by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Complainant must initially establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by demonstrating that he or she was subjected to an adverse employment action under circumstances that would support an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567 (1978). Proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will vary depending on the facts of the particular case. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804, n.14. The burden then shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). To ultimately prevail, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>. 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960403 (December 6, 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra</span>). Specifically, in a reprisal claim, and in accordance with the burdens set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology</span>, 425 F. Supp. 318, 324 (D. Mass.) <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976), and <span class="Italic">Coffman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960473 (November 20, 1997), a Complainant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie case</span> of reprisal by showing that: (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the Agency was aware of the protected activity; (3) subsequently, he or she was subjected to adverse treatment by the Agency; and (4) a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. <span class="Italic">Whitmire v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00340 (September 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, an agency is required to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. The agency's explanation must be sufficiently clear to raise a "genuine issue of fact" as to whether discrimination occurred. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981). Moreover, it must "fame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that [complainant] will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255-256. <span class="Italic">Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256); <span class="Italic">see also St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502 (1993), <span class="Italic">citing U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983) and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256. While an agency's burden of production is not onerous, it must nevertheless provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for the treatment accorded the affected employee. <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1523"></span>In <span class="Italic">Ifill</span>, the Commission found that the agency had failed to articulate a legitimate reason for not permitting the complainant to wear a jacket in inclement weather where one RMO stated he had no contact with the complainant during the relevant period of time and the other stated he was not the complainant's supervisor and was on leave for most of the relevant period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly in <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120131310 (2013), the Commission found that the agency had not rebutted the complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal because he engaged in protected EEO activity, of which management was aware, and he was subjected to adverse treatment in the form of a denial of his leave request. With regard to whether or not Complainant established a nexus between the denial and his protected activity, the record does not indicate which management official denied the request and thus Complainant is denied the opportunity of establishing a nexus with a specific management official. As noted above, the management official's signature is illegible. Furthermore, we note that all management officials flatly denied any knowledge of the denial of leave. As noted above, the record shows Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity as late as February 2012 while the leave request was denied on April 14, 2012. Accordingly the denial was sufficiently close in time to establish a nexus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of production next shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the denial. <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253. The agency's explanation must be sufficiently clear and specific such that a complainant has a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered explanation is a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256). Following a review of the record we find that the Agency has failed to meet this burden. As noted above, all of the management officials interviewed flatly denied any knowledge of the leave denial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency denied Complainant the opportunity to demonstrate pretext by failing to offer a clear and specific reason for the denial of leave, the Agency failed to rebut the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> inference of discrimination. We therefore find that Complainant has established discrimination based on reprisal when his request to swap leave was denied.</p>
<p class="noindent">Uncertainty, on the part of the agency, as to why it took or failed to take an action, does not satisfy its obligation to provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">Roxane C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120142363 (2016). <span class="Italic">Roxane C.</span> involved a female complainant who was selected for a position that required her to complete a 14-week training program. The complainant subsequently informed management that she was pregnant and her due date was "within a couple of days of the final graduation exercise." Shortly thereafter, the agency expressed concerns about her attendance at the April training due to concerns regarding her pregnancy and the agency's perceived dangers related to the training program. The agency suggested that the complainant instead take an August training course. The complainant declined deferring her training to August. After protracted discussion, the agency removed the complainant from the April training roster. The complainant filed an EEO complaint, did not attend the April training course and subsequently went on maternity leave. When she returned, she found that her name was not on the August training roster. One supervisor testified that when he removed her name from the April training course, he added her to the August roster, but that upper management sent a follow-up roster that did not include the complainant as an attendee. Before the Commission in <span class="Italic">Roxane C</span>., the agency conceded that why the complainant was dropped from the August roster was an "open question," but maintained that it was immaterial because the complainant had, on several occasions, refused to attend the August training. The Commission rejected that argument, finding reprisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity by contacting an EEO Counselor and filing a formal complaint of discrimination on May 2, 2011. The management officials involved in this case were aware fact that Complainant had engaged in EEO activity. Complainant was subjected to adverse treatment in being removed from the August training she was scheduled to attend after returning from maternity leave. A nexus is established because Complainant was removed from the training, scheduled to commence in August 2011, within three months of her EEO activity in April 2011. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Dept. of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43894 (March 30, 2005) ("nexus may be shown by evidence that the adverse treatment followed the protected activity within such a period of time and in such a manner that a reprisal motive is inferred"). Therefore, Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reason for removing Complainant from the August training seems to be that management was not sure whether Complainant was interested in attending the training, and that Complainant refused to attend the training. However, the Agency concedes that it is an open question concerning who removed Complainant's name from the August 2011 training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency's reason in its brief, that Complainant's name was removed from the August roster because she refused to attend the August training, is not supported by evidence in the record. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at n.9 ("An articulation not admitted into evidence will not suffice. Thus, the defendant cannot meet its burden merely through an answer to the complaint or by argument of counsel"). Complainant did not, in fact, refuse to attend the August training subsequent to being removed from the April training. Rather, Complainant initially refused to consider attending the August training while negotiating her ability to attend the April training, which is understandable in that Complainant believed she was unlawfully being denied the opportunity to attend the April 2011 training. But there is actually no evidence in the record that Complainant affirmatively refused to attend the August training apart from her urging management that she should attend the April training, and in her request for reasonable accommodation to attend the April training. The AJ cites to Complainant's statement that the August class "was not an option," but this was stated in connection with Complainant's attendance at the April training, and before she was actually removed from the April training. As S2 explained, it was an "initial meeting." Therefore, the Agency's position that Complainant was removed because she did not want to attend the August training is not supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The actual testimony of management in the record reveals that there is no stated reason why Complainant was removed from the August training. S1 indicated that he did not submit Complainant's name for the August training: "I did not know when she was coming back. And I didn't realize that I had any part to play in submitting her name, actually. I was anticipating that someone would come to us and say, [Complainant] will be assigned...I didn't take the initiative because I didn't think it was my place to submit her. And I was frankly just waiting for someone to make a decision that she was going to go." S1 opined that it may have been an oversight that no one told him Complainant had returned to work and was available to attend training: "If someone had said that, we would have submitted her name." S1 stated that he was waiting for S4, or someone at a higher level, to inform him whether Complainant would be attending the August training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S4 indicated the following as to why Complainant did not attend the August training: "[F]rom my perspective, she was given that opportunity and then once she went to EEO and got a lawyer, we were told to remain--to go through any future working relationship with her through the EEO office. So she quickly, after she didn't like my answer, went to the EEO office and made a complaint and so from my perspective, she was offered the next class, she was scheduled to attend and, quite frankly, I was surprised she wasn't in the class." When asked whether Complainant was informed that she was enrolled in the August training, S4 explained that he did not know because he did not have any contact with her. S4 indicated that upon her filing an EEO complaint, "we were advised not to have discussions with her and that the EEO office would handle the interactions with her." This testimony provides no insight into why Complainant was removed from the August training except that management ceased communication with Complainant after she filed an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite testimony from Complainant's management to the effect that they did not know why Complainant was removed from the August training, other testimony demonstrates that Complainant's removal from the training was deliberate. The training instructor, S2, testified that he initially removed Complainant's name from the April list, and placed her on the August roster per instructions of management. However, he later received notification that she would not attend the August training: "Her name stayed on the roster until I got communication from them...So I got from them, from their office, an e-mail probably sometime in June or July that had a list of the people they wanted in the next class to confirm. See, basically they're confirming, hey do you have these people in the class. And her name wasn't on that list. And I went back to them and I said, hey, I don't have her name on the list and they said, 'Yeah, roger that.'" S2 explained that he received this information from "someone in the DXF staff" but could not recall the individual's name. S2 did not testify to the individual giving any particular reason why Complainant would not be attending the training. Similarly, a co-worker, apparently in charge of managing the training list, testified to initially placing Complainant on the August list, but then being told to remove her. This co-worker did not provide an explanation as to why he was instructed to take Complainant's name off of the list, but speculated: "I guess because everything was going on, just to wait and see if she still wants to go to August."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Complainant wanted to attend the April training and was denied the ability to do so resulting in her being unable to report to the Defense Liaison Officer position in Country X, she explains that she was never subsequently informed that she was actually registered for the August training. It is evident that Complainant's name was inexplicably removed from the August roster after having been placed on the roster. Given the record, the Agency did not sufficiently state a legitimate, <span id="Page_1524"></span>nondiscriminatory, reason for removing Complainant from the August course, giving her the opportunity to show pretext. Further, S4's comment regarding Complainant's EEO activity is evidence of retaliatory animus to the extent that he indicates that he ceased communication with Complainant regarding the training as a result of her EEO activity. Therefore, Complainant has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that she was subjected to reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency that simply asserts it can no longer use an employee with medical restrictions does not state a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. In <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01953952 (1997), the Commission chastised the agency for essentially asserting failure to accommodate as a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. In that case, the agency, after complainant's protected activity, issued a letter to the complainant notifying him of a reassignment because his work unit could no longer use an employee with medical restrictions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the agency failed to sustain its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. The agency articulated that appellant was sent the September 21, 1992 letter because officials determined that appellant's section could not continue to use an employee who had medical restrictions, that use of such employees impeded the facility's operations, and that personnel restraints therefore compelled the reassignment of appellant. Consequently, without further consideration, the agency determined that appellant's medical restrictions could no longer be accommodated. We find that the agency's blatant disregard for its duty to accommodate qualified individuals with a disability and, indeed, its blanket statement that it was going to discriminate, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, failure to continue to provide reasonable accommodation, is clearly not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Therefore, it is the decision of the Commission to REVERSE the agency's final decision and find that appellant has established that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of reprisal by issuing the letter of September 21, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the letter of September 21, 1992, was withdrawn approximately one month later, when agency officials re-assessed their earlier position, and determined that appellant's disability could continue to be accommodated as a result of an increase in personnel....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCloud v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960089 (1998), the Commission found that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate reason for its decision not to rehire the complainant where the agency asserted it had not rehired the complainant because of his prior removal. The agency further asserted it had a policy of not rehiring anyone who had previously been removed. However, the Commission found that the agency was required, by a prior settlement agreement, to expunge the complainant's removal from his official personnel file. Because the agency had failed to do so, and then relied upon that file in ascertaining that the complainant had been removed, the Commission found the agency had failed to articulate a legitimate reason for its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Secretary of Navy,</span> 01976131 (1998), the Commission found the agency failed to advance a legitimate reason for the complainant's performance rating where neither of the rating officials could provide the administrative judge with an explanation of the rating. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Smithson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A03598 (2000), the Commission found that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate reason for the complainant's nonselection where its only explanation was that "based on a review of his application, he was not selected." The Commission commented that a "less informative explanation for an agency's hiring decision is difficult to imagine." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When performance issues are cited as a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, the agency must provide some proof of the performance problem. In <span class="Italic">Prevo v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01972832 (2000), the agency denied the complainant a transfer to a position she desired, claiming that she had a reputation for being confrontational with supervisors. The Commission examined the complainant's performance appraisals, and found that she was given high marks for her ability to work with others. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Prevo</span> found that the agency failed to meet its burden, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are cognizant that the agency's burden to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions is not an onerous one. In the case at hand, however, the record is without any independent evidence that demonstrates complainant was less qualified for the positions in question. Moreover, the evidence that does exist in the record casts doubt on D's explanation of complainant's qualifications and "confrontational" reputation. Consequently, the Commission finds that the agency has failed to set forth, with sufficient clarity, reasons for complainant's nonselection for a position in the Tampa office such that she has been given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons are pretext<span class="Italic">. See Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990): <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997). The agency has therefore failed to provide an articulation of its reasons for not selecting complainant for a position in the Tampa office sufficient to overcome complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Amaro v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994367 (2002), the Commission found the agency failed to meet its burden of proffering a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for a lowered performance appraisal where the agency asserted that the complainant's EEO activity did not insulate him from being responsible for his performance. In finding in the complainant's favor, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Amaro</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency attempted to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the "unacceptable" performance evaluation and the letter of warning, by asserting that the fact that complainant had prior EEO activity did not shield him from being held responsible for his area of authority. The agency alleged that complainant did not present any documentation to refute the agency's legitimate non-discriminatory reasons that management offered for its action; however, the record does not reveal that the agency gave any reasons for its actions. As the agency was unable to produce the management official responsible for the "unacceptable" and the letter of warning, any explanation it provides must be viewed as an after-the-fact justification. While the agency's burden to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory explanation for its actions is not an onerous one, Commission precedent holds that the agency must set forth, with sufficient clarity, reasons for complainant's unacceptable performance and letter of warning such that he has a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons are pretext<span class="Italic">. See Parker v. United States,</span> EEOC Request No. 059001100 (April 30, 1990); <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997). In providing an after-the-fact justification for complainant's complaint based on retaliation, the agency has failed to meet its burden to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Accordingly, we find that complainant's unacceptable performance and the letter of warning was motivated by retaliation. The agency's finding of no retaliation in this matter is therefore REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as with cases involving the substantive bases of discrimination, an agency cannot sustain its burden of articulating a legitimate reason without some specific evidence of the reason. Speculation as to the reason does not sustain the agency's burden. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A43215 (2006), the complainant maintained that the agency engaged in repeated delays in processing travel orders and vouchers. The agency presented no testimony from any agency official actually involved in processing the orders and vouchers. Instead, it offered only the testimony of a union official, who was not involved in processing the orders and vouchers, who simply provided his own opinion on the delays. The Commission found that this testimony was insufficient to establish a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, where the agency officials involved in the action cannot specifically recall the reasons, the agency has not met its burden of production. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121587 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains an affidavit from M1. Therein, M1 asserts that he was one of the decision-makers with respect to the claim at issue. Regarding Complainant's medical documentation being denied, M1 states "I do not recall the specifics, but I think it had something to do with wording. He could not return to work without acceptable medical documentation.... I am not certain [why Complainant's medical documentation was refused] due to the lapse of time, but believe it was related to his doctor not stating that he was released to return to work. He had to be cleared to come back from his traumatic injury which I believe was heat exhaustion." The record also contains an affidavit from a Supervisor, Customer Services. Therein, the Supervisor asserts that he does not recall why the medical documentation was refused. Finally, the Postmaster at the time of the incident asserts, in an affidavit, that she does not recall the exact details with respect to the claim at issue. We find the Agency's explanation of the refusal of Complainant's medical documentation to be vague and not sufficient to rebut Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation. The Agency therefore failed to carry its burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for denying Complainant's medical documentation to return him to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's evidence doesn't support the proffered reasons, the agency fails to meet its burden of production. For example, in <span class="Italic">King v. Attorney General</span>, 0120111958 (2012), the Commission found the agency failed to support its proffered reason with actual evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal with respect to her termination. Complainant testified that she engaged in protected activity when she initially filed the instant EEO complaint on March 12, 2008, raising Claim 1, and both S1 and S2 acknowledged being aware of the instant complaint at that time. Complainant satisfies the second element because she was terminated. And Complainant meets the third element by showing that her termination took place one month after filing the instant claim, establishing the requisite inference of a causal link.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">McDonnell-Douglas</span>, the burden shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Complainant's termination, <span id="Page_1525"></span>which Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, was a pretext for unlawful retaliation. In this case, S2 said that Complainant was terminated because she was a problem employee and stirred things up. S2 further said that Complainant had been counseled about her work by S1. However, S1's affidavit does not support S2's articulated reasons. S1 provides no reason whatsoever for Complainant's termination, except to state that the Agency could terminate an ASO's contract for any reason. S1 does not mention that Complainant was counseled about her work performance at any point, and does not state that he considered Complainant to be a difficult employee. Further, aside from S2's assertion, there is no evidence in the record that Complainant was ever counseled by any Agency employee, whether verbally or in writing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S3 indicated that Complainant was very "vocal" regarding the need for training and to correct security functions. There is also a suggestion in the record that S2 questioned Complainant's coworkers to find out if she was circulating some sort of petition concerning a "hostile work environment." However, S3 denied that there was any "discussion among the leadership here at [the Agency] as to a performance issue or anything like that."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S4's affidavit further rebuts S2's assertion that Complainant had any work performance problems. S4 testified that he was shocked at Complainant's termination, commenting that Complainant was "one of the best hands" the Agency had.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the lack of evidence to support S2's proffered reason (the only management official who offered any reason) for Complainant's termination, and the very short time period (one month) between when Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity and the time she was terminated, we find that it is more likely than not that Agency management engaged in retaliatory discrimination when it terminated her services, as alleged in Claim 2. In doing so, the Agency violated the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII and the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record and the contentions on appeal, we AFFIRM Agency's final decision finding no discrimination regarding Claim 1, and REVERSE the Agency's final decision finding no discrimination regarding Claim 2. Accordingly, we REMAND Claim 2 to the Agency for further processing in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davina W. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120140640 (2016), the agency presented the complainant with the choice of a voluntary curtailment or an alternative option that would ultimately lead to an involuntary curtailment of her embassy post, which the complainant claimed was in reprisal for her prior EEO activity. The Commission credited the agency's explanation that the complainant had developed difficult relationships with the Ambassador and other coworkers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency stated that the decision to present Complainant with the choice of either a voluntary curtailment or a Cable of No Confidence that would lead to an involuntary curtailment was based on the untenable situation that had developed between Complainant and the Ambassador. Complainant on several occasions at a minimum suggested that the Ambassador engaged in or was contemplating engaging in conduct that was improper and/or unethical. The Ambassador was cleared of any wrongdoing or regulations would support the Ambassador's intended conduct yet Complainant would nevertheless persist in adopting an accusatory tone toward the Ambassador. The Ambassador believed she could not rely upon Complainant to be supportive. Complainant also experienced difficulties with several Embassy personnel including the DCM, the Nurse and employee who were disturbed by Complainant's plan to rebalance the workload. We find that the Agency presented legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision to seek Complainant's curtailment from the Port of Spain post.</p>
