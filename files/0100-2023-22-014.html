<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-15"><span class="space">A.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">BONA FIDE</span></span> OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification is a condition imposed by an employer that requires the person holding a certain position to be a member of a certain protected category. Such requirements are not <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> discriminatory, as the term "<span class="Italic">bona fide</span>" would indicate. Such requirements are, however, inherently suspect and the Commission interprets the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement exception to Title VII narrowly. In accordance with 29 CFR 1604.2(a):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;The Commission will find that the following situations do not warrant the application of the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification exception:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;The refusal to hire a woman because of her sex based on the assumptions of the comparative employment characteristics of women in general. For example, the assumption that the turnover rate among women is higher than among men.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(ii)&#x2003;The refusal to hire an individual based on stereotyped characteristics of the sexes. Such stereotypes include, for example, that men are less capable of assembling intricate equipment; that women are less capable of aggressive salesmanship. The principle of nondiscrimination requires that individuals be considered on the basis of individual capacities and not on the basis of any characteristics generally attributed to the group.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(iii)&#x2003;The refusal to hire an individual because of the preferences of coworkers, the employer, clients or customers, except as covered specifically in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Where it is necessary for the purpose of authenticity or genuineness, the Commission will consider sex to be a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, an actor or actress.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the regulations with respect to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualifications apply equally to males and females. The impetus for the Title VII legislation may have been discrimination against minority groups, but its sweep and intent was to eliminate the distinctions based on status and not to advantage a particular category of employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The exceptions that allow an agency to use sex as a job requirement are narrow. The federal government does not, for example, employ many actors or actresses. An agency that wishes to establish sex as an occupational requirement will have to bear a heavy burden.</p>
<p class="noindent">In practice, the Commission has narrowly construed sex as a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification. In <span class="Italic">Doviak v. Department of Navy</span>, 01860381 (1986), the agency refused to allow a female mechanical engineering technician to embark on sea trials for a reconditioned submarine. The agency argued that the employee's previous participation in sea trials had lessened the privacy of male military personnel and could have an adverse impact on the crew's readiness. The Navy maintained that being male was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification for taking part in sea trials. The Commission firmly rejected the agency's arguments, finding that the agency had not shown "that its BFOQ policy was reasonably necessary to the normal operation of business <span class="Italic">and</span> that its sex-based requirement had a manifest relationship to the employment in question." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission found that in order to sustain the use of sex as a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification, the agency must demonstrate that "the <span class="Italic">essence</span> of the business operation would be undermined by not hiring members of one sex exclusively." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Navy presented no evidence that appellant's presence on a previous sea trial had served to undermine the crew's alertness. The EEOC found that the agency could only prevail with a showing that it could not reasonably accommodate "the appellant in a way to minimize the clash of privacy interests of the male crew and the nondiscriminatory principle of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the Commission contrasted the case with the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321 (1977), where the policy of hiring only male guards at a maximum security prison was upheld. The EEOC noted that the Court's determination was based on the "uniquely dangerous conditions" in a maximum security prison and the presence of a large number of sex offenders. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There was no evidence that such a threatening atmosphere existed aboard the submarine.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, as the Commission has noted, several courts rejected sex as a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement when based solely on the privacy interests of the inmates. The Commission summarized the findings of several courts in <span class="Italic">Gonzales-Withers v. Attorney General</span>, 05910550 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[C]ourts have held that prisons can preserve the privacy rights of their inmates without sacrificing the right of correctional officers to equal employment opportunities, thus, the BFOQ defense has been rejected. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hardin v. Stynchcomb</span>, 691 F.2d 1364 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Forts v. Ward</span>, 621 F.2d 1210 (2d Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Gunther v. Iowa State Men's Reformatory</span>, 612 F.2d 1079 (8th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 466 U.S. 966 (1980). Where prisons have claimed sex was a BFOQ because the duties of correctional officers included performing strip searches and observing inmates while the inmates were using the showers and toilets, courts have ordinarily rejected this justification as inadequate and found that the prisons had not met their burden of showing that alternatives with a less discriminatory impact were not available. <span class="Italic">Hardin</span>, 691 F.2d at 1373; <span class="Italic">Gunther</span>, 612 F.2d at 1087; <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Corrections</span>, 615 F. Supp. 804 (M.D. Ala. 1985). A prison could, for example, reassign duties involving strip searches and shower/toilet surveillance so that, except in emergencies, these duties could be performed by guards of the same sex as the inmates. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">But sex has been held to be a BFOQ with respect to psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Pratt v. Attorney General</span>, 01972502 (2000), alleged discrimination based on the agency's policy of not allowing female Detention Enforcement Officers (DEOs) to escort male detainees. The agency's policy in this case stated in pertinent part, "[a]n alien should never be escorted by an officer of the opposite sex," which the Commission found to be facially discriminatory. In its review of the complaint, the Commission kept in mind the agency's stated concerns, specifically, the safety and security of the female DEOs, the detainees' dignity, and cultural sensitivity, as well as the agency's mission to detain, process and assist in deporting aliens. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the agency's concerns regarding the safety of the female DEOs, we find, as did the AJ, a lack of evidence as to why female DEOs were not as capable of providing for their own safety as the men were. We also note our agreement with the AJ's determination that the cultural preferences of the male detainees is akin to "customer preference," which is not a BFOQ<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.2(a). As such, we find the agency failed to satisfy its burden of establishing that an all-female conveyance detail would undermine the business of the Florence facility such that sex based assignment schedule was justified pursuant to a BFOQ based on safety and/or "cultural sensitivity" of the alien.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_976"></span>With respect to the agency's concerns over the privacy implications of allowing DEOs to escort detainees of the opposite sex, we have previously assumed, without deciding, that sex was not a BFOQ with respect to prisoner's privacy concerns<span class="Italic">. See Gonzales-Withers v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910550 at n.6 (September 19, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> found significant two factors: (1) the agency failed in the past to abide by its policy of not allowing DEOs to escort detainees of the opposite sex; and (2) there was evidence that there were less discriminatory alternatives available. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> found that these two factors undermined the agency's BFOQ defense:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the primary essence of the function at issue is to transport aliens back to their native country in a safe and dignified, yet firm, manner. <span class="Italic">See</span>, Detention Officer Handbook, ROI at ex. 21. Although the record reveals that concerns regarding bathroom usage and "pat downs" led to the same sex policy, we find the agency failed to carry its burden of establishing there are no other less discriminatory alternatives available to avoid detainees privacy concerns during escort assignments, and thus the agency's BFOQ defense fails. The agency's own concessions with respect to the Florence facility's failure to abide by its own same sex policy is evidence that such accommodations are available to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, in making its limited finding of discrimination, the agency's final decision questioned why the facility allowed a mixed group of detainees with all male DEOs, whereas all female DEOs were not permitted. Specifically, the FAD quoted testimony of the supervisor who explained that allowing all male DEOs for a mixed group of detainees did not create problems with respect to the need for a "pat down" because the female returnees have "already been searched [at the start of the trip] and do not have to be re-searched." ROI at ex. 10. The FAD continued by saying," [b]ut, presumably, the same practice could be followed with respect to the men." FAD at p. 16. The agency's concessions with respect to its ability to conduct "pat down" searches of detainees prior to boarding the bus before returning to Mexico is indicative of the fact that there are reasonable alternatives to the same sex policy for escorts. According to the agency, two female escorts could escort an all male or mixed group of detainees if "pat downs" were conducted before the assignment began. The record contains insufficient evidence as to whether, in other escort detail assignments, such a practice could not be followed. Curiously, complainant testified that she has been trained to conduct body searches on males, and males were likewise taught to conduct body searches on females. Furthermore, complainant alluded to the fact that the prohibition against same sex "pat down" searches is not common to all Service Processing Centers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also admits that when escorting a male detainee to the restroom, a female DEO is, "as capable of sitting outside of the restroom as a male" DEO presumably does when it escorts a mixed groups of detainees. FAD at p. 16. Both the OIC and the Acting Chief testified as to their concerns regarding restroom use of detainees while on longer details involving transportation by airplane. They explained it may be preferable for the detainee to use the restroom at the airport before boarding the plane, and thus the escort would need to accompany the detainee into the restroom. However, complainant testified that she has escorted a male detainee to the restroom on planes and waited outside before. Furthermore, as complainant points out, the policy provides for such. We therefore find, as did the AJ, that the agency's disregard for its own same sex policy undermines its BFOQ defense, and therefore the policy, as facially discriminatory, must fail.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission denied a request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Pratt v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520070398 (2007). The agency also sought clarification of a footnote in the original decision, requesting the Commission to rule on several specific situations. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span>, declined to rule on the specific situations without an investigation and hearing on each, but did offer some additional guidance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For illustrative purposes only (we make no definitive findings regarding these scenarios), we shall restate and discuss two of the scenarios raised by the agency on appeal for clarification:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The escort detail will transit through a third country where the known "secured" holding facility is a general population cell with open lavatory facilities, and the local rules mandate that the escorts remain to watch the aliens in the cell, including their use of the lavatory, otherwise the alien cannot be housed at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The alien has been a victim of a crime by a member of the opposite sex such as rape.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding scenario 1, one issue the agency should examine is whether the only way to reasonably deport the alien detainee is through a third country with the lavatory rule and situation described by the agency. If yes, then the next question would be the likelihood of the alien having to using the lavatory during the time in question. It is not clear from the scenario if the period of time in the third country would be minutes, hours, or possibly overnight. Finally, the next question for the agency is whether the escorts' observation of the detainee's "use of the lavatory" actually requires literally observing the detainee naked. These are the issues the agency should examine in these situations. If the agency reasonably concludes that such privacy interests of the detainee will likely be compromised because there is no reasonable alternative to protect the detainee's privacy interest, then this is the type of instance where the requirement of a same-sex assignment of a DEO could possibly be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding scenario 2, we find that the agency has not explained in this scenario why the escort detail must be the same sex as the detainee. In order to justify sex as a BFOQ, such an explanation would be required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These two scenarios were chosen to show the type of analysis the agency should undertake when it is deciding whether a requirement for a same-sex assignment of a DEO could possibly be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Booker v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/07a30076.txt">07A30076</a> (2005), the Commission rejected the agency's attempt to distinguish a policy that required female detainees to be escorted by female agents from the situation in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span>. Finding that such a policy was facially discriminatory, and that the agency had not established sex was a <span class="Italic">bone fide</span> occupational requirement, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Booker</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's policy is facially discriminatory because it classifies on the basis of sex by requiring sex to be used as the determinant factor in designating who transports female detainees. Section 703(e) of Title VII only permits classifications based on sex '"where...sex...is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.'" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e)(l) <span class="Italic">(quoted in Dothard, et al. v. Rawlinson,</span> 433 U.S. 321, 333 (1977)). Where there is direct evidence of discrimination, the burden is on the agency to show that the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification (BFOQ) was reasonably necessary to the normal operation of business. The BFOQ exception "was meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex." <span class="Italic">Dothard,</span> 433 U.S. at 334.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur with the AJ's finding that the agency had an informal policy or practice, that was discriminatory on its face, to assign female officers to escort female detainees based exclusively on the officers' sex. As articulated by the AJ, in order to escape liability, the agency must show that sex was a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal operation of business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ looks to <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> for guidance in the instant case. EEOC Appeal No. 01972502. Notably, the agency found to have discriminated on the basis of sex in <span class="Italic">Pratt,</span> is the same agency alleged to have discriminated against complainant. The agency argues that <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> is distinguishable from this case because here, complainant was merely directed to perform her job duties and was compensated for the overtime that she worked, whereas the complainant in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> was deprived of assignments that the male officers received. To the contrary, the Commission finds that <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> is analogous to the instant case and that the AJ's reliance on <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> is well-founded. While the complainant in <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> was denied the opportunity to escort male detainees solely because she was female, the complainant in the instant case was ordered to escort female detainees solely because she is female. Although the Commission notes that escorting detainees was a duty of complainant in her position as an IEO, this does not permit the agency to violate Title VII by assigning the duties based on sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency does not argue that sex is a BFOQ, either in its final order or in its brief on appeal. Nevertheless, as the BFOQ exception to direct evidence of discrimination was addressed at the hearing, and discussed in the AJ's decision extensively, we will address it briefly. Complainant's main work objective as an IEO was to ensure that local businesses comply with the relevant sections of the Immigration Naturalization and Reform Act. In order to accomplish the mandate of her position, complainant contacted local businesses, obtained copies of relevant documents, served warrants, questioned witnesses and participated in "operations" which frequently resulted in arrests. Among her duties was to transport detainees. Following the hearing, the AJ found that the agency had not proffered a sufficient argument that sex was a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. Testimony indicated that in addition to sex, the fact that complainant was the only female officer with a weapon factored into her selection. The AJ found, however, that there was "no evidence from which it could be reasonably concluded that the essence of the business operation would be undermined by not having armed female officers present during the escort or transportation of female detainees." Thus, there was no evidence that the essence of the business operation would be undermined by the use of armed male officers to transport the female detainee to her residence. Regarding the OIC's contention that he preferred female officers to be present during the escort or transportation of female detainees, we note that his "preference" for using female escorts stemmed not from a concern regarding the safety of the female detainees, but in order to prevent male officers from being accused of misconduct. We find that this explanation fails to satisfy the agency's burden of establishing that an all-male escort of a female <span id="Page_977"></span>detainee would undermine the business of the Santa Ana office such that the sex-based assignment of escorts was justified. The agency has not met its burden of showing that alternatives with less discriminatory impact were not available. We find that the official policy regarding radio contact is a reasonable alternative to the "female required" policy when a female detainee needs transport. The fact that the agency implements the use of radios for male officers to maintain contact while in transport when female officers are unavailable, undermines the agency's argument that there was no less discriminatory alternative available. Therefore, we concur with the AJ's finding that the agency's informal policy or practice of requiring available female officers to escort female detainees, to the exclusion of available male officers, is a facially discriminatory policy for which the agency failed to establish that sex is a BFOQ.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has been rigorous in its scrutiny of cases where sex is purported to be a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement. In <span class="Italic">Perry v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A31005 (2005), the Commission reversed the issuance of summary judgment in favor of the agency and remanded the case to hearing finding there was a genuine factual dispute as to whether sex was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement at an INS detention facility for females. Relying on both <span class="Italic">Pratt</span> and <span class="Italic">Booker</span>, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Perry</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that conditions at TGK differ greatly from those at Krome. First, she says that her assignments at TGK lasted longer than at Krome. She also states that TGK assignments required her to do work below her grade (at the GS-5 and GS-7 levels), and that these lower-level assignments would have a negative effect on future employment opportunities. Complainant claims that conditions at the TGK office are cramped, unhealthy, and unsafe. She also asserts that at times she was required to work alone at TGK and that this increased the chance of being falsely accused of inappropriate behavior. Further, complainant contends that concerns for TGK detainees' safety and privacy can be addressed without resorting to a female-only staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency acknowledges that complainant was involuntarily assigned to TGK because of her sex, but maintains that being female is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification (BFOQ) for working at TGK. The agency cites privacy concerns for the female detainees and the sexual abuse problem at Krome. It also cites the prohibitive logistics of adhering to safety and privacy regulations if male DOs were assigned to TGK.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge (AJ) issued a decision without a hearing. According to the AJ, in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under Title VII, the complainant must establish that she was subjected to an adverse employment action which rendered her aggrieved. He concluded that although the conditions at TGK may have inconvenienced complainant, they did not cause her any materially significant disadvantages. Therefore, the AJ stated, these assignments did not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. He further held that even though complainant was assigned to TGK and male DOs were not, it would "defy logic" to conclude that this in itself rendered her aggrieved, in light of the fact that the assignments themselves were not adverse. In sum, the AJ reasoned that because complainant did not suffer an adverse employment action she was therefore not aggrieved, and because she was not aggrieved, she did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency had a facially discriminatory policy, that complainant was aggrieved, and that the AJ was in error to grant a decision without a holding a hearing on the BFOQ question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was aggrieved by the involuntary assignments to TGK. The harm to complainant arises by the existence of the facially discriminatory policy, and the fact that complainant was affected by the facially discriminatory policy when she was ordered to work at TGK solely because she was female. By treating complainant differently in the duties to which she was assigned, based on her sex, complainant has been rendered aggrieved, and she has shown that this policy caused a harm to a term, condition, or privilege of her employment for which there is a remedy. Additionally, the Commission has specifically held that an involuntary work assignment constitutes an injury to a term, condition, or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">Lee v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A51786 (March 30, 2005);<span class="Italic"> Alexander v. National Archives and Records Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965585 (October 10, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the AJ erroneously conflated the questions of whether complainant was aggrieved and whether she established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Whether a complainant is aggrieved relates to whether complainant states a claim. Whether the complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, however, turns on "whether the employer is treating some people less favorably than others based on their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324 at 335 (1977). A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination arises because an employer's acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.<span class="Italic"> Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, et al.</span>, 438 U.S. 567 at 577 (1978). However, a complainant need not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case when she has presented direct evidence of discrimination. Therefore, the AJ's foray into a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> analysis was also in error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also erred in deciding that there was no genuine issue of material fact. The Commission's regulations allow an AJ to issue a decision without a hearing when he or she finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). This regulation is patterned after the summary judgment procedure set forth in Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. U.S. Supreme Court has held that summary judgment is appropriate where a court determines that, given the substantive legal and evidentiary standards that apply to the case, there exists no genuine issue of material fact. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.</span>, 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment a court's function is not to weigh the evidence but rather to determine whether there are genuine issues for trial.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 249. The evidence of the non-moving party must be believed at the summary judgment stage and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in the non-moving party's favor.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 255. An issue of fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find in favor of the non-moving party. <span class="Italic">Celotex v. Catrett</span>, All U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). A fact is "material" if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. In the context of an administrative proceeding, if a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, a decision without a hearing is not appropriate.<span class="Italic"> See Petty v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A24206 (July 11, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question of whether sex is a BFOQ is a genuine issue of material fact which warrants a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Radman v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A02824 (May 21, 2002). As stated above, the agency's policy is facially discriminatory because it classifies on the basis of sex by requiring sex to be used as the determinant factor in designating who works at TGK. Section 703(e) of Title VII only permits classifications based on sex "'where...sex...is a<span class="Italic"> bona fide</span> occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.'" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e)(l) (quoted in <span class="Italic">Dothard, et al. v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 333 (1977)). Where an agency's policy is facially discriminatory, the burden is on the agency to show that the BFOQ was reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business. The BFOQ exception "was meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex." <span class="Italic">Dothard</span>, 433 U.S. at 334.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the genuine issue of material fact is whether being female is a BFOQ for working at TGK. The agency's practice of sending only female DOs to TGK based exclusively on the DOs' sex, was discriminatory on its face. As articulated above, in order to avoid liability, the agency must show that sex was a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency and complainant present differing views on this question. According to the agency, a female-only DO staff is required not only because of past sexual misconduct by male employees, but also in order to protect the detainees' privacy and safety. In support of its policy, the agency points out that two male Krome employees were convicted of sexual assault on detainees, that TGK has open shower and toilet facilities, and that its female-only staff policy at TGK complies with the Florida Model Jail Standards. Finally, the agency asserts that there are no viable nondiscriminatory options for maintaining a safe and private facility for detainees. Complainant, on the other hand, asserts that a female-only DO staff will not necessarily alleviate privacy and safety concerns, noting that females are just as capable of sexual misconduct as males, and that male maintenance employees already regularly enter the facility, thus undermining the female-only policy. She also contends that alternative, nondiscriminatory options exist for ensuring safety and privacy at the TGK facility and that the essence of DOs' work would not be undermined by assigning male and female staff to TGK.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission directs the parties to its recent decision in<span class="Italic"> Booker v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC No. 07A30076 (July 13, 2005). <span class="Italic">Booker</span> involved a female INS employee who, because she was female, was involuntarily assigned to escort a female detainee to her residence. The AJ concluded the practice of requiring female escorts female detainees was facially discriminatory and that the agency did not have an adequate BFOQ defense. The Commission upheld these findings on appeal. The Commission based its analysis on whether being female was a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise, and examined whether the use of male officers to transport the female detainees would undermine the essence of the operation. Likewise, in the present case, it is necessary to determine whether being female is a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal operation of TGK and whether male DOs would undermine the essence of the operation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Pratt v. Department of Justice</span> is also instructive. EEOC Appeal No. 01972502 (August 18, 2000). In <span class="Italic">Pratt</span>, the agency did not allow female INS Detention Enforcement Officers to accompany one another on escort details involving male detainees. The <span id="Page_978"></span>agency based its policy on safety, security, and privacy concerns, as well as detainees' cultural sensitivities. On appeal, the Commission analyzed the safety and security question by looking at whether there was a factual basis for the agency's conclusion that female employees were less capable of providing for their safety. The Commission's analysis of the privacy question turned on whether privacy was essential to the normal operation of business or whether it was a secondary matter, and also whether the privacy concerns could be addressed without undermining employees' equal employment opportunities. Similarly, the facts of the present case must be examined in order to determine whether detainee safety and privacy are essential concerns of the agency and whether these concerns can be addressed in a nondiscriminatory manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having raised arguments contradicting the agency's explanation for using sex as a BFOQ, the proper venue for addressing the BFOQ question is at a hearing. In light of the above analysis, the proper questions to be addressed in a hearing are: whether a female-only DO staff is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of TGK, whether protecting detainees' privacy and safety concerns is an fundamental or secondary function of TGK, and whether options exist that would protect both the detainees' safety and privacy and employees' equal employment opportunity rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Mirzayans v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120040649.txt">0120040649</a> (2007), the Commission upheld sex--based assignments for customs inspectors at Los Angeles airport, who were required to search incoming passengers suspected of concealing merchandise or contraband. The Commission also found that the female inspectors were not denied assignments on the basis of sex because of the policy. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mirzayans, found:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a determination of whether the agency's policy of making certain job assignments based on the employees' gender was unlawful. Section 703(e) of Title VII permits classifications based on sex "where...sex...is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(e)(l). In this instance, the AJ found that the agency had established that a core responsibility of customs inspectors was to perform personal searches of passengers passing through the airport to locate concealed merchandise or contraband. The passengers' privacy interests "in avoiding intrusive physical searches by opposite-sex inspectors" justified the sex-based assignments "as the privacy concerns involved the essence of the Agency's business." We agree with the AJ' s finding in this respect. As one court noted: "we cannot conceive of a more basic subject of privacy than the naked body. The desire to shield one's unclothed figure from view of strangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity." <span class="Italic">Local 567 American Fed'n. of State, County, and Mun. Employees v. Michigan Council</span> 25, 635 F. Supp. 1010, 1013 (E.D. Mich. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question remains as to whether it was necessary for the agency to assign two male and two female customs inspectors to every passenger processing team in order to effectuate the protection of the passengers' privacy interests, or whether reasonable alternatives existed. Complainant proffered the argument that the working group convened in May 1998 came up with 5 alternatives which would have furthered the agency's interests in protecting passenger privacy while allowing female customs inspectors to serve on assignments other than primarily passenger processing. Evidence was introduced at hearing which showed that when customs inspectors bid on their assignments under the agency/union collective bargaining agreement, bids of female inspectors could be denied, even with the requisite seniority, in order to maintain the needed number of female customs inspectors in passenger processing assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the testimony of the witnesses at hearing, the AJ specifically found that the alternatives suggested by the working group were not reasonable alternatives to the staffing policy. We see no reason to disturb this finding as it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. We note that the fact that the agency modified the policy in October 2001 does not necessarily lead one to conclude that at the time of the complaints filed by complainant, that modification would also have been reasonable. Changed circumstances in travel, security policy and even personnel staffing levels all affect the reasonableness of the implementation of the alternatives.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dewey R. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120142308 (2016), similarly found a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification where the agency selected a female employee over the complainant, a male, for a Correctional Systems Officer position at the Danbury correctional facility. A core duty of the position was to conduct daily visual strip searches of female inmates entering or departing the institution. The agency argued that to fill the position with a male employee would cause an undue burden on operations since only female officers could conduct searches of female inmates. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dewey R</span>., concluded that having staff of the same sex was essential to the agency's mission and that there was no less restrictive alternative to accomplishing strip searches while maintaining female inmate privacy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Commission finds that the AJ properly issued summary judgment as the material facts are undisputed. Section 703(e) of Title VII only permits classifications based on sex where...sex...is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. The Agency's Receiving and Discharge Manual, PS 5800.12, provides that a visual search, i.e., strip search, shall be routinely performed by officers of the same sex as the inmate. On August 12, 2012, the Agency issued PS 5324.09, which established a Sexually Abusive Behavior Prevention and Intervention Program which provides in part that an Agency facility shall not conduct cross-gender strip searches or cross-gender visual cavity searches...except in exigent circumstances or when performed by medical practitioners.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this instance, the AJ found that the Agency established that a core function of the work done in the Receiving &#x0026; Discharge department involved strip searches of female inmates. The Agency presented evidence that there were previously three female Correctional Systems Officers in the department but that one of the women transferred, thus leading to the selection at issue. The Agency established that filling this vacant position with a female Correctional Systems Officer was paramount given that strip searches occurred whenever inmates departed or returned to the prison and also when new prisoners arrived. The Agency explained that it would have been in a precarious position had it not hired a female candidate. The Agency pointed out that in a circumstance of only two female Correctional Systems Officers, it would be left additionally shorthanded when one of the two female Correctional Systems Officers would be on scheduled or unscheduled leave, or attending training. The Agency noted that other departments at the institution had been adversely impacted when it was necessary to borrow their female Correctional Officers to conduct strip searches. The AJ found that the Agency's selection of a female candidate was the least restrictive method in order to protect female inmates' privacy rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ that sex was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification for the position at issue. The situation at this particular prison necessitated the hiring of a female for the Correctional Systems Officer position. There were a sufficient number of strip searches conducted to establish that this job duty was a core responsibility of the position, and could not be delegated to other female employees. Previously, the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Mirzayan v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120040649 (January 23, 2007), that a policy that resulted in female Customs Inspectors performing overtime and otherwise adjusting their schedules to allow female inspectors to pat down female passengers is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification. Similarly, the privacy interests at stake here for female inmates required that a sufficient number of female Correctional Systems Officers be available to conduct strip searches. Therefore, we find that the Agency did not engage in discrimination based on sex when it considered sex as a factor in its selection decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lyons v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120080929 (2008), the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment where the complainant claimed that sex was not a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement for the scheduling of TSA screeners. The complainant, a female, claimed that she had less desirable days off than male counterparts with less seniority. The agency claimed that it needed to schedule screeners by sex in order to have a sufficient number of same-sex screeners available on each shift for personal searches. In finding that there was a genuine issue of fact that precluded summary judgment, the Commission also found the agency could only prevail on a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement defense if the personal searching of passengers was a "core" duty for the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a review of the record, the Commission concludes that the AJ erred in issuing a decision without a hearing in this case because genuine issues of material fact exist. Specifically, the parties dispute complainant's job title and duties. The record contains a job offer letter to complainant, referring to the position as "Baggage Transportation Security Screener (TSS)." The agency, however, refers to the "Screener position" and the AJ decision states that complainant was a "Transportation Security Screener." The differences in title reflect differing opinions as to the duties and responsibilities of complainant's position. The agency contends that at times complainant may need to screen passengers and, therefore, the consideration of sex in the bidding process falls under the BFOQ exception. Complainant, however, argues that she does not screen passengers and is not trained or authorized to do so. Further, the parties conflict on whether or not a baggage screener can serve as a witness during a passenger screening, if the baggage screener is not certified or trained in passenger screening. The record is also unclear as to whether or not "filling-in" for passenger screeners is one of complainant's primary duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The BFOQ exception may be applicable with respect to positions where the screening of passengers is a core duty, to protect the privacy rights of the passengers. However, the use of sex as a factor in the scheduling of positions that do not perform the wanding and pat-down of individuals may be discriminatory. Consequently, the record needs to be further developed to resolve the conflicts presented by complainant and the agency.</p>

Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120142146 (2016) (TSA's refusal to accept female employee's bid for a baggage inspection shift was based on her sex, but asserted a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational defense by establishing that it needed to have certified female officers available to do pat-downs).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stephany A. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120151021 (2018), upheld a decision without a hearing in favor of the agency where the agency argued that the defense exception excused its consideration of sex in assigning shifts to a Customs and Border Protection Officer. The pertinent facts in <span class="Italic">Stephany A</span>. were:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After Complainant qualified with her weapon, she was informed by a Supervisory CBPO (S1) that she would be assigned to the 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> night shift effective April 7, 2013. Complainant alleged that S1 told her that her shift was changing because she was a female. The Section Chief for Passenger Operations at SFO (S2) stated that a minimum number of females and males are needed on each shift for same-sex duties that occur during passenger processing, such as personal searches, transit lounge duty, transportation of female detainees, restroom escorts, and witnessing medical examinations. According to S2, the Agency Personal Search Handbook CIS HB 3300-04B mandates the presence of a female CBPO for conducting personal searches, including pat downs, of a female passenger and for witnessing a medical examination of a female passenger.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to S2, CBPOs submit bids for work units during the BRP process. S2 stated that a committee of Agency managers and union representatives place the CBPOs in the work units based on seniority and qualifications for each work unit. S2 averred that CBPOs who are not placed in their requested work unit default to the Passenger Core Process, which includes Passport Control and Baggage Control. S2 stated that CBPOs assigned to the Passenger Core Process can then submit their preference for shifts. According to S2, there were 40 females assigned to Passenger Operations, 11 of whom were assigned to biddable work units, 12 of whom were assigned to specialized units, and two of whom were trainees. S2 stated that the remaining 15 female CBPOs form the Passenger Core Process pool that is used to staff the night shifts at SFO, as well as Oakland and San Jose International Airports.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that she oversees the Overtime and Scheduling Desk at SFO. According to S1, on March 14, 2013, Complainant qualified with her weapon and was assigned to the 7:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> day shift. S1 averred that a female CBPO (C1) vacated a 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> night shift slot because of a hardship and was replaced by Complainant effective April 7, 2013. S1 asserted that Complainant had the least seniority in her pool. He further stated that shift preference is determined by seniority, shift slots available and service needs. S2 averred that in spring 2013, management had discussions with the union to brainstorm possible alternatives to assigning a certain number of females to the night shift, but no alternative was agreed upon.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stephany A</span>. considered the "core duties" of complainant's job and whether the "essence of the business would be undermined" in upholding the decision without a hearing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant alleges that the Agency subjected her to sex discrimination when it treated her differently than other CBPOs because she is female. In this case, the Agency acknowledges that its policy included a sex-based criterion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 703(e) of Title VII permits classifications based on sex "where...sex...is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2e(1). This Title VII private sector provision also applies to the federal sector.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the existence of an explicit sex-based assignment policy is discriminatory on its face, the Agency may only avoid a liability finding if the record establishes the BFOQ affirmative defense. A finding of discrimination would be appropriate if the employer failed to show that its sex-based restrictions were required as a business necessity and that there was no reasonable alternative with a less discriminatory impact. <span class="Italic">See Teamsters Local Union 117 v. Washington Dep't of Corrections</span>, 789 F.3d 979, 994 (9th Cir. 2015) ("Having male officers conduct pat searches...is undesirable and harmful to prisoner privacy and security").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as stated at 29 C.F.R. 1604.2, "the Commission believes that the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification exception as to sex should be interpreted narrowly." The law bars the refusal to hire an individual because of the preferences of the employer or customers except where it is necessary for the purpose of authenticity or genuineness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency's mission involves national security and the operation of an international airport's port of entry. The essence of the employer's business is processing passengers and baggage for national security purposes. Performing the task of screening same-sex passengers is essential to the employer's business and public safety. The Agency defends its actions, in part, by pointing out its mission and the necessity of Complainant's core duties as a CBPO. The stated reason for assigning Complainant to the night shift was the need to have an adequate supply of certified female CBPOs available to do same-sex pat-downs. It was undisputed that pat-downs are necessary for security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record appears to be undisputed with regard to the fact that the essence of the business would be undermined if the employer did not schedule a sufficient number of male and female CBPOs for each shift. Because of the sensitive nature of the pat-downs, the Agency must schedule sufficient members of a certain sex for each shift. The main dispute at issue, if any, is whether there was any cost-efficient reasonable alternative. Neither party has offered evidence of a viable alternative. Moreover, the Agency presented evidence that it had explored an alternative with the union without success. Further, there is no evidence that the job in question could be, or had been, successfully performed by members of the excluded sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that the record supports a finding that the Agency's reassignment of Complainant from her bid was sex-based. However, its actions in providing for an adequate number of female CBPOs for screening were justified under the BFOQ standard. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Agency's final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where health technicians were required to observe patients admitted to the hospital's chemical addiction programs give a urine sample, sex was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification and it was not discrimination where male technicians were required to perform more urine tests than female technicians. In <span class="Italic">Gray and Johnson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720050093, 0720050092 (2007), the agency adopted a policy that all urine screenings of patients had to be conducted by a health technician of the same sex. The policy was adopted after a complaint by a female technician about the behavior of a male patient during screening and following a workgroup report on policies and procedures for collecting urine samples. Although the population of the hospital was predominantly male, there were also more female than male technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal, the Commission reversed the finding of its administrative judge that sex was not a <span class="Italic">BFOQ</span> for urine sampling. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gray and Johnson</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find support for the AJ's conclusion that the agency did not attempt to address the privacy rights of the clients and the therapeutic goals of the Domiciliary when creating the policy. The Workgroup's Charter states that the main problem to address was that the prior urine screening policy "promot[ed] a violation of patient confidentiality/personal privacy." (Agency Motion for Summary Judgment, Exhibit 9). Examples of this included instances where patients reported feeling uncomfortable giving urine specimens in front of HTs of the opposite sex. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Furthermore, the Workgroup's recommendation in its Final Report, states that the policy was meant to "[s]afeguard patient rights and staff safety when conducting USC."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot sustain the AJ's finding that a BFOQ exception cannot be supported here because the Workgroup was created in response to a sexual harassment claim. Clearly, the agency established that it had a factual basis for believing its concurrent interest of protecting the privacy rights of its clients required a gender specific urine screening policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, with respect to the AJ's finding that no studies were presented showing that same sex urine screening testing has a beneficial therapeutic effect, there is no legal requirement that the employer produce such studies in order to justify a BFOQ. <span class="Italic">See Jennings v. New York State Office of Mental Health,</span> 786 F. Supp. 376, at 385.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find no dispute of fact that the agency satisfied its burden of establishing that sex was a BFOQ of the urine screening collection function of the HT position. The same sex urine screening collection policy was required in order to ensure the privacy rights of the individual client, and to ensure the validity of the testing for which there was a therapeutic purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Healey v. Southwood Psychiatric Hosp.</span>, 78 F.3d 128 (3rd Cir. 1996), the court approved the use of gender to make shift assignments where the hospital program provided treatment for sexually abused adolescents. The hospital argued that it was important to have at least one member of each sex on duty at all times because of both treatment and privacy concerns. In addition to upholding the use of gender, the court clarified the analysis to be applied to BFOQ cases. The court found that an adverse impact analysis was inappropriate because the policy being challenged was not facially neutral. Likewise, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis was inappropriate. As the court in <span class="Italic">Healey</span>, 78 F.3d at 131-37, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In bringing a Title VII sex-discrimination claim, two different theories of liability are available to the plaintiff: disparate treatment and disparate impact. The disparate treatment theory can be further subdivided into two subtheories: facial discrimination and pretextual discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Reidt v. County of Trempealeau</span>, 975 F.2d 1336, 1341 (7th Cir. 1992) (distinguishing between a facially discriminatory employment policy and a "pretextual" disparate treatment case); <span class="Italic">In re Pan American World Airways, Inc.</span>, 905 F.2d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">see generally</span>, RODNEY A. SMOLLA, FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS ACTS, &#x00A7; 9.03 (3d ed. 1995). A different <span id="Page_980"></span>affirmative defense may be offered to counter each of these theories of liability. In a disparate treatment case, the defendant's affirmative defense is that its policy, practice, or action is based on a "<span class="Italic">Bona-Fide</span> Occupational Qualification," ("BFOQ"). In a disparate impact case, on the other hand, the appropriate defense is that of business necessity<span class="Italic">. See International Union, United Auto., Aerospace &#x0026; Agric. Implement Workers, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc.</span>, 499 U.S. 187, 198-200, 111 S. Ct. 1196, 1203-04, 113 L. Ed.2d 158 (1991) (noting different applications of BFOQ and business necessity defenses and holding that BFOQ defense, not the business necessity defense, is appropriate standard for disparate treatment cases);<span class="Italic"> see also Grant v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 908 F.2d 1303, 1307 (6th Cir. 1990) ("overt discrimination and the statutorily-defined BFOQ defense must be analytically distinguished from <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>-type disparate impact and the accompanying judicially-created business necessity defense").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court did not address Healey's disparate impact claim in dismissing her complaint. Healey argues both disparate treatment and disparate impact theories are applicable to her case. We disagree that disparate impact is applicable. Southwood uses sex as an explicit factor in assigning its staff to the various shifts, and Healey was assigned to the night shift because of her sex. Under a disparate impact theory, liability is established when a facially neutral policy affects members of a protected class in a significantly discriminatory manner<span class="Italic">. Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 2726-27, 53 L. Ed.2d 786 (1977). Here, Southwood's staffing policy is facially discriminatory, rather than facially neutral. Analysis under disparate impact is not appropriate where plaintiff claims injury based on a facially discriminatory policy. <span class="Italic">Reidt v. County of Trempealeau</span>, 975 F.2d 1336, 1340 (7th Cir. 1992). Therefore, since this case involves a facially discriminatory employment policy, not a facially neutral one, disparate impact is not appropriate to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On Healey's disparate treatment claim, the district court applied the shifting burdens of proof under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), and concluded that Healey had failed to establish that Southwood's BFOQ defense was pretextual. However, Southwood's gender-based policy is not a pretext for discrimination--it is <span class="Italic">per se</span> intentional discrimination. This type of disparate treatment case should be distinguished from the more typical disparate treatment case, pretextual discrimination, where the familiar procedure set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is appropriate. The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> test is inapt in this case which involves a facially discriminatory policy. <span class="Italic">See Reidt v. County of Trempealeau</span>, 975 F.2d 1336, 1341 (7th Cir. 1992) (noting distinction between "facial" disparate treatment cases and "pretextual" disparate treatment cases); <span class="Italic">In re Pan American World Airways, Inc.</span>, 905 F.2d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir. 1990) (same); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Omaha Girls Club, Inc.</span>, 834 F.2d 697, 704 n.18 (8th Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">per se</span> intentional discrimination eliminates the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> burden-shifting procedure).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without using the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> shifting burdens of proof, Healey may still establish sex discrimination under Title VII. In fact, Healey has shown sex discrimination by establishing the existence of a facially discriminatory employment policy. Title VII expressly states that "[it] shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer...to discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's...sex[.]" 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000(e). Thus, Title VII sets forth a sweeping prohibition against overt gender-based discrimination in the workplace. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., City of Los Angeles Dep't of Water and Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 98 S. Ct. 1370, 55 L. Ed.2d 657 (1978). When open and explicit use of gender is employed, as is the case here, the systematic discrimination is in effect "admitted" by the employer, and the case will turn on whether such overt disparate treatment is for some reason justified under Title VII<span class="Italic">. See</span> RODNEY A. SMOLLA, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at &#x00A7; 9.03[6][a]. A justification for overt discrimination may exist if the disparate treatment is part of a legally permissible affirmative action program, or based on a BFOQ<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Southwood asserts that its gender-based staffing policy is justified as a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification, and therefore is exempt under Title VII. Under the BFOQ defense, overt gender-based discrimination can be countenanced if sex "is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of [a] particular business or enterprise[.]" 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(e)(1). The BFOQ defense is written narrowly, and the Supreme Court has read it narrowly. <span class="Italic">See Johnson Controls</span>, 499 U.S. at 201, 111 S. Ct. at 1204. The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to mean that discrimination is permissible only if those aspects of a job that allegedly require discrimination fall within the "'essence' of the particular business." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 206, 111 S. Ct. at 1207. Alternatively, the Supreme Court has stated that sex discrimination "is valid only when the essence of the business operation would be undermined" if the business eliminated its discriminatory policy. <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 332, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 2729, 53 L. Ed.2d 786 (1977) (quoting <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, Inc.</span>, 442 F.2d 385, 388 (5th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 404 U.S. 950, 92 S. Ct. 275, 30 L. Ed.2d 267 (1971)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer has the burden of establishing the BFOQ defense. <span class="Italic">Johnson Controls</span>, 499 U.S. at 200, 111 S. Ct. at 1204. The employer must have a "basis in fact" for its belief that no members of one sex could perform the job in question. <span class="Italic">Dothard</span>, 433 U.S. at 335, 97 S. Ct. at 2730. However, appraisals need not be based on objective, empirical evidence, and common sense and deference to experts in the field may be used. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (relying on expert testimony, not statistical evidence, to determine BFOQ defense); <span class="Italic">Torres v. Wisconsin Dep't Health and Social Servs.</span>, 859 F.2d 1523, 1531-32 (7th Cir. 1988) (in establishing a BFOQ defense, defendants need not produce objective evidence, but rather employer's action should be evaluated on basis of totality of circumstances as contained in the record), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 489 U.S. 1017, 109 S. Ct. 1133, 103 L. Ed.2d 194, and 489 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 1537, 103 L. Ed.2d 841 (1989). The employer must also demonstrate that it "could not reasonably arrange job responsibilities in a way to minimize a clash between the privacy interests of the [patients], and the non-discriminatory principle of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Gunther v. Iowa State Men's Reformatory</span>, 612 F.2d 1079, 1086 (8th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 446 U.S. 966, 100 S. Ct. 2942, 64 L. Ed.2d 825 (1980). <span class="Italic">See Hardin v. Stynchcomb</span>, 691 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With these precepts in mind, we may now turn to the facts of this case. The "essence" of Southwood's business is to treat emotionally disturbed and sexually abused adolescents and children. Southwood has presented expert testimony that staffing both males and females on all shifts is necessary to provide therapeutic care. "Role modeling," including parental role modeling, is an important element of the staff's job, and a male is better able to serve as a male role model than a female and vice versa. A balanced staff is also necessary because children who have been sexually abused will disclose their problems more easily to a member of a certain sex, depending on their sex and the sex of the abuser. If members of both sexes are not on a shift, Southwood's inability to provide basic therapeutic care would hinder the "normal operation" of its "particular business." Therefore, it is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of Southwood to have at least one member of each sex available to the patients at all times.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is authority for the proposition that a business that has as its "essence" a therapeutic mission requires the consideration of gender in making employment decisions. In <span class="Italic">City of Philadelphia v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission</span>, 7 Pa. Cmwlth. 500, 300 A.2d 97 (1973), the court determined that gender may be considered in order to treat and supervise children with emotional and social problems, and approved the youth center's gender-based staffing policy under the BFOQ defense. The <span class="Italic">City of Philadelphia</span> court stated that "[i]t is common sense that a young girl with a sexual or emotional problem will usually approach someone of her own sex, possibly her mother, seeking comfort and answers." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 300 A.2d at 103. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Torres v. Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services</span>, 859 F.2d 1523 (7th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 489 U.S. 1017, 109 S. Ct. 1133, 103 L. Ed.2d 194, and 489 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 1537, 103 L. Ed.2d 841 (1989), the court determined that the essence of a maximum security prison was rehabilitation. The <span class="Italic">Torres</span> court remanded the case to the district court for further fact-finding based on expert opinion and common-sense understanding of penal conditions in order to determine whether a female-only staffing policy was necessary to the institution's goal of rehabilitation. Still, the <span class="Italic">Torres</span> court held that a maximum security prison's policy of employing only female corrections officers for the female inmates' living quarters could be justified to achieve the institution's rehabilitative mission. One of the reasons for the decision was the fact that a high percentage of female inmates had been physically and sexually abused by males. In this case, Southwood has established a basis in fact through expert opinion that the therapeutic aspects of the child care specialist job require the consideration of gender.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to therapeutic goals, privacy concerns justify Southwood's discriminatory staffing policy. Southwood established that adolescent patients have hygiene, menstrual, and sexuality concerns which are discussed more freely with a staff member of the same sex. Child patients often must be accompanied to the bathroom, and sometimes must be bathed. The Supreme Court has explicitly left open the question whether sex constitutes a BFOQ when privacy interests are implicated, <span class="Italic">Johnson Controls, Inc.</span>, 499 U.S. at 206 n.4, 111 S. Ct. at 1207 n.4, and the issue has been raised but not yet decided by our court. <span class="Italic">See Rider v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</span>, 850 F.2d 982 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 993, 109 S. Ct. 556, 102 L. Ed.2d 582 (1988). We note that other circuits have discussed privacy concerns as the basis of a BFOQ defense. However, those cases involve an inmate's right to privacy which is balanced against the state's legitimate penological interest. <span class="Italic">See Nina Jordan v. Booth Gardner et al.</span>, 986 F.2d 1521, 1524 (9th Cir. 1993) ("prisoners' legitimate expectations of bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex are extremely limited"); <span class="Italic">Kent v. Johnson</span>, 821 F.2d 1220, 1226 (6th Cir. 1987) (balancing privacy interests of inmates with state's interest in prison security); <span class="Italic">Gunther v. Iowa State Men's Reformatory</span>, 612 F.2d 1079, 1086 (8th Cir. 1980) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the non-prison context, other courts have held that privacy concerns may justify a discriminatory employment policy<span class="Italic">. See AFSCME v. Michigan Council 25</span>, 635 F. Supp. 1010 (E.D. Mich. 1986) (privacy rights of mental health patients can justify a BFOQ to provide for same-sex personal <span id="Page_981"></span>hygiene care); <span class="Italic">Fesel v. Masonic Home of Delaware</span>, 447 F. Supp. 1346, 1353 (D.

Ark. 1981) (essence of obstetrics nurse's business is to provide sensitive care for patient's intimate and private concerns), <span class="Italic">vacated as moot</span>, 671 F.2d 1100 (8th Cir. 1982). Even in the prison context, one court of appeals has held that privacy concerns may be the basis for excluding male corrections officers from female inmate living quarters. <span class="Italic">See Torres</span>, 859 F.2d at 1531 ("the presence of unrelated males in living spaces where intimate bodily functions take place is a cause of stress to females").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that due to both therapeutic and privacy concerns, Southwood is an institution in which the sexual characteristics of the employee are crucial to the successful performance of the job of child care specialist. Southwood cannot rearrange job responsibilities in order to spare Healey or another female from working the night shift because at least one female and male should be available at all times in order for Southwood to conduct its business. Accordingly, we hold that the essence of Southwood's business would be impaired if it could not staff at least one male and female child care specialist on each shift.</p>
