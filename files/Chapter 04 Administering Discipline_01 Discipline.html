<h2 class="h2" id="ch04">DISCIPLINE</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Although disciplinary action is not something we like to think about -- or do -- it's a tool that must be used to maintain an effective and efficient workforce. Allowing some employees to disregard the rules necessary to maintain an effective organization can affect the performance of other employees and undercut their morale, as well as your supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Effective discipline is a team effort involving line management, HR, and legal counsel. Disciplinary actions not only have to fit the offense, but must be in compliance with laws, regulations, and the collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Purpose of discipline.</b> Short of removal, the objective of disciplinary action is to correct unacceptable work-related behavior, not to punish or humiliate the employee. Penalties should be chosen with a goal of producing the desired result and correcting the unacceptable behavior. If the misconduct persists despite repeated and increasingly severe discipline, removal becomes the likely option.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In general, the minimum penalty necessary to correct the misconduct should be applied. You are free to exercise judgment in suggesting what penalty should be applied in each case. However, you should avoid unduly harsh or extreme penalties out of anger or a desire to "make an example."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It does no good to impose an excessively severe penalty only to have it reversed in an appeal or grievance. Ultimately, it will be a deciding official who determines what penalty the agency will impose.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Counseling</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">One of the keys to effective discipline is early intervention, usually with a counseling session. Sometimes the best disciplinary action is the one you didn't have to take because you intervened as soon as a problem became evident, instead of waiting until it evolved into a serious problem. Tardiness and AWOL are prime examples.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In order to turn such encounters into positive, productive situations, keep the following best practices in mind:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r"><b>1.</b></span> <b>Keep it calm and unemotional.</b> If you don't, any number of unproductive things can happen, including a shouting match, a permanently damaged relationship, and even violence.</li>
<li><span class="num-r"><b>2.</b></span> <b>Focus on the behavior, not the individual.</b> In other words, direct your remarks to what was done wrong, why it was wrong, and the adverse effect it had or could have on the operation. Do not berate the employee for character flaws, real or imagined.</li>
<li><span class="num-r"><b>3.</b></span> <b>Point out the desired behavior.</b> If the employee is chronically late, point out things the employee can do to avoid having the last-minute problems that may be causing the tardiness. But above all, stress what behavior is required; i.e., timely arrival at work.</li>
<li><span class="num-r"><b>4.</b></span> <b>End on a positive note.</b> In other words, don't send the employee out the door with threats of further action, but rather with an assurance that the employee is still a valued member of the work group.</li>
<li><span class="num-r"><b>5.</b></span> <b>Record the counseling session in a memorandum to the employee.</b> If the counseling is not successful, this memorandum will help support disciplinary action by proving the employee was put on notice of the need to improve conduct.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Counseling memoranda.</b> There are different disciplinary actions but counseling is not one. A counseling memorandum or letter of instruction is an informal notification from a manager calling an employee's attention to the need for him to improve in areas such as conduct, performance, or attendance. Whether issued orally or in writing, such reminders are a regular part of daily supervision and are not considered penalty actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Usually, copies of counseling memos are maintained by the manager and are not filed in the employee's official personnel folder. You cannot cite these letters as previous disciplinary offenses for determining whether a second or third offense has occurred in determining a penalty. However, they may prove useful to document that the employee was fully aware of the nature of the misconduct if formal discipline becomes necessary later.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Progressive discipline</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Discipline is progressive when it starts at a low level (reprimand or suspension) and, if the same or similar misconduct is repeated, escalates to higher levels of severity until the employee is removed from the agency. Some offenses are so objectionable that they are not suitable for progressive penalties and may justify removal even for a first offense. An example is an unprovoked physical assault on a supervisor. The lowest level of discipline is the <a href="file:///CF3/index.jsp?contentId=5010&amp;chunkid=214453">written reprimand</a>. Similar-sounding punishments, such as a letter of caution, an admonishment, or a letter of instruction, are not truly disciplinary because they usually are not grievable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reprimand usually is issued by the immediate supervisor, but the level of delegated authority varies by agency. It remains in the employee's official personnel file for a period of one to two years, depending on agency policy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are points you should know:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Informal counseling doesn't count.</b> Documented counseling can show an employee was on notice of a rule violation, but by itself, doesn't establish a disciplinary record.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Consult HR.</b> Go to the employee relations specialists in your servicing HR office as soon as you see a disciplinary situation developing and follow their advice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Consult with higher management.</b> Agency policy likely requires a higher-level manager to approve a suspension or removal for misconduct. Don't blindside the managers who will have to approve the discipline.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Move to discipline quickly.</b> Start formal discipline as soon as it is obvious that an informal discussion won't help, or immediately on a more serious violation. The first step of progressive discipline is usually a formal reprimand, which supervisors usually may issue on their own. But, after consulting with HR, you may move to suspension or even removal without intermediate penalties if the misconduct is severe enough.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Consider the efficiency of the service.</b> Consider the effect of misconduct on your unit and its operations when you consider charges and determine penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Beyond a reprimand, you can propose that an employee be suspended. Suspension is a non-duty/non-pay status imposed for disciplinary reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no limit on how long an employee can be suspended. That said, many agencies take the position that if an offense warrants more than a 14-day suspension, a removal action should be taken instead. OPM's regulations reiterate this by stating that suspensions should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Beyond suspensions are demotions and removal, serious actions that require consultation with HR and legal counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Using progressive discipline will help ensure that your penalty determination survives the review of the MSPB or an arbitrator for its reasonableness. If you are providing the employee with notice, written reprimands, suspensions, and opportunities to improve, you are going a long way toward a reasonable penalty determination under the <i>Douglas</i> factors analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Agencies are not required to use progressive discipline, and the use of it has never been mandated by law or regulation. However, collective bargaining agreements may have provisions requiring progressive discipline for particular types of misconduct. Make sure to consult any applicable CBA for such requirements.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Suspensions of 14 days or less</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee's misconduct warrants more significant discipline than a letter of reprimand but is not quite serious enough to call for a suspension of more than 14 days, demotion, or removal, you may be looking at placing the employee on a short-term suspension of 14 days or less. Generally, short-term suspensions aren't appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board unless they involve allegations of whistleblower retaliation or discrimination based on military status. They are usually left to your agency to handle through its administrative grievance process, other dispute resolution process, or negotiated grievance process for bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under Title 5 Chapter 75, employees can be suspended for 14 days or less to promote the efficiency of the service. You will usually propose a short-term suspension before more serious steps are taken unless the misconduct at issue is so serious that it warrants severe action, including removal, for the first offense. In a progressive discipline model, counseling lays the foundation for you to issue a letter of reprimand or short-term suspension, which in turn lays the groundwork for you to take adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Purpose.</b> Generally, the objective of discipline is to correct deficiencies in employee conduct and performance -- not to punish the employee. Discipline can deter misconduct and correct situations that interfere with the efficiency of civil service. Documenting misconduct is imperative to support any conduct-based action and if progressive discipline is initiated based on repeated misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Conduct-based actions are important tools designed to help managers maintain an efficient and orderly work environment. Furthermore, misconduct should be addressed when deficiencies are first noted, for example, when an employee refuses or fails to comply with a rule, regulation, or law within the workplace. Determining the appropriate course of action is ultimately management's responsibility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Managers should consult with employee relations staff for help in navigating technical or complex laws, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements and when considering available options.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Process.</b> The following are the traditional steps taken in the disciplinary action process:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 1: Identify the problem.</b> A potential issue of misconduct can be brought to your attention by others, detected in reports or data, or directly observed. Understand what your agency considers misbehavior. If the matter falls in a gray area, don't guess or assume or permit your own values to influence your judgment. Ask your ER or HR office for guidance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 2: Investigate the matter.</b> Your first order of business is to investigate the matter. Collect evidence such as emails, data reports, system tracking records, mileage logs, credit card statements, copies of customer complaints, and expense reports. Interview witnesses and get statements. You want to conduct an impartial and fair investigation, so if it's appropriate, ask the employee for their side of the story before proceeding. Providing a full picture of events reduces the likelihood of those further up the chain reaching erroneous conclusions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Now piece together everything you've gathered and decide if you believe discipline is warranted. You may seek assistance from your ER or HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 3: Determine whether action should be taken.</b> If you find that there is no offense warranting discipline, then don't take action. If you find that an offense has occurred and a short-term suspension is the appropriate penalty, proceed to the next step. If you feel that a more serious adverse action is appropriate, proceed to the section on <b>Adverse actions</b>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 4: Prepare the notice of proposed action.</b> The notice of proposed action -- also referred to as the "proposal notice" or "proposal letter" -- is the first formal procedural right in the process to which employees are entitled. They have the right to an advance written notice of what they are being charged with and what disciplinary action management is considering imposing. Regulations also state that employees must be told of their rights to review the material that the agency is relying upon, to have an attorney or other representative, and to appeal any action that is ultimately imposed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Proposal notices are covered in depth in the <b>Notice of proposed action</b> section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 5: Provide the employee with an opportunity to reply.</b> The employee is then provided an opportunity to explain to the deciding official either why the charges are not accurate or why the proposed punishment is not appropriate. By statute, the employee is entitled to a reasonable time to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer. OPM regulations add that this period to reply cannot be less than 24 hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee has a right to be represented in this process either by an attorney, a union officer, or another person authorized by the employee. OPM's regulations say that the representative cannot have a conflict of interest or be an employee who is needed for priority work assignments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 6: Consider all the evidence, including the employee's reply.</b> The deciding official will determine what action to ultimately take. The deciding official has a responsibility to consider the reply of the employee, any evidence supplied by the employee, and the evidence upon which the proposing official based their recommendation. Evidence cannot be considered unless the employee was informed of it and given an opportunity to rebut it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the deciding official obtains new information, the employee must be informed of it and be provided with an opportunity to respond. The original proposal can be rescinded and a new proposal issued if the agency deems it appropriate. For example, if the deciding official determines that there are errors in the proposed action or that action is warranted on a different basis, they can direct the proposing official to prepare a new proposal. If you are acting as a deciding official and find yourself in this situation, consult HR and/or legal counsel to determine the appropriate way to proceed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Supported or unsupported:</b> If the deciding official finds that the evidence does not support the charges, then the employee will be notified that action will not be taken. If the deciding official finds that evidence supports the charges, then the action will go forward.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 7: Determine the appropriate penalty.</b> If the deciding official finds that the evidence supports the charges, they must decide whether the proposed short-term suspension is the appropriate penalty. The deciding official may decide that a lesser penalty, such as a letter of reprimand or a shorter suspension is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency may have a table of penalties that guides deciding officials in determining which penalty is likely to be appropriate. There is generally a range for the recommended penalty. For example, if an employee reports to duty under the influence of alcohol, the penalty for a first offense may range from a reprimand to removal, depending upon how much the intoxication interfered with the maintenance of order in the workplace, how much it affected the individual's ability to perform assigned duties, and whether the safety of personnel or property was placed in danger.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The table of penalties is only guidance, and agency officials must exercise their own judgment. Ideally, the least severe penalty necessary to correct misconduct and to discourage repetition should be selected. However, a penalty outside the table's recommended range may be used when the situation warrants it. Just make sure to explain the evidence and circumstances that justify a departure from the table's range of penalties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The deciding official must also consider the <i>Douglas</i> factors in determining the appropriate disciplinary penalty for an employee. When taking disciplinary action, OPM's regulations say that agencies should consider an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all applicable prior misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 8: Prepare the notice of decision.</b> Once the deciding official reaches a decision to implement disciplinary action, the employee must be issued a written notice of decision -- referred to as the "decision," "decision notice," or "decision letter" -- at the earliest practicable date, on or before the effective date of the action. OPM requires that the employee must also be notified of any complaint or grievance rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 9: Issue the decision letter to the employee.</b> Some agencies require, either in their regulations or the collective bargaining agreement, that a meeting be held to personally deliver the decision to the employee and his representative(s); others simply mail it. If your agency has such requirements, you have to follow them. if not, there's no reason to do more than you have to in order to ensure proper delivery of the decision. The <b>Removal and Termination Notices</b> section provides advice on delivering a decision to an employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>After the decision has been issued.</b> The employee may file an EEO discrimination complaint, an administrative grievance, or exercise the negotiated grievance process if they are a member of a collective bargaining unit. The collective bargaining agreement may provide other options. However, once an employee selects one avenue for redress, they generally cannot later make use of the others.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Adverse actions</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Removals, demotions, and suspensions of more than 14 days may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board. A removal action ends the employment of an individual. A demotion action is the umbrella term for actions involving a reduction in grade or a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You should work with your employee relations staff and legal office when considering these actions because the employee has certain rights provided by statute and OPM regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The following are the major steps in the process to take an adverse action under Chapter 75 of Title 5, which is the statute that authorizes an agency to take an action to advance the efficiency of the service. These steps will enable you to understand the overall process in chronological order. If you are seeking to impose a suspension of 14 days or less, you should follow the steps in the previous section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 1: Identify the problem.</b> A potential issue of misconduct can be brought to your attention by others, detected in reports or data, or directly observed.

By statute, the employee is entitled to a reasonable time to answer orally and/or in writing, but not less than seven days. The employee may furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer. OPM regulations add that if the employee is still working, the "agency must give the employee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee has a right to be represented in this process either by an attorney, a union officer, or another person authorized by the employee. OPM's regulations say that the representative cannot have a conflict of interest or be an employee who is needed for priority work assignments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee may submit medical documentation if they want the agency to consider any medical conditions which may contribute to the misconduct problem. It should be noted, however, that an agency may hold employees with disabilities with reasonable accommodation to the same standards of conduct as nondisabled employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Step 6: Consider all the evidence, including the employee's reply.</b> A deciding official reviews the proposal, supporting documentation, medical documentation if submitted, and any reply provided by the employee. The deciding official will determine which action to ultimately take and may consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and in the answer of the employee or their representative. Evidence cannot be considered unless the employee was informed of it and given an opportunity to rebut it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the deciding official obtains new information, the employee must be informed of it and be provided an opportunity to respond. The original proposal can be rescinded and a new proposal issued if the agency deems it appropriate. For example, if the deciding official determines that there are errors in the proposed action or that action is warranted on a different basis, they can direct the proposing official to prepare a new proposal. If you are acting as a deciding official and find yourself in this situation, consult HR and/or legal counsel to determine the appropriate way to proceed. Do not act alone on this. If the situation is handled incorrectly, it could result in the reversal of the action on review by the MSPB or an arbitrator based on a due process violation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Supported or unsupported:</b> If the deciding official finds that the evidence does not support the charges, then the employee will be notified that action will not be taken.

'</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In assessing whether the proposed adverse action based on the misconduct promotes the efficiency of the service, the deciding official must explain in the decision letter whether the charges are supported, and if so, whether the proposed penalty is warranted after taking into consideration mitigating and aggravating factors. The deciding official may determine that a lesser penalty than was proposed should be imposed. The decision letter also must inform the employee of any appeal or grievance rights they may have if discipline is taken.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Your agency will maintain copies of the notice of proposed action, the employee's written reply, a summary of the employee's oral reply, if any, the decision notice, and any supporting material. The agency will furnish these documents to the MSPB, other reviewing authority, and the employee upon their request.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Notice of proposed action</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A notice of proposed action -- also referred to as a "proposal notice" or a "proposal letter" -- is issued to inform an employee that the agency is proposing to take an adverse action against them. This document tells the employee that they've done something wrong, what that something is, why it's wrong, and how you plan to address it. If you write and issue the proposal notice, you are referred to as the "proposing official."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Proposal notices must state the specific reasons for the proposed action and inform employees of their right to review the material that was relied on to support the reasons for the proposed action. Proposal notices also must list all the aggravating penalty factors that the agency intends to rely on in its penalty analysis. Provide as much detail as possible so the employee can respond to what you're saying.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The proposal notices include the following information:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Notice of the law or regulation under which the action is being taken.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Clear charge(s) and specification(s).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Who the deciding official will be, how to contact them, the deadline to submit a written reply, and the deadline to make an appointment for any oral reply.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Notice that the employee can choose to have a representative (such as a private attorney or union representative).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Information on how the employee can obtain a copy of (or access to) the evidence.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Notice of the proposed penalty and the factors the deciding official will consider when determining the appropriate penalty. Any aggravating factors -- circumstances that provide a basis for enhancing the severity of a penalty -- considered in deciding on a penalty must be included in the proposal notice for removals, demotions, and suspensions of more than 14 days.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Detailed information regarding the employee's appeal rights if the action is imposed, including where the employee may file an appeal. Your HR office and/or agency counsel should handle writing this section to make sure that all the appeal rights information required by law is included.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">For removals, demotions, and suspensions of more than 14 days, the proposal notice will be effective no earlier than 30 calendar days from the date of the proposal if the action is found warranted by the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When determining the appropriate penalty for an employee, you must evaluate and balance the <i>Douglas</i> factors, which is a set of 12 factors set forth by the Merit Systems Protection Board. For more information, the <i>Douglas</i> Factors section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Check with your HR office to see if your agency uses a particular format for proposal notices, but they generally follow this format:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Introduction.</b> This part spells out the proposed action.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Example: <i>This is advance notice that I propose to remove you from your position as GS-13 Soils Scientist, not sooner than 30 days from your receipt of this notice, for the following reasons:</i></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Charges and specifications.</b> This section describes the misconduct and provides all the details the employee will need to make a meaningful reply to the notice. Every proposal notice must have at least one charge. There is no limit to the number of charges a manager can use in a proposal notice, but most have one to three charges. Review the Charge Writing Key Topic for full details on how to draft charges and specifications.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Example: <i><b>Willful misuse of a government vehicle.</b> At about 9 p.m. on May 11, 20XX, you were driving a government vehicle, Ford Explorer license number A151445, on Calle de la Revolucion, in Tijuana, Mexico. You were stopped by Tijuana Police Officer Hernando Franco for driving erratically and were given a traffic citation. Although you were authorized to drive the government vehicle in San Diego during your official trip there, you were not authorized to drive to Tijuana, Mexico.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Example: <i><b>Carrying an unauthorized person in a government vehicle.</b> At 9 p.m., May 11, 20XX, when you were driving the Ford Explorer on Calle de la Revolucion in Tijuana, Mexico, you were carrying Maria Corazon in the vehicle. Ms. Corazon, an employee of a social club located on that street, was not a federal employee, nor was she authorized to ride in a government vehicle.</i></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Penalty analysis.</b> Here, the penalty is discussed, including the reasoning for how it was decided. You should use the <i>Douglas</i> factors to help you determine the appropriate penalty, including aggravating and mitigating factors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Example: <i>I am proposing removal rather than a lesser penalty because of your formal disciplinary record. Specifically, you have received three formal disciplinary actions within the past three years. On Sept. 21, 20XX, you received a one-day suspension for discourteous behavior toward the public. On March 22, 20XX, you were suspended three days for unauthorized absence (AWOL). On July 14, 20XX, you were suspended five days for using vulgar language to coworkers.</i></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Employee's rights.</b> The proposal notice must advise the employee about rights to obtain representation (such as an attorney), to review the material on which the proposal is based, and to reply to the proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Example: <i>You have the right to a representative of your choice. You also have the right to review the material we have relied on in making this proposal. The material is attached to this letter. (Or: You may review this material by contacting [name] at [telephone number] or [email address]).</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>This notice is only a proposal and you have the right to reply orally and in writing. If you wish to send a written reply, you must do so before [date]. If you wish to reply orally, the person who will hear your reply will be [name], the Regional Director. An appointment can be made if replying orally by contacting [name] who will arrange the details with you.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee's rights section also must provide detailed information regarding the employee's appeal rights if an adverse action is imposed, including where the employee may file an appeal (for example, the MSPB, the EEOC, or a grievance if the employee is in a bargaining unit). Your HR office and/or agency counsel should handle writing this section to make sure that all the appeal rights information required by law is included.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Nexus statement.</b> Agencies often include a nexus statement in their proposal notices, but there is no requirement to do so. "Nexus" is the logical connection between what the employee did and the negative impact it has on the agency's operations or mission, known as "the efficiency of the service."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a nexus statement is included, it should be clearly designated as a nexus statement. Don't mix it in with other parts of the proposal notice, especially the charges. Agencies often get into trouble by including language that is, in effect, the nexus statement in a charge. When that happens, the agency will have to prove that nexus information as part of the charge.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Due process violations</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Merit Systems Protection Board will reverse an adverse action -- regardless of whether the charges are proven and the penalty is reasonable -- if the employee is not provided with notice of the charges that satisfies the requirements of the U.S. Constitution or with an opportunity to respond to those charges. When this occurs, an employee's due process rights are violated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Due process requires:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Notice to the employee of the reason(s) their supervisor is taking the adverse action (provided in the notice of proposed action).</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> The employee be provided an opportunity to respond to the notice and to argue that the adverse action should not be taken.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> A fair, impartial decision relative to the proposed action.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b><i>Ward</i> violations.</b> There are several different types of due process violations that may occur during the adverse action process, but in this chapter we are going to focus on the type referred to as "<i>Ward</i> violations." "<i>Ward</i>" refers to the MSPB decision, <i>Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</i>, which provides the standards for analyzing whether a violation has occurred. This type of due process violation happens when a deciding official relies on new and material <i>ex parte</i> information as a basis for their decision a proposed charge or the penalty to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Ex parte</i> communication is an oral or written communication about issues in a case between the deciding official and an interested party -- for instance, the proposing official or coworkers -- without the other party's knowledge. <i>Ex parte</i> information also includes information known personally to the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are some common examples of <i>ex parte</i> communications:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Past discipline not mentioned in the proposal notice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Misconduct that wasn't charged or otherwise referenced in the proposal notice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Misconduct or poor performance that occurred outside of a time period set in the proposal notice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use of a different table of penalties or different charges in the table than was referenced in the proposal notice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Deciding official's personal knowledge of the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Deciding official's research about an employee (for example, an internet search or additional investigation of a matter at issue).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Deciding official's discussion of the matter with supervisors, coworkers, or outside consultants or experts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Does it violate due process rights?</b> If, when you are acting as a deciding official, you receive new and material information by means of <i>ex parte</i> communications, the employee is no longer on notice of all the reasons for their dismissal and the evidence relied upon by the agency. However, not all <i>ex parte</i> information that introduces new and material information rises to the level of a due process violation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The MSPB has a set of factors it will use to make a determination of whether the <i>ex parte</i> information a deciding official has received amounts to a due process violation. If you find yourself in possession of <i>ex parte</i> information, don't try to make this determination on your own. Consult your ER specialist or agency counsel on how to proceed. If they find a potential due process violation exists before you've issued the final decision, the situation usually can be fixed by providing notice of the information to the employee and giving them an opportunity to respond. This will result in the adverse action process taking a bit longer, but it's better for that to happen than to have the adverse action reversed on appeal due to a due process violation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Alternative discipline</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Alternative discipline is any form of action taken to correct behavior other than the traditional disciplinary methods used in the government. Therefore, alternative discipline is generally not a reprimand, a suspension, a demotion, or a removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A common-sense approach usually leads a manager to consider alternative discipline. The following scenario illustrates this rationale:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>On a number of occasions, an employee is placed on AWOL for his regular absences. The employee has already suffered a self-inflicted loss of pay for those days when he did not come to work to perform the assigned duties. Sending the employee home with no duties and no pay, via suspension, is not likely to alter the conduct when the employee has already chosen to do without the duties and pay despite knowing the conduct was unacceptable. Imposing discipline that causes the same result as the misconduct does not adequately send the message that the conduct must cease. Under circumstances such as these, you may wish to try a method other than a suspension with a loss of duties and pay.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are numerous reasons agencies are experimenting with and, in some cases, routinely using alternative discipline approaches:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>It fits some offenses better.</b> For example, rather than send an already AWOL employee home, the agency might require the employee to put in more time at work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>It fits some employees better.</b> The numerous options give managers greater latitude in matching the action to the personality of the employee whose conduct needs correcting. What works well for one person may have no impact on another.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>It avoids the legalistic approach of traditional discipline and grievance appeal systems.</b> Penalizing an employee for their wrongdoing without going through the legal process saves time and money while still getting the point across.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>It has a better chance of reaching the root of the employee's misconduct.</b> The employee is usually required to admit to the misconduct involved, and to commit to avoiding it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Some agencies use alternative discipline while others do not. Always check with your HR staff to determine if this is an option for you. Never apply alternative discipline on your own accord.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The following are examples of alternative approaches some agencies have used. The list is not exhaustive, and managers should ensure that the penalty is appropriate and in compliance with agency regulations, collective bargaining agreements, and any applicable statutes:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Paper-only suspensions.</b> Rather than lose the employee's services for some period of time, the agency simply documents the offense and notes its severity in the event of future offenses.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Leave donation.</b> The employee donates annual leave to a leave bank or leave transfer program equal to the amount of time that would have been spent on a suspension.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Community service.</b> Service is performed in an amount equal to the time that would have been spent on a suspension.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Apology letter.</b> The employee issues an apology (for example, via email) to those individuals affected by the misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Research misconduct issue.</b> Employee performs research on the issue of the particular misconduct to better understand the harm it causes to the work unit and then provides training or a briefing to others to share the knowledge.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>EAP attendance.</b> The parties arrange for the employee to attend a specific program approved by the Employee Assistance Program. Examples might be a debt management class for credit card abuse or anger management sessions after "getting in the face" of a supervisor or coworker.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Less desirable shift.</b> Employee agrees to work less desirable duty shifts for a particular period of time (provided there is no collective bargaining agreement prohibition on this).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Weekend "suspension."</b> The "suspension" occurs on a weekend or other non-duty day to enable the agency to continue to use the employee's services and to prevent a financial impact on the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Reduced suspension days.</b> The agency agrees to reduce the number of days to be served on suspension. In return, the employee takes personal responsibility for the inappropriate behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Intermittent suspension.</b> Employee serves a suspension in smaller pieces over the course of multiple pay periods to soften the financial impact.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>LWOP suspension.</b> Employee's suspension is recorded as LWOP so that there will be no permanent record of a disciplinary action.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Penalty held in abeyance.</b> The action (typically a suspension) takes effect only if there is a recurrence of the conduct within a specified period of time.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Last chance agreement.</b> A last chance agreement is the employee's "last chance" before being removed. Last chance agreements are issued after a proposed removal, but the removal decision is held in abeyance for a period, usually two to three years.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Most types of alternative discipline require the employee to admit to the misconduct involved and create a "paper trail" documenting the matter as a disciplinary action. Since the employee admits to the conduct, the burden of further grievance steps and appeals is avoided.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Last chance and last rites agreements</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Another approach to addressing misconduct without taking a formal adverse action is to enter into a settlement agreement with the employee to resolve the matter. The type of agreement that is appropriate to use depends on the specific circumstances of the situation. Also keep in mind that a settlement agreement is a contract, and it must be drafted properly to avoid problems and meet legal requirements. Therefore, you must work with your HR office if you feel that a settlement agreement may be the best way to handle the situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Last chance agreements.</b> A <a href="file:///CF3/index.jsp?contentId=5010&chunkid=469473">last chance agreement</a> (also referred to as a "last chance settlement" or "abeyance agreement") is an agreement in which the agency agrees to forgo a proposed adverse action (usually removal) in return for the employee's agreement to meet certain conduct or performance requirements. This approach gives the employee a last opportunity at redemption rather than removal. A LCA is a contract that is usually negotiated between the deciding official and the employee after the employee has responded to a proposed removal. The agreement will have these main elements:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An acknowledgment that the charged misconduct (or unacceptable performance) occurred and that removal would be a reasonable penalty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A promise by the agency that it will hold off on the implementation of its decision to terminate the employee in abeyance for some specific period of time, usually one to two years.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A promise by the employee that they will refrain from future misconduct or raise their performance level during the abeyance period and will accept immediate termination if future misconduct or poor performance occur.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Sometimes either the employee or the agency will demand additional provisions be added to this agreement. For example, the agency may want the employee to agree to periodic drug testing. An employee may want a provision that the agency agrees to expunge all documentation referring to the proposed removal if the employee fully complies with the agreement and stays in their job. In most cases, the employee agrees to waive the right to appeal a subsequent adverse action based on the employee's failure to comply with the last chance agreement's terms.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> It's possible your collective bargaining agreement has provisions regarding last chance agreements, such as the availability of union representation at a meeting to discuss a LCA or a requirement that a LCA be supported by "just cause." An LR specialist should be consulted to ensure that the LCA complies with the CBA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Last rites agreements.</b> An agency also can enter into a different type of settlement agreement after it has decided the employee will be removed, but before it has formally proposed the action. This type of settlement may be referred to as a "last rites agreement." Other terms you may encounter are "exit agreement" or "predecisional settlement agreement."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an LRA, the agency agrees to hold off on effecting the removal action provided that the employee search for another job outside the agency and if, within a specified period, the employee has not found other employment, the agency will process their resignation and/or retirement. The employee also usually agrees to waive their appeal rights in an LRA.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Indefinite suspensions</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension means placing an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay for an indeterminate period of time. To sustain an indefinite suspension, the agency must show that:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> It imposed the suspension for an authorized reason.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> The suspension has an ascertainable end (an event that will trigger the conclusion of the suspension).</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> The suspension bears a relationship (nexus) to the efficiency of the service.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> The penalty is reasonable.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">The MSPB has approved the use of indefinite suspensions in three limited circumstances:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> When the agency has reasonable cause to believe an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed -- pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding or any subsequent agency action following the conclusion of the criminal process.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> When the agency has legitimate concerns that an employee's medical condition makes their continued presence in the workplace dangerous or inappropriate -- pending a determination that the employee is fit for duty.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> When an employee's access to classified information has been suspended and the employee must have such access to perform their job -- pending a final determination on the employee's access to classified information.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">When an indefinite suspension lasts for more than 14 days, it becomes subject to the same procedural requirements as other suspensions of more than 14 days.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Administrative leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Say you get a complaint that an employee sexually harassed a coworker, or you find out that criminal charges based on alleged off-duty misconduct were brought against an employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You need to take some immediate action to stop any misconduct, or to get the employee out of the workplace if their presence could pose a danger to coworkers. But you also need to conduct a full investigation before deciding what, if any, personnel action should be taken against the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you're considering placing the employee on administrative leave, there are a few things you need to know before going forward.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Administrative Leave Act of 2016</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because Congress felt that agency use of administrative leave had exceeded reasonable amounts and resulted in significant cost to the government, it passed the Administrative Leave Act of 2016.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the act, Congress mandated sparing use of administrative leave. It also encouraged agencies to prioritize and quickly complete investigations in which employees have been placed on administrative leave. This would facilitate either returning employees to duty status or taking appropriate personnel action against them by the time the leave period ends.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The act defines "administrative leave" as leave without loss of or reduction in pay, leave to which an employee is otherwise entitled under law, or credit for time or service. The act doesn't apply to the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Considerations for placing an employee on administrative leave.</b> There are two types of administrative leave available under the act: investigative leave and notice leave. An agency may place an employee on investigative leave or notice leave only if it has:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Determined that the continued presence of the employee in the workplace may:
<ul class="bull-b">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pose a threat to themself or others.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Result in the destruction of evidence relevant to an investigation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Result in loss of or damage to government property.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Otherwise jeopardize legitimate government interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Considered:
<ul class="bull-b">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assigning the employee to duties in which they no longer pose a threat.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Allowing the employee to take leave for which they are eligible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Carrying the employee in absence without leave status if they are absent from duty without approved leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Curtailing the notice period if there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> And determined that none of the above options is appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Investigative leave.</b> An agency may place an employee on investigative leave if they are the subject of an investigation. During any calendar year, an agency may place an employee on administrative leave for 10 workdays, which may be extended.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the initial 10-work-day period expires, if the agency determines that more investigation is necessary, it may extend the leave for additional periods of up to 30 workdays. The total period of additional investigative leave is limited to 90 workdays.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Notice leave.</b> An agency may place an employee on notice leave if they are in a notice period. A notice period runs from the time an employee is provided notice of a proposed adverse action against them through the date when the agency may take the adverse action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may place an employee on notice leave following a placement on investigative leave if, not later than the day after the investigative leave ends, the agency proposes or initiates an adverse action against the employee, and the agency has determined that the employee's continued presence may:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pose a threat to themself or others.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Result in the destruction of evidence relevant to an investigation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Result in loss of or damage to government property.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Otherwise jeopardize legitimate government interests.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Placing an employee on administrative leave after an instance of possible misconduct should always be done with the knowledge and guidance of your HR office.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">When disciplinary actions fail, usually it's because someone has committed one or more of these mistakes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore unacceptable behavior in hopes that no one else will notice, it will correct itself, or the employee will eventually just go away.</b> What usually happens is that other employees do notice, and a lack of adequate response to the situation starts to undermine their morale. More often than not, without correction, the employee's behavior tends to get worse rather than better. Often this leads to a "last straw" incident, upon which the supervisor or manager attempts to make up for lost time by trying to impose a major penalty -- like removal -- based on all the prior misbehavior. In the absence of prior discipline, however, that rarely works.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>"Keep book" or "save up" a laundry list of occurrences that, when added together, can be used to justify a bigger penalty.</b> This runs counter to the idea of discipline as a corrective tool and eliminates the concept of progressive penalties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Apply inconsistent penalties.</b> The general rule is that employees in similar situations should receive similar penalties for similar offenses. Employees do not have to receive identical penalties. But if all relevant circumstances are similar, the penalties should be similar. Major differences in situation or circumstances can justify very different penalties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to identify or explain the reasons for suggesting a particular penalty.</b> Everyone who adjudicates grievances and appeals (for example, arbitrators and the MSPB) expects to hear the specific reasons why a particular penalty was selected. "It seemed reasonable at the time," or "I wanted to make an example of this guy," generally won't cut it. It's essential that you carefully think through the relevant factors involved in a situation, compare it to similar cases, and make a logical -- as opposed to an emotional -- decision. It is also critically important that you identify all the reasons you considered in suggesting a penalty. The MSPB has ruled that it is a "harmful error" to base a penalty on reasons (for example, past offenses) that are not mentioned in the proposal to discipline.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do I have to select the penalty level and draft the charges? Or is that something HR should do?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Managers play a primary role in selecting the proposed penalty. However, they should make sure that they work with HR and legal counsel to draft the charges. Managers are the ones who will be responsible for providing the documentation that goes into the charges, so it is important they take an active role in the process. The manager must ultimately "own" the decision because if grieved or appealed, it will be the manager who must defend it through testimony at a hearing, not HR or counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I've heard that I can only discipline an employee for "just cause" or the "efficiency of the service." What does that mean, and is there any difference?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Basically they amount to the same thing. Both rest on the idea that discipline is taken to correct rather than punish, that discipline should be imposed for justifiable reasons, and should occur within the framework of reasonable procedures. The efficiency of the service means that the misconduct must have a negative impact on the agency's operations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I've been told that "documentation" is the key to successful disciplinary actions. What exactly is documentation?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Documentation is a fancy word for nothing more complicated than keeping clear, dated notes of significant events as contemporaneously as possible. For example, "Employee Jones arrived 35 minutes late for work on 10/22/XX; I counseled him, advising that further late arrivals without good cause would result in an AWOL charge and discipline." These notes should be kept as part of a "system of records" within the agency, and the employee is notified of their existence and is allowed to review them. Talk with your HR staff on how documentation is handled at your agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Why is documentation so important?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> It establishes important facts -- dates, times, events, who said what to whom -- that are essential in supporting a disciplinary action, especially in the event that it's challenged through a grievance or appeal. Memories fade -- documentation does not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If a rule hasn't been enforced for a while, does that mean employees cannot be disciplined for breaking it?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You can't suddenly start enforcing a rule without warning. You can reinstate a rule by informing employees that you intend to do so starting now and that further infractions will result in discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does the union have to be involved in disciplinary situations?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> For bargaining unit employees, the union can be involved at virtually every stage of the disciplinary process, including investigative interviews, grievance or appeal meetings, and at hearings. The union's specific rights are usually spelled out in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What's the difference between misconduct and unacceptable performance?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Misconduct is the deliberate or careless violation of a rule, regulation, law, or requirement. Unacceptable performance is the failure to perform duties to the required level of quantity, quality, or timeliness in a performance standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How do "last chance agreements" work?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> A last chance agreement is used when an employee is on the verge of being removed. LCAs usually require the employee to avoid further infractions, and often to take additional actions, such as seeking EAP assistance. When using an LCA, it is common practice for an agency to require an employee to give up the right to appeal the ultimate disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does an employee have the right to remain silent if I want to ask questions about suspected misconduct?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No -- unless you are asking about misconduct that could involve criminal penalties. There's no right to remain silent where the misconduct could only lead to administrative penalties, such as suspension or removal. In fact, lying or refusal to cooperate with an administrative investigation is grounds for discipline up to and including removal, irrespective of the underlying misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does an employee have a right to have a union representative present if I'm asking questions that might lead to discipline?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, if the employee is in a bargaining unit, reasonably believes that discipline may result from their answers, and has asked for assistance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do I have to warn employees that they have the right to have a union representative during questioning?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Only if your labor agreement establishes that requirement. Most don't but check with your HR staff before proceeding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If an employee does have a union representative present during questioning, what role does the representative play in the situation?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> A union representative is entitled to assist the employee by asking questions that might bring useful facts to light, by making comments, and by conferring with the employee. The representative is not entitled to provide answers to the questions, however, or to interfere with or prevent you from obtaining answers directly from the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does placing an employee on AWOL status count as a disciplinary action?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, placement on AWOL or unauthorized absence status simply prevents payment for that period of time. Being placed on AWOL can provide a basis for subsequent discipline, however.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are supervisors held to a higher standard of conduct?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. It is true that all employees are held to a high standard of conduct. However, supervisors and managers are held to an even higher standard of conduct and the loss of trust in a supervisor or manager is considered especially detrimental to the mission of the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can past discipline for unrelated offenses that occurred years before the current action be discounted on appeal?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Prior disciplinary actions may be cited even if they involved unrelated offenses, but they are given more weight if they are recent and relevant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If the employee appeals the penalty, does the agency have to prove that it selected the minimal penalty necessary?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. An agency never has to prove that the penalty it chose was the least harsh. It must show that it considered the relevant factors and that the penalty was reasonable.</p>
