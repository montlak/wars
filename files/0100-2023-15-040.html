<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-41"><span class="space">L.</span> POSTPONEMENT OR CONTINUANCE OF HEARING</h3>
<p class="noindent">Requests for a postponement of the hearing should be submitted, in writing, to the administrative judge. Requests for postponement of the hearing date are sometimes referred to as requests for a continuance of the hearing date. Whatever label is used, the request is essentially one to move the hearing to another date. MD-110 at 7-17 provides that an administrative judge may "hold a hearing in abeyance in the event that a party is unable to proceed with the hearing for reasons such as illness, military assignment, or for other good cause shown."</p>
<p class="noindent">The request should set forth in detail the basis for requesting postponement of the hearing. It is a good practice to support requests for postponement with affidavits, given under oath or affirmation, providing the factual information behind the request. As with all other prehearing submissions, requests for postponement of a hearing should be served on the other party.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations do not require that a party seeking postponement contact the opposing party and determine if there is consent or opposition to any postponement, but doing so is good litigation practice. Most court rules require, for procedural motions, that the moving party contact the opposing party and indicate that party's consent or opposition in the motion. The MSPB also has adopted the contact requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.55(a). While not required by EEOC regulation, the requirement that a party seeking a postponement confer, in good faith, with the opposing party to determine if there is an objection has been incorporated into the standard Acknowledgment and Order in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, at App. B. When the opposing party consents, there also is the possibility of filing a joint motion for postponement of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Requests for a continuance will be granted only on a showing of good cause. Ordinarily, the unavailability of a witness is not good cause and, if the witness is truly unavailable, the judge will make alternative arrangements to secure the testimony of that witness.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 7-2 advises administrative judges to grant requests for postponement of the hearing sparingly:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge should apply strict criteria in considering whether to grant requests for postponement of the hearing so as to avoid undue delay and interference with case management. The Administrative Judge may choose not to grant such requests absent extenuating circumstances (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, hospitalization of a representative or death in a party's family). In the event that a witness is unavailable, the Administrative Judge may wish to proceed with the hearing and arrange to take the testimony of the witness at a later date.</p>
<p class="noindent">A request for a continuance to obtain representation will not be routinely granted. The administrative judge will examine the reasons why legal representation was not obtained sooner, or the reasons why a change in legal representation is necessary at the last moment, before ruling on such a request. In <span class="Italic">Hale v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03341 (2000), the Commission held that dismissal as a sanction for failure to request a continuance in writing to obtain representation was an overly harsh sanction. The Commission found there was no showing that the failure to submit the request in writing would unduly prejudice the agency or the hearing process and that the judge abused his discretion because he could have ordered the complainant to appear for the hearing without representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCarter v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15224 (2002), the Commission found the administrative judge abused her discretion in denying the complainant's request for a continuance and instead dismissing the complaint for failure to prosecute. In <span class="Italic">McCarter</span>, the request for a continuance came three weeks in advance of the scheduled hearing and was due to the complainant's belief that her representative was not providing her with good representation. After discharging her attorney, the complainant continued to participate in prehearing conferences. She also indicated that her previous attorney continued to retain case documents and that her mother, who was serving as her new representative, could not leave her father alone at that time due to illness. Finally, the agency representative supported the complainant's request for a continuance noting that his own mother-in-law was extremely ill and he may not be able to attend the scheduled hearing. There is no surprise that OFO reversed <span class="Italic">McCarter</span>, though it does cause one to wonder what the judge was thinking about.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision to grant a continuance is within the discretion of the administrative judge. Of course, because the complainant's right to a hearing lies in the balance, the Commission generally will scrutinize decisions to deny a continuance where such a decision may also deprive the complainant of a hearing. Still, there are circumstances under which the Commission will uphold such decisions. For example, in <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01956902 (1997), the administrative judge granted the appellant a continuance because his attorney was scheduled, on short notice, to appear in U.S. district court in a school desegregation case for a preliminary injunction hearing on the same day as the EEOC hearing. The appellant's attorney sought, and was granted, a one-day continuance. Unfortunately, the preliminary injunction hearing ran more than one day. The administrative judge denied a request for another continuance and told the appellant he either had to proceed representing himself, immediately choose another representative, or withdraw his request for a hearing and let the agency issue a final decision on the record. Acting on the advice of his attorney, the appellant persisted in his request for a continuance. In part, because the administrative judge and agency representative had traveled a considerable distance for the hearing, the Commission found the administrative judge was within her discretion in denying the continuance and canceling the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_458"></span>In <span class="Italic">Yusko v. USPS</span>, 01861770 (1987), the Commission found that a dismissal for failure to prosecute was improper where the complainant would not attend the hearing because his representative had to withdraw. The representative was leaving the area to attend law school and notified the administrative judge immediately upon receiving the hearing notice. The complainant's refusal to attend the hearing without a representative did not warrant dismissal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is an abuse of discretion for an AJ to refuse a motion for postponement where good cause is shown. For instance, the Commission found the AJ abused her discretion when she refused to postpone the hearing when the complainant's attorney explained that her father was dying in <span class="Italic">Estell L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019001532 (2021):</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her claim that the AJ abused her discretion by refusing the postponement request, despite good cause, Complainant cited to <span class="Italic">Eldakdoky v. Dep't of Agric</span>., Appeal No. 0120090553 (Feb. 5, 2009). In <span class="Italic">Eldakdoky</span>, the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> complainant voluntarily informed the agency and the AJ, on August 2, 2007 that he would be out of the country due to a family emergency until September 25, 2007. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When the complainant sent this notification out, he was not asking for a postponement, and there was nothing scheduled during his absence. However, on August 10, 2007, the AJ cancelled the hearing and remanded the complaint to the agency for a final decision on the basis that "[c]omplainant did not give any details for the undersigned administrative judge to make a finding that he stated good cause to hold this hearing procedure in abeyance while he is out of the country." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ refused to reinstate the hearing, and eventually a final Agency decision was issued. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On appeal to the Commission, we determined that the AJ had improperly cancelled the hearing and remanded the matter to the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission also determined that even assuming that Complainant's August 2, 2007 notification was a request to postpone the hearing, he had clearly demonstrated good cause in accordance with EEO MD-110, Ch. 7, &#x00A7; III(D) (Aug. 5, 2015). Specifically, the illness of a close family member. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant initially made her hearing request on April 23, 2016. On August 23, 2018, nearly two years later, the AJ held the first pre-hearing conference. During this pre-hearing conference, Complainant made her first request to postpone the hearing. At that time, the hearing was scheduled for September 10, 2018. Complainant clearly provided a good cause reason to postpone the hearing. Specifically, her attorney's need to take leave to care for her terminally ill father, who had in July 2018, received a diagnosis of late stage, terminal cancer. However, without more specificity as to why the hearing could not be postponed, the AJ declined the request and reminded Complainant of her option to withdraw her hearing request and seek a FAD. As noted in her appeal affidavit, Complainant stated that she was in a state of distraught, did not want to lose her "day in court," felt overwhelmed at the prospect of representing herself <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and did not believe she would get a fair chance through a FAD. Not wanting to lose her hearing date, Complainant moved forward as <span class="Italic">pro se</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, by September 4, 2018, the Attorney informed the AJ and Complainant that her father had passed away, and that she only needed a short period to grieve and tend to affairs before she would be ready to represent Complainant again. Considering the news, Complainant sought to postpone the September 10, 2018 hearing. However, Complainant asserted that during a September 4, 2018 phone call with the AJ, the AJ pressured Complainant to consider the difficulties of representing herself <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, declined to postpone the hearing, and again suggested that she consider requesting a FAD instead. Shortly after the phone call, Complainant requested a FAD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the extenuating circumstances, we agree with Complainant that there was good cause to postpone the hearing. Similar to <span class="Italic">Eldakdoky</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Attorney had presented good cause for postponing the hearing, specifically, at first, the terminal diagnosis of her father, and then, the actual passing of her father. While the Attorney did not provide an exact time frame, and only stated a "short" time, it is clear from the record that a postponement would have been suitable given the situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record clearly demonstrates the AJ's repeated refusals to postpone the hearing, and notably without providing Complainant any "Notice to Show Cause." In reviewing this matter, we also take into consideration Complainant's assertion that she felt pressured to forfeit her hearing because of the AJ's warnings of self-representation. Considering the number of claims here, the complexity of the file, and the lack of a sound explanation from the AJ why a postponement was refused, at least during the September 4, 2018 request, we find that Complainant established that the AJ abused her discretion in refusing to postpone the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is arbitrary and capricious for an administrative judge to deny a request for a continuance where, three days prior to the hearing, the appellant produces a certificate from a doctor stating the employee is ill and cannot attend functions for a two-week period. <span class="Italic">See Spanton v. Defense Contract Audit Agency</span>, 01831294 (1984). The physical incapacitation of the appellant's representative is sufficient grounds for postponement of a hearing and the complaint may not be dismissed due to failure to prosecute on the part of the complainant. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. USPS</span>, 01810831 (1981). Similarly, the Commission found that the administrative judge had abused his discretion in denying a postponement of a hearing where the sole law partner of the complainant's attorney had died a few months before and the complainant's attorney contended he was overwhelmed with the law practice and not adequately prepared for hearing. <span class="Italic">Novak v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120064825 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120963 (2012), the Commission found that the administrative judge abused his discretion where the complainant presented evidence that he was medically unable to proceed with the hearing even though the medical evidence did not establish when the complainant would be well enough to proceed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Santiago</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to EEOC's MD-110, Chapter 7, Section II1(D)(16), "[a]n Administrative Judge may hold a hearing in abeyance in the event that a party is unable to proceed with the hearing for reasons such as illness, military assignment, or for other good cause shown." In this case, Complainant presented adequate evidence in the form of documentation from his physicians that he was medically unable to adequately participate in the preparation of his case and in the hearing set for August 2011. As such, Complainant provided good cause for his request for a continuance of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the AJ correctly pointed out that no predictions had been provided for when Complainant would adequately recover to participate in a hearing, we find that the AJ's immediate cancellation of any hearing and the remand to the Agency for a decision on the record was premature. As the hearing was scheduled to occur only 49 days after Complainant's hearing request was acknowledged, this was not a case where undue delay would have resulted if the AJ had been willing to postpone the hearing for a reasonable length of time to allow Complainant's medical condition to improve. We note that there was no evidence that the Agency's case would have been prejudiced by a reasonable delay. We therefore conclude that the AJ abused his discretion by summarily and prematurely dismissing the case from the hearing process rather than granting a reasonable continuance subject to reevaluation if Complainant was still unable to participate. Accordingly, we are remanding the complaint back to reinstate Complainant's hearing request. Upon receipt of the case, the AJ should allow Complainant's attorney reasonable time to submit a motion justifying his request for permission to conduct discovery and should promptly rule on that motion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision of an administrative judge to deny a complainant's request for a continuance of the hearing is discretionary. When the administrative judge has properly exercised that discretion and the Commission determines a case must be remanded for further investigation, the complainant will not be entitled to a new hearing, absent compelling circumstances. For example, in <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930905 (1994), the complainant requested a continuance based on her inability to obtain legal representation and the fact that she had an MSPB hearing over an unrelated matter. The administrative judge denied the request and, subsequently, the complainant withdrew her request for a hearing. Although the Commission remanded the case for further investigation, it refused to grant the complainant the right to an administrative hearing. Instead, the agency was instructed to issue a new final agency decision, pending the completion of its supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01891834 (1989), the agency issued its final decision on the available record after a period of six months. The complainant had requested a new hearing, but could not state that "'he was ready, willing and able to pursue his case.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In finding that the agency had prematurely issued a final decision without a hearing, the Commission further noted that if the complainant's medical condition, which prevented him from traveling to the hearing site, was permanent, or was temporary but of such a duration that more than a reasonable period of time would pass before the complainant could travel to the hearing, then the administrative judge should consider alternative arrangements. Included in the alternatives was the possibility that the complainant could participate in the hearing via a telephone link. Another alternative noted by the Commission was to have the parties fully supplement the investigative record and have the administrative judge issue a recommended decision without a hearing. This alternative would probably not be viable, however, under the 1999 version of Part 1614, because there is no provision for administrative judges to issue decisions on the record other than summary judgment decisions, and a provision to allow administrative judges to issue decisions on the record where there are material disputes of fact was specifically rejected by the Commission in adopting its revised regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 63 Fed. Reg. 8557 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Todd v. Postmaster General</span>, 01892616 (1989), discussed in detail above in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-15-036.html#sec6-37">Notice of Remand</a>," raised another interesting scenario that occurs with some frequency due to the length of time it takes to administratively process an EEO complaint. In that case, the administrative processing took some four years. By that time, the complainant was no longer in California but had relocated to Finland. The complainant contended that he would make the sojourn to California for the hearing, but only if the agency would make assurances that the RMO would be present at the hearing and only <span id="Page_459"></span>if the agency provided an affidavit from the RMO so the complainant and his representative could prepare for the hearing. The Commission found these requests imminently reasonable, given the time and expense of the complainant in traveling to the hearing site.</p>
<p class="noindent">There can sometimes be a conflict between the agency's mandate to process a complaint without undue delay and a complainant's legitimate desire to postpone a hearing pending the occurrence of some event. In <span class="Italic">Appling v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01842397 (1986), the appellant filed a grievance over her termination from the agency. While the grievance was pending, the appellant applied for another job at the agency and was denied the position. She then filed an EEO complaint. The appellant's representative and the administrative judge agreed to postpone the hearing pending a decision on the removal arbitration. The agency was notified in writing of the postponement but proceeded to issue a final decision without a hearing. On appeal, the Commission remanded the case to the agency for a hearing noting "[t]he primary reason for requiring an agency to process a complaint without undue delay is to prevent undue prejudice to a complainant which can result from delay. Here, appellant wanted a postponement of the hearing. Thus, any resulting prejudice to appellant would have been due to her own actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, appellants should not interpret this case to mean that a postponement will be granted whenever they wish. It is clear in the <span class="Italic">Appling</span> case that a decision favorable to the agency would have rendered the EEO complaint moot and, thus, presented a reasonable basis for postponement of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing whether to postpone the hearing, the administrative judge should consider the reasons given by the requesting party. It was not a deliberate attempt to impede the proceedings when the appellant sought a five-month postponement of the hearing because he was on a probationary period at his new job. The appellant explained that there were stringent probationary requirements and that he could not take leave to attend the hearing while on probation. <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of Navy</span>, 01870797 (1987).</p>
