<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-127"><span class="space">1.</span>	Using Commission Case Law to Determine Damage Amounts</h4>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission issues more decisions affixing an amount of compensatory damages, its own case law becomes more significant in determining the amount of future awards. The Commission relies heavily upon its own case law in determining damage amounts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The original guidance on calculating nonpecuniary damage awards came in EEOC Notice N-915.002 at 10-14:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Nonpecuniary Losses</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Damages are available for the intangible injuries of emotional harm such as emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. Other nonpecuniary losses could include injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other nonpecuniary losses that are incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct. Nonpecuniary losses for emotional harm are more difficult to prove than pecuniary losses. Emotional harm will not be presumed simply because the complaining party is a victim of discrimination. The existence, nature, and severity of emotional harm must be proved. Emotional harm may manifest itself, for example, as sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, emotional distress, loss of self esteem, excessive fatigue, or a nervous breakdown. Physical manifestations of emotional harm may consist of ulcers, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, or headaches.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award for emotional harm is warranted only if there is sufficient causal connection between the respondent's illegal actions and the complaining party's injury. <span class="Italic">See Gore v. Turner</span>, 563 F.2d 159, 164 (5th Cir. 1977). The discriminatory act or conduct must be the cause of the emotional harm. The claim of emotional harm will be seriously undermined if the onset of symptoms of emotional harm preceded the discrimination. However, if a complaining party had preexisting emotional difficulties and his mental health deteriorates as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the respondent. The fact that the complaining party may be unusually emotionally sensitive and incur great emotional harm from discriminatory conduct will not absolve the respondent from responsibility for the greater emotional harm<span class="Italic">. Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Company</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1294, 43 EPD &#x00B6; 37,178 (7th Cir. 1987) ("perhaps [plaintiff] was unusually sensitive, but a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them"). For example, suppose the Commission finds that the respondent is liable for sexual harassment against three female employees, one of whom is an incest victim. The incest victim incurred much greater emotional harm from the sexual harassment than did her two co-workers. The respondent is liable for the greater emotional harm that the incest victim suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For charges alleging emotional harm, consider factors that are directly relevant to whether and to what extent the employer caused the employee's emotional harm. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cowan v. Prudential Insurance <span id="Page_1826"></span>Co.</span>, 852 F.2d 688, 690-91, 47 EPD &#x00B6; 38,167 (2d Cir. 1988), the court found that defendant's failure to promote the plaintiff caused him severe emotional distress, humiliation, loss of self esteem, marital problems, and heavy drinking. However, the court considered several factors to determine whether and to what extent the emotional harm was caused by the defendant or by other factors. The factors considered were that: 1) the plaintiff had not been subjected to overt racism or public humiliation; 2) upper management was not aware that race was a factor in the failure to promote the plaintiff, who had been offered three other less attractive positions; 3) the plaintiff had caused some of the humiliation and difficulties that he had with his co-workers because he told clients that he would be promoted and he criticized his co-workers in a newspaper article; and 4) the plaintiff had not sought counseling. The court found that these factors justified a lower amount than the plaintiff sought. In <span class="Italic">Vance v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company</span>, 863 F.2d 1503, 1516, 48 EPD &#x00B6; 38,626 (11th Cir. 1989), the court found that an award of $500,000 in compensatory damages for mental distress, emotional harm, or humiliation resulting from racial discrimination was properly ruled excessive where there were other factors which probably contributed to the plaintiff's mental distress. The plaintiff had marital problems because her husband was named in a paternity suit by another woman, financial problems, problems resulting from an automobile accident, dietary problems, and family illnesses and deaths. Therefore, where a complaining party's emotional harm is due in part to personal difficulties, which were not caused or exacerbated by the discriminatory conduct, the employer is liable only for the harm resulting from the discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission will typically require medical evidence of emotional harm to seek damages for such harm in conciliation negotiations. However, evidence of emotional harm may be established by testimony. <span class="Italic">Gumby v. Pennsylvania Electric Company</span>, 840 F.2d 1108, 1121-22, 45 EPD &#x00B6; 37,785 (3d Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 492 U.S. 905, 50 EPD &#x00B6; 39,201 (1989); <span class="Italic">Cowan v. Prudential Insurance Co.</span>, 852 F.2d at 690-91. The "plaintiff's own testimony may be solely sufficient to establish humiliation or mental distress.' <span class="Italic">Williams v. TransWorld Airlines, Inc.</span>, 660 F.2d 1267, 1273, 27 EPD &#x00B6; 32,174 (8th Cir. 1981). For example, a plaintiff was awarded $52,644.80 in damages for mental anguish and emotional distress resulting from losing his house and car, marital harmony, and the respect of his children, after he was discriminatorily discharged. <span class="Italic">Muldrew v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.</span>, 728 F.2d 989, 33 EPD &#x00B6; 34,187 (8th Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Block v. R.H. Macy &#x0026; Co., Inc.</span>, 712 F.2d 1241, 1245, 32 EPD &#x00B6; 33,730 (8th Cir. 1983), the plaintiff was awarded $12,402 for "mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment and stress," $7,598 in backpay, and $60,000 in punitive damages. The evidence presented was that the supervisor openly manifested racial bias against Blacks by making racially offensive references to the plaintiff, another employee, and customers. On one occasion, the supervisor and plaintiff got into a dispute during which the supervisor berated the plaintiff in street language in front of coworkers and customers, although she never addressed White employees in this manner. The supervisor reported the dispute to management and told them that she wanted plaintiff "out of there." Management discharged the plaintiff without asking for her version of the incident, although they were well aware of the supervisor's racial bias. The plaintiff testified that she "cried and felt angry" with her supervisor after her discharge. Plaintiff further testified that she was unemployed for thirteen months and because of her financial dilemma, she suffered sleeplessness, anxiety, embarrassment, and depression. The jury found this evidence sufficient to award damages for mental distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Stallworth v. Shuler</span>, 777 F.2d 1431, 38 EPD &#x00B6; 35,806 (11th Cir. 1985), a case brought under &#x00A7; 1983 and &#x00A7; 1981, the court affirmed an award for $100,000 for humiliation and emotional distress. Over a period of years, the plaintiff was consistently passed over for administrative positions and principalships for racial reasons, while less qualified White persons were promoted. As a result, plaintiff suffered emotional stress, loss of sleep, marital strain, and humiliation. The defendant stated that there was no evidence that plaintiff missed work, received professional help, or slipped in his relationships with students or co-workers. Plaintiff countered that he was careful not to give the respondent a reason not to promote him. The court found that plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to award damages. However, for conciliation or settlement purposes, testimony solely by the complaining party may not be sufficient to establish emotional harm. There should be corroborating testimony by the complaining party's co-workers, supervisors, family, friends, or anyone else with knowledge of the emotional harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Damage awards for emotional harm vary significantly and there are no definitive rules governing the amounts to be awarded. However, compensatory damage awards must be limited to the sums necessary to compensate the plaintiff for actual harm, even if the harm is intangible<span class="Italic">. Carter v. Duncan-Huggins, Ltd</span>, 727 F.2d 1225, 33 EPD &#x00B6; 34,187 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Company</span>, 817 F.2d at 1293-95, the court upheld a damage award of $10,000 for the psychological disability of a nervous breakdown after the following sequence of events. Plaintiff was discriminated against for over a decade. She was assigned unskilled work, although she was qualified for, and occasionally performed, skilled work. Plaintiff was passed over for numerous promotions, in favor of less qualified White employees with less seniority. Plaintiff was also demoted to a lower status department despite her protests and the seniority rule in the collective bargaining agreement. Finally, on one occasion, the plaintiff used an upstairs bathroom, where she had been assigned a locker by the company, and was loudly berated in scatological terms by a supervisor for using this particular bathroom. The psychiatrist characterized the bathroom incident as the straw that broke the camel's back. The plaintiff was never able to return to work. In addition to the award for emotional harm, plaintiff received $130,000 for backpay and frontpay, $10,000 for medical and psychological expenses, and $100,000 for punitive damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In comparison, in another case, brought under &#x00A7; 1981, the plaintiff received $123,000 for emotional distress. The plaintiff had been under stress continuously for fear of making a mistake on the job, because he was discriminatorily denied proper training which he needed for adequate performance. The plaintiff's White coworkers, both senior and junior to the plaintiff, regularly received formal training. He was denied pay raises equivalent to those of his white co-workers because of his poor evaluations, which stressed the need for training. When the plaintiff finally received training after numerous requests, it was superficial in nature. Plaintiff's stressful situation resulted in high absenteeism and he was placed on probation. He filed a complaint and was subsequently discharged. Plaintiff's psychiatrist testified that the plaintiff was suffering from anxiety, stress, and depression. The court found that this was an adequate basis for the award. Plaintiff also received $176,000 in backpay, and $300,000 in punitive damages. <span class="Italic">Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch</span>, 832 F.2d 194, 44 EPD &#x00B6; 37,428 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The method for computing nonpecuniary damages during conciliation or settlement should typically be based on a consideration of the severity of harm and the time that the complaining party has suffered from the emotional harm. To determine the severity of the harm consider, for example, whether the harm consisted of occasional sleeplessness, or a nervous breakdown resulting in years of psychotherapy. The length of time that the complaining party has suffered from the emotional harm is also relevant. Of course, a complaining party who has suffered from severe depression for two months will be awarded less money than a complaining party who has suffered from severe depression for a year. However, different methods of computing damage amounts for emotional harm may be appropriate in certain cases. Since medical evidence is important, a medical release should be obtained from the complaining party whenever emotional or physical harm is alleged.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Melina K. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2021001468 (2022), the Commission distinguished the cases cited by the AJ to award $10,000 in compensatory damages and other more comparable cases that supported an increase to $175,000. <span class="italic">Melina K</span>. involved a nurse who was verbally and physically abused by a staff physician. The harassment lasted 18 months. The nurse was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Syndrome. She testified that "she had a lot of mental anguish, a 'shattered spirit,'" felted targeted and people turned their backs on her. The Commission found that the cases cited by the AJ did "not reflect the same nature or severity comparable" to <span class="italic">Melina K</span>.'s:</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Vena H</span>., <span class="italic">supra</span>, the complainant stated that she did not like to come to work anymore, her stomach hurt when she came to work, and she saw a doctor for anxiety and depression. She also felt as though she was forced to voluntarily retire due to the hostile work environment. The complainant was awarded $6,000 in compensatory damages. We find that this case is not comparable to the case at bar as Complainant was subject to a hostile work environment that involved physical assault and intimidation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Zounis</span>, <span class="italic">supra</span>, the complainant suffered emotional distress and psychological harm suffered from a sex based hostile work environment. However, we note that the exact nature and extent of the psychological harm suffered is not clear in the decision. Furthermore, we find that the AJ has not shown that the factors surrounding this case are in any way comparable to the matter at hand. As such, we find that the award in <span class="italic">Zounis</span> does not support the amount award by the AJ in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In EEOC Appeal No. 0120112818, the complainant was found to suffer harm caused by a hostile work environment due to the complainant's sex. In this case, the complainant was the initial aggressor, but after the initial altercation, due to the supervisor's height and weight, he became the aggressor. Again, we find that the facts of this case are not similar to the events at hand and do not support the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant experienced a hostile work environment beginning in 2014. For 18 months, Doctor 1 was verbally and physically aggressive with Complainant, yelling at Complainant and throwing a vital sign machine. She was the subject of racially derogatory comments directed at her, personally, in the form of comments about her hair and calling her a "monkey." This hostile work environment went unabated, <span id="Page_1827"></span>culminating in Doctor 1 physically assaulting Complainant, to include grabbing near her breasts, refusing to let her go even when Complainant repeatedly screamed for him to do so. After he released her, Doctor 1 returned to throw a computer on her desk. Even after the assault, the Agency continued to place her in a position to be within close proximity of Doctor 1 by leaving him on the floor with her for several days. Though Doctor 1 was removed from the floor, he was moved no more than a two to three-minute walk from Complainant and he continued to come to her work area until he was removed by Agency police. We also note that Doctor 1 was allowed to act with impunity for over a year. Even after Doctor 1 physically assaulted Complainant, the Agency did not take immediate action to remove Complainant from the sphere of influence of her harasser. As such, we find that following the assault, the Agency continued to expose Complainant to Doctor 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as to her mental state, the record includes multiple sources which state that, after the assault, Complainant immediately went from being friendly and a good worker to being quiet and non-communicative, to the point that it affected patient care. She felt like a target at work, like people turned their back on her. She had a lot of mental anguish and she was diagnosed with PTSD due to her experience. She sought therapy for her mental health condition through the Agency's EAP until the Agency required that she stop, at which point she continued counseling services through her bishop.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on the record and the Commission precedent, we find the AJ's award of $10,000 to be woefully insufficient. Instead, we conclude that an award of $175,000.00 would better compensate Complainant based on the egregiousness of the Doctor 1's actions (physical assault, racial comments, continued presence after the assault) from February 2014 to August 2015 and for the emotional and mental harm she suffered as a result of the actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this award is consistent with similar awards provided by the Commission. <span class="italic">See Lemons v. Dep't of Just</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120102416 (Nov. 16, 2011) (awarding $175,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where management failed to respond over a four to five-month period to complainant's four separate allegations that she was being sexually harassed by an inmate which culminated in a violent sexual assault resulting in her diagnosis of PTSD and Major Depression, suffering physical and emotional harm from the assault including insomnia, vomiting, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, an inability to trust people, and feelings of hopelessness and paranoia); <span class="italic">Stanton S., v. Dep't of Veteran Affs</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019005938 (Sept. 14, 2020) (modifying the Agency's award of $110,000 to $175,000, noting the harmful effects Complainant experienced following two physical workplace assaults one month apart); <span class="italic">Celinda L. v. Dep't of Veteran Affs</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2020002892 (Sept. 2, 2021) (increasing the award to $175,000 where Complainant was subjected to sexual harassment and a hostile work involvement, when, over the course of two months, she was shown graphic pictures, received threats of violence, and was choked by an Agency Employee); <span class="italic">Jackson v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110036 (Mar. 13, 2012) (the Commission affirmed an AJ's award of $125,000 for a complainant who was subjected to sex-based harassment by a supervisor that occurred over approximately 19 months, for emotional harm, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of self-esteem, injury to character and professional standing, marital strain, loss of health, sleep problems, anxiety, stress, depression, and humiliation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, upon review of the record as a whole, we find that Complainant is entitled to $175,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The Commission finds that this amount takes into account the severity and the duration of the harm suffered and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. We note that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="italic">See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (Apr. 15, 1999) (citing <span class="italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
