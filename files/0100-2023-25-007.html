<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-8"><span class="space">2.</span> Benefit Plans</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is not prohibited age discrimination when an employer, by adhering to the terms of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> employee benefit plan, treats older employees differently than younger counterparts. Budget reductions have put greater pressure on agencies to consolidate functions and eliminate positions. Both Congress and agencies have developed certain "incentives" designed to induce employees to voluntarily retire or resign from the federal government. One such policy forms the basis of an exception to a policy that would otherwise constitute discrimination on the basis of age.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dinerstein v. Postmaster General</span>, 01891589 (1989), the appellant declined a reassignment after his office closed and consolidated with another office. Instead, appellant opted for severance pay and a discontinued service annuity. However, pursuant to agency policy, employees who were eligible for immediate retirement benefits were not also eligible for severance pay. The Commission found that the policy in <span class="Italic">Dinerstein</span> was not discriminatory, in part because it effectuated the intent of Congress:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, examining appellant's complaint using the disparate treatment theory, we find that appellant (who retains the burden of persuasion throughout the adjudicative process <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981)) has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination. Because the record does not show that a younger person who was eligible for an annuity was provided severance pay, we do not find persuasive evidence that a similarly situated younger person was treated more favorably than appellant such that an inference of age discrimination is possible. (Citation omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, examining appellant's complaint under a disparate impact approach, while appellant has identified a specific policy, appellant has failed to provide persuasive statistical evidence showing a disparate impact. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nathan Plowden v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01863277 (July 30, 1987). Moreover, even if appellant had shown such statistics, we agree with the AJ that the agency has established business necessity by showing its requirement to carry out the intent of 5 USC Section 5595.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gettman v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01882552 (1988), the complainant, an employee who was eligible for immediate retirement benefits, was separated through reduction-in-force procedures. The complainant requested severance pay as is normally provided, but was denied severance pay on the basis that he <span id="Page_1441"></span>was eligible for a retirement annuity. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Gettman</span> alleged that denial of severance pay was age discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where denial of employment conditions or benefits is at issue, appellant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by demonstrating: (1) that he belongs to a statutorily protected class; (2) that his employment situation is comparable to those of employees outside of his protected class; and (3) he was denied conditions or benefits of employment afforded those employees. <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. Morris Brown College</span>, 752 F.2d 558, 562 n.7 (11th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Potter v. Goodwill Industries of Cleveland</span>, 518 F.2d 864, 865 (6th Cir. 1975). In the context of severance pay, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination is established by showing that such severance pay is conditioned upon nonretirement status and laid off workers are treated differently on the basis of age. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Westinghouse Electric Corp.</span>, 632 F. Supp. 343, 366 (E.D. Pa. 1986). Age is necessarily a determining factor, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a "but for" condition of eligibility for immediate retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Borden's, Inc.</span>, 724 F.2d 1390, 1393 (9th Cir. 1984). In his case, appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination, since denial of his request for severance pay was based on his eligibility for an immediate retirement annuity, which necessarily correlates with age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's articulated reason for denying appellant severance pay is that appellant was entitled to receive a retirement annuity and was not entitled to severance pay under federal law and regulations as outlined in the Federal Personnel Manual. We find that this reason is legitimate, nondiscriminatory and conclusively supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers are permitted to adhere to the terms of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> employee benefit plan. 29 USC 623(f)(2). In order to qualify, the challenged severance pay policy must meet the following criteria: (1) it must be part of an employee retirement, pension or insurance plan; (2) it must be <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, which means no more than that it exists and pays benefits; (3) the employer's denial of severance pay must be in observance of the plan; and (4) the plan must not be a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the ADEA. <span class="Italic">United States v. McMann</span>, 434 U.S. 192, 194 (1977); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Orange County</span>, 837 F.2d 420, 421 (9th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Karlen v. City College of Chicago</span>, 837 F.2d 314, 318 (7th Cir. 1988). In the private sector, severance pay plans such as the one at issue have been held in violation of the ADEA on the grounds that severance pay is a separate fringe benefit rather than a component of a comprehensive benefit plan<span class="Italic">. EEOC v. Westinghouse</span>, 725 F.2d 211, 223-5 (3d Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Curtis-Wright Corp.</span>, 34 EPD paragraph 34, 483 (D.N.J. 1982). In this case, had the severance pay at issue been authorized pursuant to an agency or OPM regulation, then it would fail to qualify as part of an employee benefit plan. However, because this plan is mandated by an act of Congress [5 USC 5595, 5 USC 8336(d)(1)] which had not been amended following enactment of the ADEA, we find that it is not in contravention thereof.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the moral of the case is that Congress giveth and Congress has the right to taketh away.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 29 CFR 1625.10(a)(1), an agency can offer lesser benefits to older workers under benefit plans provided the reason for doing so is the cost of the benefits. In an interesting case, a Department of State employee working in British Columbia, Canada, alleged age discrimination when her health insurance benefits were terminated at age 65. The province had a law requiring mandatory retirement at 65. The law was repealed, but the complainant's benefits were terminated under the terms of health benefit policy. In finding age discrimination in <span class="Italic">Eng v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120103589 (2012), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency witnesses in this case have explained that its contract with its insurance provider that provided for the automatic termination of health insurance benefits to employees age 65 or older was a result of British Columbia's statute which allowed employers to have mandatory retirement systems for employees age 65 or older. However, the Agency concedes that it did not have a mandatory retirement requirement in place for its employees, and that Complainant's employment continued beyond her 65th birthday. In fact, the Agency notified its employees, including Complainant, in April 2008 that it was renegotiating its contract with its insurance provider and that coverage would continue during this period. However, the record establishes that Complainant's coverage was, in fact, terminated as of July 29, 2008, seven months after British Columbia's mandatory retirement law was repealed, and was not reinstated until May 2009, when a new insurance contract was finally implemented between the Agency and GW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency explained that Complainant did not have insurance because they were in the process of negotiating revised terms with GW and, due to administrative "red tape," these new terms did not go into effect until May 15, 2009. Given the record evidence, we do not accept administrative "red tape" as a legitimate reason for declining to extend supplemental health insurance in this case. The evidentiary record shows that, as early as 2006, the Agency human resources officials were fully aware that British Columbia was in the process of repealing its mandatory retirement age statute. However, Agency witnesses state they did not start the internal process of revising the terms of the health insurance contract until January 1, 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, our regulations permit age-based reductions in employee benefit plans, only where cost is a consideration. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.10(a)(1). Accordingly, a "benefit plan will be considered in compliance with the [ADEA] where the actual amount of payment made, or cost incurred, in behalf of an older worker is equal to that made or incurred in behalf of a younger worker, even though the older worker may thereby receive a lesser amount of benefits or insurance coverage." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is a narrow exception and the Agency shoulders the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that its benefit plan meets the requirements of &#x00A7; 1625.10. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency sets forth no such argument. The Agency solely relies upon the explanation provided by its Regional Human Resources Officer that administrative "red tape" prevented it from following through on its April 8, 2008 promise to extend health insurance coverage to employees 65 years of age or older. This "red tape" argument fails to satisfy the Agency's obligations under &#x00A7; 1625.10. Furthermore, the Agency has presented no reason why it could not have obtained temporary coverage to ensure Complainant was properly covered until the Agency's contract with GW could be properly revised. The Agency also fails to explain why it did not provide notice to its employees, as promised in the April 8, 2008, memorandum, that coverage would not be extended. Ultimately, the Agency did not attempt to articulate whether temporary coverage or some other solution was economically infeasible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency failed to carry its burden of proving a legitimate defense to its age-based health insurance system, we find the Agency discriminated against Complainant when it failed to extend her insurance coverage beyond her 65th birthday.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has, in several cases, found that Congress has created exceptions to the ADEA. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wesley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0120100713 (2012), the Commission rejected a challenge to an optional life insurance premium based on age:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ found that Complainant failed to state a claim because Congress created an exemption to the ADEA in the statute that governs FEGLI's additional optional insurance. Complainant asserts that OPM violated the ADEA when it made him and other older workers pay a higher insurance premium than younger workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the statute governing additional optional life insurance under FEGLI, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8714b(e), Congress stated that "[t]he cost of the additional optional insurance shall be determined from time to time by [OPM] on the basis of the employee's age relative to such age groups as [established by OPM]." The AJ found that this constituted a Congressional exemption of the FEGLI premium determinations at issues from ADEA coverage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has addressed similar cases where Congress has created an exception to the ordinary prohibition against age-based determinations under the ADEA. For example, in <span class="Italic">Diluglio v. Dep't. of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930890 (Aug. 22, 1994), the Commission found that when Congress stated in a statute that an agency may make determinations fixing the age limits for appointment for law enforcement officers, Congress created a special age entry rule which was an exception to the prohibition against age-based determinations under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See also Campbell v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960550 (April 19, 1997) (The Commission upheld its previous position that Congress created a statutory exception to the ADEA when it stated that an Agency may determine and fix the minimum and maximum age for appointment to a law enforcement officer position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Brumbaugh v. Dep't. or Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A05531 (March 29, 2001), the Commission found that it may generally recognize statutorily created exceptions to the ADEA in federal sector employment age discrimination cases. In that case, the Commission found that unless there is a clear statement of Congressional intent to the contrary, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general statute, particularly when the specific statute was enacted after the general statute. Additionally, the Commission cited to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Chevron Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), and noted that in decisions of this kind, Agencies are to be afforded a very high degree of deference when it comes to interpreting their own laws and regulations. As a result, the Commission found that Congress created a statutory exception to the ADEA when it permitted the Agency to implement mandatory separations of non-dual status military technicians who are eligible for unreduced retirement annuities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case before us is very similar to the previous decisions where the Commission has concluded that Congress created an exception to the ADEA. Here, the statute governing additional optional life insurance under FEGLI, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8714b, specifically states that OPM may establish the cost of the additional optional insurance on the basis of the employee's age. &#x00A7; 8714b(e). Therefore, Congress created a statutory exception to the ADEA when it permitted OPM to make an age-based determination. Further, because Congress enacted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8714b (a specific statute) after the ADEA (a general statute), with full knowledge of the provisions of both statutes, we must conclude that Congress intended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8714b(e) to <span id="Page_1442"></span>create an exception to the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See Brumbaugh, supra</span>. Finally, we must give OPM a high degree of deference when it comes to interpreting their regulations. <span class="Italic">Chevron, supra</span>. As a result, Complainant's allegation that he was discriminated against on the basis of age when he was charged a higher premium for his FEGLI Option B insurance fails to state a claim, and the complaint was properly dismissed pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1).</p>
