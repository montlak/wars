<p class="noindent">"[A]n Agency's reasons for an [adverse] action may not be legitimate if the reasons are based on conduct that has resulted from the agency's failure to promptly and effectively correct harassment." <span class="Italic">Jason L. v. Attorney General</span>, 2022000528 (2022). When an employee is harassed or subjected to a hostile work environment and the agency ignores those claims or is ineffective in its attempts to stop the harassment, it is foreseeable that the victim may act out in defense or upset. In those cases, the victim's reactions may be the "natural, foreseeable, and to-be-expected consequence of management's inaction to severe and pervasive harassment by coworkers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That happened in <span id="Page_1528"></span>several cases where the agency punished the victims for their reactions to the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jason L. v. Attorney General</span>, 2022000528 (2022), the complainant notified management that, among other things, a coworker harassed him based on his sexual orientation. Thereafter, the agency transferred the complainant and changed his work schedule, citing to an altercation between the complainant and the harassing coworker in which the complainant was the aggressor. The AJ in <span class="Italic">Jason L.</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant proved that the Agency subjected him to discrimination on the bases of race, sex, disability, and reprisal. The AJ also determined that Complainant was subjected to harassment due to constant offensive comments about his sexual orientation, including when a coworker revealed that Complainant was gay, or "outed" him in the workplace. In addition, the AJ found that other coworkers created a hostile work environment due to ongoing derogatory remarks about gay men and anyone else not conforming to their views and beliefs related to heterosexual masculine man, such as transgender individuals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also determined that the Agency was notified of the offensive and derogatory conduct, but did not take prompt and adequate corrective action because it did not: conduct a prompt investigation, thoroughly and completely investigate all the allegations, take action to end all the harassment alleged, and promptly separate the victim and any harassers. Finally, the AJ determined that the Agency was liable for retaliation for changing Complainant's shift after being on the same shift for years and making his return to his regular shift to be contingent upon resolving his issues with one of his harassers.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Jason L</span>. rejected the retaliation, defending its actions based on the verbal altercation between the complainant and his harasser and complainant's refusal to continue to work with the harasser. The complainant appealed alleging that the agency's reasons were pretext for retaliation. The Commission agreed. Citing to several similar cases, the Commission wrote in <span class="Italic">Jason L</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency has provided that Complainant's schedule was adjusted because Complainant was the "aggressor" in a verbal altercation with the coworker (Coworker) who was harassing him on September 2, 2016. The Agency indicated that Complainant declined alternative dispute resolution with Coworker and that Complainant had less seniority at the Agency than Coworker. In an attempt to allow Complainant to keep his schedule, Complainant was told by Supervisor 2 to "put it behind him and remain professional" and continue to work with Coworker. Supervisor 2 wanted Complainant and Coworker to "make things normal, get along, do their eight-hour shift, and then go home." Therefore, the Agency provided that it was Complainant's refusal to cooperate (continue working with his harasser) which ultimately resulted in his schedule change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the AJ, an Agency's reasons for an action may not be legitimate if the reasons are based on conduct that has resulted from the agency's failure to promptly and effectively correct harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Phyllis v. Transp. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120150799 (Feb. 16, 2021), for example, the termination of a complainant for "present[ing] a security risk" at an airport checkpoint by "walk[ing] off the job" was deemed unlawful because the complainant left her post to get away from a harassing coworker. In that case, complainant reported this coworker's anti-gay and retaliatory conduct to multiple management officials in the months prior to the incident. However, management overlooked "credible [evidentiary] support" for complainant's allegations and viewed complainant--not her coworker--as the "source of the problem."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Phyllis</span> said that the agency's reasons for the termination were pretext for retaliation because the agency's failure to stop the harassment led to an "intolerable working environment" where "[c]omplainant felt unsafe, had pursued all available avenues to avoid the harassment, and found no other option but to leave...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission can still find liability where a complainant's conduct in response to harassment involves aggressiveness or threatening behavior. For example, in <span class="Italic">Crawford v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070020 (Mar. 5, 2010), for example, the relocation of a complainant to another building "reek[ed] of reprisal," where the complainant yelled, "Leave me alone, bitch," to a coworker whose harassing conduct had been the subject of complainant's reports to management over a period of months. The Commission characterized this as a "classic instance of blaming the victim." Liability was also found in <span class="Italic">Talabi v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01965276 (Apr. 6, 1998), where the agency terminated a complainant for his "disruptive and threatening" behavior toward a coworker, where the behavior was "the natural, foreseeable, and to-be-expected, consequence of management's inaction" to severe and pervasive harassment by coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yet, like the agencies in <span class="Italic">Phyllis</span>, <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, and <span class="Italic">Talabi</span>, the Agency in the instant case blamed the victim of ongoing harassment as being the source of the problem. On appeal, the Agency continues to blame Complainant, and argues that he was inappropriate and unprofessional, while concurrently taking no issue with the AJ's finding that Complainant was in fact subject to harassment by Coworker (and others). The Agency has taken the position that management was "reacting appropriately to an escalating interpersonal conflict." <span class="Italic">See</span> Agency's Response to Complainant's OFO Brief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ and find that Complainant's reactions to Coworker were "natural, foreseeable, and to-be-expected consequence of management's inaction to severe and pervasive harassment by coworkers." As such, in summary, we find that the Agency has failed to show that their reasons for altering Complainant's shift were not pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has met his burden of establishing that the Agency's reasons for the mail room reassignment and shift change are pretext for reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Jason L. </span>upheld an award of $200,000 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Phyllis F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120150799 (2021), the complainant repeatedly complained of harassment based on her sexual orientation over the course of months. During this time, management sent an email advising employees to be respectful of each other and held "daily shift briefings on hostile work environments" but did not discuss "preventative or corrective actions." Despite repeated escalations to management, the complainant's concerns were not directly addressed for six months, during which time the harassment continued. One day, she left work during her shift and informed her supervisor that she did not feel comfortable working with the harasser. The supervisor told her that she did not have to work with the harasser again and told her to come back to work. When she returned to work, she discovered that the harasser was still there and left. The supervisor told her to return immediately to work and called her a "baby." She returned to work but was charged for being AWOL and subsequently terminated because "management had lost confidence in her ability to perform the job and because she presented a security risk when she left her post." The Commission had little trouble finding that the agency's failure to protect the complainant from harassment led to her decision to leave work and the subsequent termination <span class="Italic">Phyllis F</span>. was retaliatory:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The most troubling piece of this record is management's utter disregard of its responsibilities to appropriately address the co-worker harassment. The record reveals Complainant complained to her first-level supervisor (STSO) in March, her second-level supervisor (TSM) in April and then to her third-level supervisor (AFSD) in August 2013. At each stage, management's responses were inadequate. STSO spoke with TSO1 in a public place, which was not an effective or appropriate remedial measure. TSM did not provide immediate action because he conducted an investigation in July 2013, months after the initial incidents occurred. By this time, however, TSM said that he found insufficient corroboration. There is no information in the record as to the reason for this delayed investigation, and upon review, we find this inquiry did in fact reveal credible support for Complainant's claim that she was subjected to harassment. ROI at 392, 590.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While management may have spoken to the TSOs about their inappropriate conduct, their action failed to end the harassment. Rather, retaliation from co-workers, and ultimately from management, continued unaddressed. The record reveals that management identified Complainant's behaviors as the source of the problem, rather than the conduct of her coworkers. The failure of the local management to deal with the harassment was so evident that even AFSD acknowledged in an email to TSM on August 16, 2013, that he was not responding to the situation appropriately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant presented the following email from AFSD to TSM:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I read over the file here at RDU regarding [Complainant's] complaint. However, I did not see anything related to your final resolution. Also, I would hope that [TSO1] was issued at least a LOC for her inappropriate comments to [Complainant]. In her written statement, she admits to making the statements reference to gay marriage, not having a man and the dog. [TSO1's] statements are totally inappropriate and should have been addressed in writing, not verbally as it appears.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Question: did you respond to [Complainant] in writing?</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">See</span> Complainant's Appeal Brief at Exhibit 1.5</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was not until August 22, 2013, soon after this email, that TSM finally sent Complainant the results of her March 2013 allegations. After a review of the record, we find the Agency is liable for the harassment because it failed to take immediate and appropriate remedial actions to end the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is under an obligation to do "whatever is necessary" to end harassment, to make a victim whole, and to prevent the misconduct from recurring. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091345 (February 1, 2012); <span class="Italic">see also Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious <span id="Page_1529"></span>Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, supra</span> (stating that "remedial measures should be designed to stop the harassment, correct its effects on the employee, and ensure that the harassment does not recur"). Taking only a stop-gap remedial action does not absolve the Agency of liability where that action is ineffective. <span class="Italic">See Logsdon v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40120 (Feb. 28, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency could not separate the individuals due to the nature of the facility, it should have disciplined or transferred TSO1. Furthermore, Complainant repeatedly requested a transfer to escape the harassment, but this request was repeatedly denied because the CBA allegedly prohibited such a transfer. While we are skeptical that this explanation would suffice under the circumstances, we are unable to examine the CBA because it was not placed into the record. We also note the absence of any sexual harassment policy from the record, which further supports our finding that the Agency failed to establish that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action after it learned of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the entire record, Complainant established that the Agency's reasons for its performance rating and termination were a pretext to retaliate against her. Complainant alleged that she performed higher than her rating revealed, and when she challenged the rating, management changed it. With respect to the termination, the record does not contain documentary evidence of Complainant's comings and goings on the day in question, and there is conflicting evidence in the record as to how long Complainant was absent from the facility. Our review of the evidence reveals that TSM authorized Complainant's absence from the facility for two hours after the first incident occurred, since by that time TSO1's shift would have ended. ROI at 595, 1030. The second incident seemed to last no more than 30 minutes and occurred soon after Complainant's return to work around 4:00 P.M. Accordingly, we find insufficient evidence in the record which supports the Agency's finding that Complainant was AWOL for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Fellow TSOs corroborated Complainant's account that that other TSOs were absent from their positions on occasion but not similarly disciplined. ROI at 551.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, we find that Complainant established the Agency's reason for issuing the termination was a pretext to retaliate against her. Notably, the undisputed reason Complainant left the facility was because the Agency failed to stop the harassment from TSO1. The record convinces us that Complainant felt unsafe, had pursued all available avenues to avoid the harassment, and found no other option but to leave and see her physician. Therefore, we find that Complainant's first excused absence, and subsequent shorter absence on October 23, 2013, were not legitimate reasons to terminate her employment, considering evidence that others were not similarly treated, as well as the Agency's failure to cure the ongoing harassment, which created an intolerable working environment. Accordingly, we find Complainant's termination was a pretext to retaliate against her for engaging in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070020 (2010), upheld the AJ's conclusion that the case was "a classic example of management blaming the victim" where, after complaining of a sexually charged hostile work environment, the complainant was transferred to another building. The agency alleged that the transfer was in response to the complainant's outburst at her alleged harasser. The Commission found that the agency's actions "reek[ed] of reprisal."</p>
