<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-37"><span class="space">5.</span> Interviews</h4>
<p class="noindent">Interviews, by their very nature, inject an element of subjectivity into a selection process. The Commission acknowledges that interviews can be particularly subjective when used to rate "potential" in a job. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Weinstein v. USPS</span>, 01821779 (1983). Subjective factors alone do not make a selection discriminatory. The complainant also must show the selecting official was improperly motivated. It is still the agency's burden, however, to provide a "specific, clear, and individualized explanation for a nonselection so that the complainant is provided with an opportunity to prove that the agency's explanation was pretext for discriminatory animus." <span class="Italic">Alline B. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120162182 (2017). Where interviews are concerned, it is not enough for the agency to simply cite an interview score with no supporting detail. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Alline B.</span> where the 57-year-old complainant alleged age discrimination when she was not selected for a position that was filled with a 27, 28, and 41-year-old. The agency defended its nonselection of complainant by noting that the complainant only received 20 out of a possible 40 points for her interview. This fell short of the agency's burden, according to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Alline B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency now has the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for not selecting Complainant. Selecting officials stated that they did not select Complainant because she only received 20 out of 40 points for her interview, and the selectees were more qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the Agency's assertion of this reason in this case does not meet its burden of production.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, selecting officials stated that Complainant was not selected because other candidates demonstrated stronger knowledge, skills, and abilities for the vacant position. However, this too is a vague and conclusory explanation akin to merely asserting that other candidates were "better qualified" than Complainant. This asserted reason is so vaporous that it deprives Complainant of any meaningful opportunity to rebut it. <span class="Italic">See also EEOC v. Target Corp</span>., 460 F.3d 946, 959 (7th Cir. 2006) (employer should have articulated qualities applicant failed to meet in order to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason so applicant would know what evidence to present to establish pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Branch Manager and Deputy Branch Manager suggested that Complainant was not selected because she only received 20 out of 40 points for her interview. We note that this claim is contradicted by the Director and Deputy Director, who asserted that a scoring or rating system was not used in the selection process. At any rate, even if applicants were rated or scored, the Agency did not explain why it assigned Complainant such a score, nor did it provide the investigator with or any documentation revealing the reasoning and justification behind Complainant's purported score. We have held that an agency does not meet its burden of production when it merely states that a complainant was not selected because he received lower scores from selecting officials than the selectee, without explaining the specific reasoning for the scores. <span class="Italic">See Bakken v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120093529 (Aug. 8, 2011) (age discrimination found where Agency did not meet burden of production by merely stating that Complainant was not selected because he received a lower score than most of the selectees but did not provide the assessments, bases, or factors behind its decisions); <span class="Italic">Myles v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120092511 (Feb. 10, 2011) (Agency failed to meet burden of production when it merely said that Complainant was not selected because Review Panel ranked him lower in scoring because this was not a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for Complainant's non-selection); <span class="Italic">Glomski v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01955157 (July 17, 1997) (Agency failed to meet its burden of production because it did not provide an explanation of the review committee's assignment of scores to Complainant and the selectee). Additionally, we note that the Agency inexplicably did not provide any information about the scores or points received by the selectees. As such, the assertion that Complainant received 20 points for her interview is utterly meaningless and without context. Therefore, the Agency's claim that Complainant's nonselection was based on her score also does not meet the Agency's burden of production.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Agency failed to articulate a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for Complainant's non-selection, and consequently, Complainant was denied a fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520070124 (Nov. 14, 2011); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A32050 (Jan. 7, 2005), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A50685 (Apr. 26, 2005); <span class="Italic">Fullman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 01A31036 (Mar. 18, 2004). Thus, the Agency failed to rebut the inference of discrimination created when Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Therefore, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant based on her age when it did not select her for a GS-9 Supervisory Customer Service Technician position.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not discriminatory for members of a selection panel to consider the employee's conduct during an interview. The agency offered a legitimate reason for its selection of a male promotional candidate when it offered evidence that the complainant attempted to answer questions before they were completed, lectured the selection panel in her answers, and that the selectee had demonstrated strong communication abilities<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Kurtz v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01822116 (1983). Likewise, the failure of the selection panel to rescore the complainant's resume on the basis of experience did not evidence discrimination, where the selecting official had reviewed the results and determined that offsetting errors by the panel had resulted in the same score the employee would have received had her experience been assessed correctly.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not a demonstration of pretext where the selecting official interviewed outside candidates from the OPM register, but did not interview internal candidates. <span class="Italic">See Atkins v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01831893 (1984). The selecting official testified that he was familiar with the performance of all internal applicants. Nor is it necessary for the selecting official to interview all candidates. <span class="Italic">See Potter v. USPS</span>, 01830319 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not unusual for a selecting official to assert that the nonselected employee demonstrated an "attitude problem" during the interview process that made a similarly qualified candidate more attractive for the position at issue. Consideration of employees' attitudes is not prohibited by Title VII. However, because of the extremely subjective nature of attitude assessments, the Commission treats such assessments as inherently suspect and generally will subject them to a high degree of scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grandison v. USPS</span>, 01831136 (1985). Where an agency uses subjective selection criteria, they must be articulated with sufficient particularity to sustain the agency's burden of production. When the characterization of the complainant's interview performance is so vague that it does not permit the complainant an opportunity to demonstrate pretext, the agency has failed to carry its burden of production. <span class="Italic">See Swift v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975658 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">Along with "attitude problems" comes the problem of "image"--namely, the appearance an employee presents to coworkers, supervisors and members of the general public. Consideration of "image" is permissible, provided the factors that make up the assessment of "image" are not discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See Tracy v. Department of Navy</span>, 01852472 (1987). In that case, the selecting officials testified that the complainant's negative attitude about herself, her appearance, her mannerisms, and her inflexibility were incompatible with a secretarial position that involved extensive contact with clients and the public. The Commission found that none of those criteria were based on age as alleged by the complainant, but were legitimate factors to consider given the requirements of the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Great latitude is given in the selection of candidates for management positions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Harrell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A55156 (2006), the Commission found the agency demonstrated its selections were not based on age discrimination where the complainant was not selected because of his interview and management style:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While complainant had substantially more diverse work and more supervisory experience than S2, the position required more than experience. Each applicant was required to interview, and a panel was convened to rate the applicants' interviews. The SO also rated the candidates' resumes and supervisory experience. S2 met the minimal requirements for the position in question by having served for at least a year in a GS-13 management position. In addition, he had a higher total score than complainant (76 versus 70). Complainant failed to rebut the panel's unanimous contention that he rambled during the interview. Further, complainant failed to rebut the SO's statement that he did not demonstrate the same level of leadership and management skills in his resume or interview as the two selectees and his management style was finger-pointing and confrontational.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1574"></span>While the AJ in this matter found that complainant was "plainly superior" to S2, she also concluded that complainant failed to meet his burden to prove that age-based animus motivated the agency's action. After considering all the skills, abilities and experience that were sought in the successful candidate, we find that substantial evidence does not support the AJ's conclusion that complainant was plainly superior to S2. This conclusion, combined with the fact that substantial evidence does support the AJ's finding that there was insufficient evidence of age-based animus, leads us to the conclusion that complainant did not establish that the agency's articulated reasons for either selection were pretext for age discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The vacancies at issue herein were for management positions. We have repeatedly recognized that the agency has broad discretion to set policies and carry out personnel decisions, and should not be second-guessed by the reviewing authority absent evidence of unlawful motivation. <span class="Italic">See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 259 (1981). We simply do not have the authority nor the capacity to stand as the super-personnel department for the Department of the Navy. Of course, personnel decisions which are idiosyncratic or suspect are subjected to heightened scrutiny.<span class="Italic"> See Andre v. Dep't of Defense, EEOC</span> Appeal No. 01994562 (Feb. 22, 2002). Deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification are sufficient to support an inference of pretext. <span class="Italic">See Hovey v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973965, (Aug. 31, 2000). However, we find no evidence of an idiosyncratic decision in not selecting complainant. Therefore, after a careful review of the record, including arguments and evidence not specifically addressed in this decision, we affirm the agency's final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">On occasion, interviews may be conducted via telephone. In these instances, the appellant may run into a problem establishing that the selecting official was aware of her protected status. <span class="Italic">See Price v. EEOC</span>, 01790054 (1982) (there was no evidence that the selecting official was aware of the appellant's race).</p>
<p class="noindent">Questions asked during job interviews can provide evidence with regard to selection motivation. For example, questions about whether a prospective employee can work for a female supervisor can be indicative of sex discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Jarrett v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01860741 (1987); 29 CFR 1604.7. But such a question is not discriminatory when it is asked of both male and female applicants and the motivation is to ascertain the preferences of the candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complainant's supervisor, who is also the RMO, is a member of the interview panel and does not reveal that complainant has some 18 years more experience than the selectee, this can be evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892387 (1989). The Commission found that the complainant's supervisor knew the explanation on her SF-171 was inadequate and should have corrected the panel's impression that the selectee had better qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency articulates as a legitimate reason for its selection the relative performances of the selectee and the complainant at the interview, it should be prepared to present evidence on the specifics of the interview. Although technically it is always the complainant who bears the burden of proof, the inability to be specific about interview performance can be viewed as evidence of pretext. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roach v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01952452 (1996). A good example of this principal is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120120836 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant must now show that the reasons provided by the Agency (or attested to by S1) were a pretext for discrimination. The Agency's main reason for Complainant's nonselection appears to be that Selectee 1 performed better than Complainant during the interview. Yet, the Agency was unable to produce interview notes. For her part, Complainant highlighted evidence showing that the Agency's Human Resources Office rated her more qualified than Selectee 1 (by almost 10 percentage points) for the position at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Information obtained from the ROI indicates that two of the four persons on the interview panel for the position expressed concern that prior EEO activity may be a factor in Agency decisions. One of those individuals also stated that she heard or observed instances she believed was retaliatory; the other stated he believed there was a cloud over the Agency regarding age discrimination. A third expressed ambivalence. Only S1, the sole selecting official and also a member of the interview panel, stated categorically that Complainant's sex, age, or prior EEO activity was not a factor in his decision to select someone other than Complainant for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on documentary and testimonial evidence contained in the ROI, we find that Complainant has met her burden to show that it is more likely than not that her nonselection was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent">The subjective nature of the interview process can help support a finding of pretext, particularly where the complainant is black and all members of the interview panel are white, the complainant has superior qualifications, and the notes of the interview show the complainant performed well on the interview. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01961336 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an interview is not a required part of the selection process, the failure to conduct interviews is not indicative of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Complainant v, Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123109 (2015) ("We find no evidence that SO was required to conduct interviews and that her failure to do so indicates the selection process was less than genuine.").</p>
