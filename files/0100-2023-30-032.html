<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-33"><span class="space">e.</span> Premium Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">When a discriminatory shift change results directly in the loss of out-of-schedule premium pay, then such a premium should be part of the make-whole remedy. In approving such a remedy in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930789 (1994), the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision, <span class="Italic">David L. Cornelius v. Marvin T. Runyon, Jr., Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924642 (April 27, 1993), contains a thorough and extensive description of the background facts in this matter. In light of this, we will not repeat the previous decision's narrative. Instead, we note the following salient facts. Appellant had worked for the agency as Custodian on Tour III (3:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> to midnight) since 1986. It is undisputed that appellant was a good worker and successfully performed his job. At the time this dispute arose, the agency had curtailed the number of employees working the third tour and advised appellant he would soon be working Tour II (6:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 3:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>). Appellant submitted a letter from his physician, recommending that appellant "be allowed to make such a transition gradually" as a result of his epilepsy. Gross alterations in sleep cycles could pose an increased risk of seizures, according to appellant's doctor. In spite of this letter, appellant was abruptly shifted to Tour II duty on January 31, 1990. After working several weeks, appellant took annual leave from February 24, 1990 to March 6, 1990. On March 7, 1990, the date appellant returned to work, he had a seizure. Appellant was out of work as a result from that date until March 11, 1990 and for the period from March 16, 1990 to March 28, 1990. Subsequently, appellant bid on and was rescheduled to Tour III duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision made a finding of discrimination based on the agency's failure to accommodate appellant's disability (epilepsy) by providing him with a less abrupt shift change. The previous decision ordered the agency to provide the following remedial action:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency shall provide appellant backpay, if appropriate, in the amount of any payments he would have received had he remained on the night shift during the period he was assigned to Tour II. This shall not include reimbursement for leave taken by appellant from January 13, 1990 until January 27, 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1720"></span><span class="Italic">David L. Cornelius v. Marvin T. Runyon, Jr., Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924642, at 9 (April 27, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his request, appellant asks "whether it was the intention of the Commission to exclude his recovery of out-of-schedule pay for the time he worked on Tour II as a result of the discriminatory act." Appellant argues that, under his collective bargaining agreement, he is entitled to overtime (time-and-a-half pay) for time worked outside his regularly scheduled work week. According to appellant's argument, since he was forced to work outside his regular schedule by working Tour II, he is entitled to be compensated for that time at the overtime rate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We observe that the intent of the Order at issue was to reimburse appellant for the time he was out of work as a result of his seizure on March 7, 1990: March 7, 1990 to March 11, 1990 and March 16, 1990 to March 28, 1990. Appellant is likewise entitled to out-of-schedule pay for the hours he worked on Tour II when he should have been scheduled for Tour III. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fagone v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930026 (June 4, 1993). Appellant is entitled to be put in the position he would have been in absent the discriminatory action taken by the agency, that is, the agency's failure to change his work schedule from Tour III to Tour II in the manner requested for his medical condition. When computing his relief in this matter, the agency shall take the out-of-schedule pay factor into account. In addition, the agency shall take the appropriate action as specified by the compliance paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, when the discrimination results in the complainant being required to work out of schedule, he is entitled to out-of-schedule pay as part of his remedy. <span class="Italic">See Gallagher v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963425 (2001) (make-whole relief includes out of schedule pay); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Espinosa v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960098 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Premium pay calculations should include holiday pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carney v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 04970018 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant is discriminatorily denied a promotion for a position that requires a different work schedule, he is not entitled to have his back pay award enhanced by out-of-schedule pay on the theory that the hours would have been different from those he actually worked. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 04970011 (1999), ruled that the complainant was entitled to the same number of hours in back pay as the employee who held the position to which the complainant was retroactively promoted, at the appropriate pay step. The complainant was not entitled to the out-of-schedule pay level requested, because he would not have been entitled to such pay if he had been properly promoted. The Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioner does not explain why he believes he is entitled to out of schedule premium pay for the whole period Employee R was in the position in question. We infer that the petitioner makes this claim because, measured from the perspective of his prior jobs, Employee R's schedule was mostly "out of schedule" for the petitioner. Such an argument is unpersuasive. Had the petitioner been selected for promotion to Electronics Technician, PS-10 effective June 13, 1992, his regular work hours would not be "out of schedule." As indicated in <span class="Italic">Allen, supra</span>, a victim of discrimination should earn the backpay he would have earned had he worked in the position he was denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An argument similar to the one the petitioner makes was rejected in <span class="Italic">White v. United States Postal Service</span>, 931 F.2d 1540, 1541-42 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In <span class="Italic">White</span>, the court noted that the agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual provided that out of schedule overtime pay was available to "eligible full-time bargaining unit employees for time worked outside of, and instead of, their regularly scheduled workday or workweek when employees work on a temporary schedule at the request of management." It found that because the complainant's different schedule was not temporary after she was improperly demoted, she was not entitled to out of schedule overtime pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bernhardt v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A10285 (2002), the Commission applied the principle to a reasonable accommodation case. In the oriGINAl decision in <span class="Italic">Bernhardt</span>, the Commission awarded the complainant premium pay on the theory that if the agency had accommodated the complainant, she would not have been working the shift that she worked in the interim. However, on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Bernhardt</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On request for reconsideration, the agency does not contest the finding of discrimination. The agency argues, however, that the previous decision erred in awarding complainant out of schedule pay. The agency notes that, while complainant was working a schedule other than the one she desired after she was denied placement into the bid position, she was in fact working her regular assigned schedule. The agency argues that awarding complainant out of schedule pay, rather than making her whole, would actually place complainant in a better position than she would have enjoyed in the absence of discrimination. More specifically, if complainant had not been denied the bid position, she would have received only her regular pay, not premium pay. Finally, the agency draws the Commission's attention to the decision in <span class="Italic">Sansosti v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04990004 (June 17, 1999). Complainant did not reply to the agency's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Sansosti v. United States Postal Service,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission held that an award of out of schedule pay was not appropriate make-whole relief where the affected employee was not made to work outside of his regular assigned schedule, notwithstanding that the employee was deprived of his desired schedule on account of unlawful discrimination. The Commission finds this principle applicable to the case at bar. If complainant had not been denied placement into the bid position, she would have been paid only for working her regular assigned schedule, not the out of schedule premium. Accordingly, to award complainant out of schedule pay would be to place her in a better position than she would have occupied absent discrimination, and the previous decision erred in so doing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the agency's request for reconsideration, the previous decision, and the entire record, the Commission finds that the agency's request meets the criteria of 29 CFR 1614.405(b), and it is the decision of the Commission to GRANT the agency's request. The decision of the Commission in Appeal No. 01963425 is MODIFIED to reflect that complainant is not entitled to out of schedule pay as a remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Besemer v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/04A40013.txt">04A40013</a> (2004), the Commission rejected a similar argument for out-of-schedule pay on the basis such an award would place a complainant in better position than he or she would have been in but for the discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner also claims that he is entitled to "out-of-schedule pay." Out-of-schedule pay is a form of premium pay due to employees who are required to work outside of their regularly assigned schedule. <span class="Italic">See Arnold v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A20087 (June 25, 2003); <span class="Italic">Sansosti v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04990004 (June 17, 1999). Petitioner does not allege that he was made to work a schedule other than his regularly assigned schedule or that he missed the opportunity to work out-of-schedule because he was reassigned to a different work location. Rather, petitioner claims that he is entitled to "out-of-schedule pay" because the schedule which he was assigned, and which he worked, was not the schedule to which he should have been assigned. Relief under the Rehabilitation Act is limited to the restoration of lost benefits of employment which would have been earned or accrued absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 422 U.S. 405 (1975). Since the evidence does not support the finding that petitioner would have earned "out-of-schedule pay" had he been allowed to remain in his oriGINAl assigned position, payment of the sums sought would place him in a far better position than he would have been absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Bernhardt v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A10285 (February 1, 2002); <span class="Italic">Sansosti v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04990004 (June 17, 1999)<span class="Italic">; Alford v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901179 (December 31, 1990). Accordingly, we find that petitioner is not entitled to out-of-schedule pay.</p>
