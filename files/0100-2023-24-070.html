<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-53"><span class="space">2.</span> Pretreatment Offenses</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not hold pretreatment alcohol-induced offenses against an employee and combine them with post-treatment offenses to enhance discipline. In <span class="Italic">Mangrum v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05900878 (1990), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he agency's consideration of appellant's pre-treatment record was erroneous. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Weinburger</span>, 600 F. Supp. 757, 762 (D.D.C. 1985), the court held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">an agency does not "reasonably accommodate" an alcoholic employee by keeping score of alcohol-induced, pretreatment transgressions and reviving them post-treatment for purposes of culmination with non-alcohol-related misconduct to produce an aggregate disciplinary record warranting more severe punishment.... In a disciplinary context, however, "reasonable accommodation" of an alcoholic employee requires forgiveness of his past alcohol-induced misconduct in proportion to his willingness to undergo and favorable response to treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consideration of the entire work record, including pretreatment offenses, is discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the general rule is that an agency may not take pretreatment offenses into account, an exception exists in the case of so-called last chance settlement agreements. In such a case, the Commission has held that past offenses may be taken into account by an agency in determining discipline if the employee subsequently breaches the agreement. However, in <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. Postmaster General</span>, 03910143 (1993), the Commission placed limitations on the use of past offenses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the agency's obligation to accommodate petitioner's disability, we find that an agency may enforce objective standards of performance and conduct contained in last chance agreements and may take into account past infractions to determine further discipline, including discharge, if the employee breaches the agreement. It may also do so without showing that the breach is caused by the employee having either continued or resumed drinking. If, however, the breach involves a time and attendance standard and the employee can demonstrate (1) that the absence was for a legitimate reason, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, one for which the agency would normally grant leave and (2) that the absence was not related to the employee's alcoholism, the agency may not invoke the last chance agreement. Instead, it must treat the absences of the employee as it would treat absences of the same nature by similarly situated employees not subject to last chance agreements. That is, the agency cannot take into account at this point any previous absences related to alcoholism for which the employee was subject to the last chance agreement in determining discipline. However, it may take into account for disciplinary purposes absences unrelated to alcoholism in the same way it would take into account similar absences of non-alcoholic employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that petitioner has shown that her December 1986--May 1987 unscheduled absences, which occurred after her successful completion of an inpatient treatment program and for which the agency actually granted leave, were legitimate and, as the AJ held, were not related to her alcoholism.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to her absences on December 1 and 2, 1986, petitioner testified that she was unable to remember her reasons for using sick leave on those days. The record does not indicate that the agency questioned the legitimacy of these absences; therefore, the Commission does not consider the legitimacy of these absences to be in issue. Petitioner testified that she used four hours of LWOP on December 22, <span id="Page_1336"></span>1986, because she was upset that her son had not come home the night before. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> With regard to the absences on January 22 and February 17, 1987, petitioner testified that she reported to work on both days but was sent home by the agency's nurse because of illness. The agency has not rebutted the petitioner's statement by producing evidence showing that her illnesses on those days were related to her alcoholism. At the hearing, petitioner stated that she used sick leave on March 2, 1987, because she was upset about her son who had not come home during the night. The record shows that petitioner's use of emergency annual leave on March 29, 1987, was not related to her alcoholism. In this regard, petitioner testified that many employees were absent that day as the result of a snowstorm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner testified that she reported to work on April 15, 1987, but she felt "helpless and suicidal" after she was informed that her son had been placed in a foster home. Petitioner met with an EAP Counselor and an appointment was scheduled for 8:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> that evening with an outside counseling group; however, petitioner testified that she was unable to wait for the appointment so she voluntarily entered the VAMC in Omaha. The medical evidence reveals that petitioner was admitted to the Omaha VAMC for treatment of major depression. On April 16, 1987, petitioner was transferred to the Knoxville VAMC where she remained until April 23, 1987. According to petitioner, on April 16, 1987, she telephoned the Tour 2 Supervisor of Time and Attendance and her direct supervisor and requested leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the four charges of AWOL, the Commission also finds, as did the AJ, that petitioner established that these absences were not related to her alcoholism. For example, petitioner noted that she was charged with .17 hours of AWOL on December 7, 1986, because she was less than 10 minutes late arriving to work. She also noted that she was charged with 4.5 hours of AWOL on December 10, 1986, because she overslept after staying awake during the night looking for her son. With regard to her absences on May 12 and 13, 1987, petitioner testified that she was discharged from the Omaha VAMC at approximately 1:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on May 12 and did not have enough time to report to work at the start of her tour at 2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Moreover, petitioner stated that when she arrived at home, she discovered that her landlord had evicted her and placed her personal belongings on the sidewalk. Petitioner also alleged in her appeal to the MSPB that she should not have been charged with AWOL on May 12 and 13, 1987, because she had been given indefinite sick leave on April 17, 1987.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not contain evidence from the agency to confirm or rebut petitioner's assertion that she was granted extended sick leave. The Commission also notes that there is no evidence in the record to indicate why the agency charged petitioner with AWOL for these absences, instead of granting leave for them, as was done with the unscheduled absences discussed above. That is, there is no documentation of any written policy governing situations such as those for which petitioner was charged AWOL, nor any testimonial evidence regarding actions taken in similar circumstances. Thus, although petitioner has established that her AWOL absences were not related to her alcoholism, the record does not establish whether those absences should be deemed legitimate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, it is necessary to remand this case for additional evidence to determine if the absences for which petitioner was charged AWOL were ones for which the agency normally would or did grant leave. If not, the absences could not be considered legitimate, and the agency could treat them as a violation of the last chance agreement, justifying disciplinary action. If, however, the evidence shows that the absences were legitimate, they could not be used as grounds for petitioner's removal. Instead, the agency could discipline petitioner for her absences during December 1986--May 1987, both those designated unscheduled and those designated AWOL, only to the extent that it would do so in the case of an individual with similar absences but no prior last chance agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a distinction between combining pretreatment and post-treatment offenses and disciplining an employee for pretreatment offenses. An agency is not required to excuse pretreatment conduct simply because it is related to alcoholism. In <span class="Italic">Purcell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05970773 (1999), the Commission held that a request for accommodation would not serve to retroactively excuse the complainant's poor performance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, however, the record reflects that appellant did not inform the agency of her disability or request an accommodation until after she received the performance appraisal at issue. The accommodation sought by appellant--a firm choice in lieu of the appraisal--amounted to a retroactive excuse for her poor performance for the period in question. The record also reflects that prior to appellant's request for an accommodation, the agency had reason to suspect the existence of appellant's disability but did not inquire whether she needed an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the responsibility of the individual with disability to request a needed reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (March 1, 1999), at 8-10. An employer is only obligated to initiate discussion of reasonable accommodation when: (1) it knows that the employee has a disability; (2) it knows or has reason to know that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability; and (3) it knows or has reason to know that the disability prevents the employee from requesting accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 51-52. Not withstanding that the agency may have suspected the existence of appellant's disability, the conditions which would have triggered a further duty to inquire were not met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, reasonable accommodation is always prospective, meaning that even once appellant disclosed her disability and requested reasonable accommodation, she was entitled to accommodation only from the date of such disclosure and request forward<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 48-49. Moreover, an employer is not required to excuse an employee from meeting conduct and performance standards that are uniformly applied, job-related, and consistent with business necessity, although the employer must make reasonable accommodation to help the employee meet the standards in the future if the employee is retained following a violation of such a standard. <span class="Italic">See id</span>, 47-49; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span> (March 25, 1997) (ASCII text) at 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission therefore finds that the agency was not required to offer appellant an accommodation, prior to her request, based on merely its suspicion that she had a disability, nor did the agency have a duty to retroactively excuse poor performance. Although the agency was obligated to respond to the request for an accommodation as to the future, appellant has not contended that the agency failed to do so, and the Commission makes no finding in this regard.</p>
