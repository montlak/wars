<h3 class="h3" id="sec19-63"><span class="space">C.</span> HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720160006 (2017), involved an agency program that, per the agency, audited the job duties of injured-on-duty employees (IODs) in an effort to determine whether those duties were in furtherance of the agency's ultimate mission of delivering the mail. IODs came to understand that, depending on the results of that audit, some jobs would be modified while other IODs would be placed on leave without pay. The Commission found that the program was used by officials to intentionally target IODs and discriminate against disabled employees. The implementation and administration of the program took more than five years, leading to protracted uncertainty as to IODs' employment future and hostile comments from other employees and management. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B</span>. found that the demoralizing effect of the program on the IODs passed the severe or pervasive test and established a hostile work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment of employees that would not occur but for their disability is unlawful if severe or pervasive. <span class="Italic">Wibstad v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972699 (Aug. 14, 1998). To prevail on a claim of class-wide harassment, the Class Agent must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that because of their status as individuals with disabilities, class members were subjected to conduct so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person in their position would have considered it hostile or abusive. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993). That conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victims' circumstances. Enforcement Guidance on <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994). Only if the Class Agent satisfies her burden of proof with respect to both of these elements, motive and hostility, will the question of Agency liability for discriminatory harassment present itself. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132783 (Sept. 11, 2015). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Dayle H. v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120130097 (June 15, 2016), <span class="Italic">citing Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The existence of the first element, motive, has been proven. The NRP, the reason behind the actions taken by the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, <span id="Page_1653"></span>the DATs, and other officials, has been shown to be discriminatory in that it targeted IOD employees, many of whom are qualified individuals with disabilities. Accordingly, any action taken by Agency officials in support of or furtherance of the NRP between May 5, 2006, and July 1, 2011, will be regarded as being motivated by unlawful considerations of the class members' disabilities. The only remaining question for liability is whether that conduct is severe or pervasive enough to be considered unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It bears repeating that, in general, neither single isolated acts nor sporadic incidents are enough to prove a pattern or practice of discrimination. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC, supra, citing Teamsters, supra. See also, e.g., Complainant v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120140786 (June 20, 2014) (supervisor's single, isolated suggestion that complainant apply for a greeter position at Walmart not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute harassment); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081659 (Sept. 3, 2009) and <span class="Italic">Gregory v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43820 (Sept. 10, 2004. The Agency contends on appeal that the conduct complained of consisted only of the "Walmart" comments and similar comments by the Postmaster General, the HHR Manager, and the WCO Director, which were made to each other in emails and were not even directed toward the IOD employees. But it was not just those comments that fueled the fire.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Throughout the Agency there was a pervasive fear among IOD employees that being subjected to the NRP would cause them to lose their jobs with the Agency and have to work in less-desirable jobs for employers such as Walmart or McDonald's, a fear that was stoked not only by managers but by other employees. The WCO Director acknowledged that he encountered anxiety among IOD employees again and again relayed by the unions and at employee town hall meetings. Rumors were being spread and derogatory comments were being made, sometimes by managers and supervisors, and sometimes by other employees. When the HHR Manager was asked in his deposition where employees' concern about ending up at Walmart came from he replied, "from all over the place." He admitted that he went to "so many meetings," and that he heard those rumors "from the unions and at town halls." When the pilot program for what would become the NRP was rolled out in February 2005, comments from non-IOD employees that were incorporated into a power-point presentation included, "way past due," "look for some miracle recoveries," "see you bums at Walmart," "it's about time," "have people sitting around the office doing minor jobs; makes you want to puke," "get rid of them all," "dead weight," and "good riddance." The Postmaster General at the time admitted that he talked with the HHR Manager and the Senior Vice President for Human Resources about working with outside employers to find jobs for people whose jobs had changed to the point where they could no longer sit to do their work. In a discussion that took place in September of 2010 concerning an upcoming meeting with a delegation from the China Post organization, the Manager of Complement Staffing and Field Policy made a joke about China Post taking some of their NRP employees. An anecdotal witness from Radford, Virginia testified that the Postmaster called him into her office and told him that they were going to transfer him to a "public sector" job, and when he asked whether she meant that he could be working at Walmart, the Postmaster replied, "[I]t could mean that." An anecdotal witness from Lansing, Michigan testified that he heard comments about injured-on-duty employees such as "sick laymen," "lazies," and "fakers." An anecdotal witness from Santa Clarita, California testified in her deposition that an NRP representative who was "very derogatory" in his tone and demeanor said that there were "going to be a lot of sorry 'rehabs' working at Walmart soon."

<p class="noindent-1">Just as a single comment in <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060086 (Oct. 31, 2008), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520090179 (Feb. 5, 2009), that Tour Supervisor Brown should quit the agency and become a greeter at K-Mart, gave rise to a hostile environment by aggravating Ms. Brown's pre-existing PTSD, so too did conduct of the officials carrying out the NRP give rise to a hostile environment by stoking the fear and anxiety that existed among IOD employees that they would lose their jobs. In both <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and the instant case, the conduct by Agency management aggravated the environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NRP teams' pursuit of their objectives during both phases of the program had a palpably demoralizing effect that was felt in every district. During Phase 1, NRP assessors were pressuring employees to provide their medical information. Employees were warned, in accordance with scripts provided to the assessors by the headquarters NRP team, that if they did not provide the requested information within two weeks, their limited-duty or rehabilitation assignments might be withdrawn. Several witnesses testified that they were constantly being pressured by NRP clerks to get updates from their doctors, even after they provided the requested information. Record at 16181-16184, 16305-16307, 16313. Others testified that they felt harassed because of the entire NRP process. Record, pp. 12321-12322. The WCO Director appeared to "go ballistic" when one district reported no retirements or resignations. Record at 13826. And the "Cripple Creek" incident only exacerbated the situation. Record at 13579, 12888-12890.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps the most glaring examples of hostility were the dismissals of IOD employees who, like the Class Agent, were given NWA determinations and ordered to leave. Step 14 of Phase 2 explicitly required that, upon completion of the second no-work-available interview, employees would be given the opportunity to clear out their lockers and gather their personal belongings. Afterward, they would be asked to turn their identification badges and would be immediately escorted out of the building. Record at 12992, 13064, 13766. The Class Agent described how emotionally traumatized she was by the incident. Record at 15353-15355. The Class Agent's union representative testified that he watched 20 other IOD employees being escorted out in a similar fashion, and with similar reactions. He noted that the escorts would walk the employees right through the middle of the workroom floor. Record at 15382. Other witnesses reported the same experience, with one testifying that he felt "ambushed." Another stated that she felt that she was being treated like a criminal. Record at 15604-15605, 15679-15680, 15694, 15810-15813, 16041, 16582. Eventually, the EEO Office heard of the practice and expressed concerns about it to the HHR Manager and the WCO Director. Record at 13842-13845.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, it was all of the actions taken by Agency officials to execute the NRP, and not just the Walmart comments, that gave rise to the hostile work environment. The only remaining question on this issue is the extent to which the Agency is liable. The Commission's policy guidance on vicarious liability for harassment states that an employer is always liable for harassment by a supervisor which culminates in a tangible employment action. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). A "tangible employment action" is characterized by the fact that it requires an official act; it usually inflicts direct economic harm; and it is usually initiated by a supervisor or other individual acting with the Agency's authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Removals stemming from NWA determinations would fall within the definition of tangible employment actions. New modified assignments might be considered tangible employment action if they cause harm to the individual or otherwise leave the individual less well-off than he or she was in the previous assignment. For those employees who separated voluntarily, either through retirements or resignation, they would have to prove that they were constructively discharged in order for their retirement or resignation to be considered a tangible employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IOD employees who returned to full duty as a result of the NRP and those whose positions did not change after being audited by the NRP were nevertheless subjected to the hostile work environment and are entitled to claim relief, unless the Agency can show that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and that the employee failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer to avoid harm otherwise. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Liability, supra</span>. As we stated previously, the acts of harassment committed by Agency officials in carrying out the mandate of the NRP to reduce the IOD rolls were numerous and pervasive. Towards the end of the program, the Agency did modify its Phase 2 procedures to explicitly allow for referrals to a DRAC, but only did so after being reminded of its Rehabilitation Act obligations by the EEO Office. By then, most of the damage already had been done. Until those changes were made, IOD employees who received an adverse assessment under the NRP had no recourse. Consequently, the Agency cannot invoke the affirmative defense against the Class Agent's hostile environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, while operating under the auspices of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Section 102(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by subjecting IOD employees assessed under the NRP to a hostile work environment and by subjecting to tangible employment actions IOD employees given NWA determinations, IOD employees given new modified assignments, and possibly IOD employees who voluntarily separated via resignation or retirement. We conclude that the Agency has not raised any genuine issue of material fact that would warrant a hearing on this issue. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must establish that they are qualified individuals with disabilities. They must also establish that they suffered compensable harm for which damages may be awarded. Those class members who were subjected to tangible employment actions may be eligible for equitable remedies such as reinstatement and back pay. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief, having established that she is a qualified individual with a disability and that she was subjected to a tangible employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The class in <span class="Italic">Velva B.</span> further alleged that IOD employees were segregated from the rest of the workforce when they were forced to report to "standby rooms," which also created a hostile work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that segregation of a class of workers, if established, would support a finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Walton v. <span id="Page_1654"></span>Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072925 (Jul. 10, 2012), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 0520120598 (Feb. 7, 2013) (White employees assigned to a separate side of a workshop from Black employees); <span class="Italic">Pruneda</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (all workers reassigned to newly created 2:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. to 11:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. shift were limited-duty employees or "rehab" employees in modified carrier positions). In order to establish class-wide liability, the Class Agent would have to show that officials who ordered that IOD employees be placed in standby rooms had done so under the auspices of the NRP and that those placed in standby rooms were physically separated from the rest of the workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of the Class Agent's anecdotal witnesses testified in their depositions that they had been ordered to report to standby rooms following NRP interviews. One witness from Kenosha, Wisconsin had received a notification on November 25, 2009, that as a limited-duty employee who had reached her level of maximum medical improvement, she would need to clock in on "standby time" and report to a room in the basement. She testified that the room was cold and infested with mice, and that she had to go to her union representative to find another location for her. A witness from Boston testified that in September of 2008, she was sent to a room called "the fishbowl" and kept off the workroom floor along with 30 other people. A third witness, from Yuba City, California, also testified that she was forced to sit in a basement room alone during May of 2007, but also stated that other injured employees were doing work that she had done for the past several years. Yet another witness, from Denton, Texas, testified that after his ergonomic chair was taken way in April 2010, he and another IOD employee were sent to a standby room referred to as "the exercise room," and that he filed a grievance on the matter which was settled prior to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In June of 2009, a number of email exchanges took place between area and district officials in Dallas and Fort Worth, and the HHR Manager and WCO Director on the subject of standby rooms. In an email dated June 17, 2009, the WCO Director informed the local DAT members that use of a standby room for injured workers would "not be in the best interest of the Agency and would not be supported by headquarters." Later that day, the HHR Manager sent an email to the DAT leader in Dallas telling him, "don't even think about" using standby rooms. On June 23, 2009, the WCO Director advised the DAT leader in Dallas that if standby rooms were necessary, decisions to utilize such rooms should be made on a case-by-case basis, that a single location should not be designated, and that standby time should be utilized for both injured and non-injured employees. The WCO Director emphasized that what needed to be avoided was the placement of only injured employees on standby time in a separate room.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency noted that the AJ rejected the Class Agent's argument that the use of standby rooms created a hostile work environment because the Class Agent had not shown that standby rooms were used as part of the NRP Policy. Based on her interpretation of the June 2009 email conversations and the documents and testimony from the anecdotal witnesses, the AJ determined that there was insufficient evidence to show that standby rooms were used as part of the nationalized NRP policy. We agree with the AJ's assessment. There is no question that a number of IOD employees were sent to standby rooms. What we cannot determine from the testimony of, and records pertaining to, the anecdotal witnesses is whether IOD employees were actually separated from non-injured employees, as they clearly were in Pruneda, nor whether the practice of sending employees to standby rooms was widespread or confined to just a few districts. Moreover, the lack of specific references to standby rooms in the NRP documentation, which apparently led to the email exchange between the headquarters NRP team and the local officials in Dallas and Fort Worth, together with the email conversations themselves, tends to show that the use of standby rooms was never contemplated as being necessary to the implementation of the NRP. Accordingly, we find that the evidence of record is not sufficient to support a conclusion that IOD employees who were directed to report to standby rooms were sent there under the auspices of the NRP or were segregated from the rest of the workforce in violation of Section 102(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
