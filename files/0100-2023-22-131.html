<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-130"><span class="space">9.</span> Work Schedules</h4>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, requests for work schedule accommodations to participate in religious practices are the most common battleground in this arena. The permutations are as endless as the number of religious practices and the varying requirements of agencies and positions. Because the Commission analyzes the issue of reasonable accommodation of religious beliefs on a case-by-case basis, some examples are in order.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency demonstrates an undue burden when it shows that it considered all available options and that the implementation of any option would have required excessive overtime on a regular basis, a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, or a violation of agency regulations. <span class="Italic">Owings v. USPS</span>, 01841576 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Owings</span>, a part-time mail clerk claimed that the agency <span id="Page_1073"></span>did not fulfill its burden of accommodating his religious beliefs that required observance of the Sabbath from sundown Friday night to sundown Saturday. For several weeks, the employee left work at 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on Friday, was charged with AWOL and eventually removed on that basis. The agency presented a list of five alternatives it considered along with its reasons for rejecting each alternative. In summary, placing appellant on another tour of duty would have required specialized scheme knowledge the appellant did not possess; allowing appellant Friday nights off would have resulted in either constant additional overtime charges to the agency, or delayed mail; requiring a regular employee to swap schedules would have violated the collective bargaining agreement; and transfer would have violated an agency regulation against transfers during the probationary period. In <span class="Italic">Owings</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hardison</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Court indicated that accommodations that would require an employer to regularly pay premium wages, such as overtime, to substitute employees impose more than a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> cost on the employer and constitute an undue hardship. Accommodations that would require an employer to infringe on the seniority rights of other employees, or to understaff its business operations also constitute an undue hardship to the agency. Nor is an employer required to violate its own lawful regulations in order to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission noted that it was not necessary for the agency actually to implement a proposed accommodation to determine it would impose an undue hardship on the agency. But when the agency terminates an employee who refuses to work Saturdays for religious reasons prior to any actual assessment of whether accommodation is possible, the termination violates Title VII. <span class="Italic">Brenner v. USPS</span>, 01841707 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The employer does not accommodate a religious belief by giving an employee most Saturdays off when his religion requires that he not work on Saturdays. The Commission found this "required that appellant compromise his religious beliefs. One court has held that such a scenario improperly placed the burden on the employee (who was entitled to accommodation) to be reasonable rather than on the employer to accommodate." <span class="Italic">Parajan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01901209 (1990). However, the employer can carry its burden of proof by showing that it would place an undue hardship on the agency to schedule all Saturdays as off-days for the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an agency is not required to accommodate an employee by giving him all Saturdays off if it would impose an undue hardship. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130544 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we concur with the AJ's determination that Complainant has not shown that the Agency denied him a religious accommodation. The record shows that Complainant is scheduled to work the night shift from midnight to 8:00 <span class="small">AM</span>, with two consecutive days off. Those consecutive days off rotate so that no employees are consistently scheduled to work on weekends. On May 14, 2010, Complainant sent an email to management requesting the religious accommodation of being permanently excused from working a Saturday shift. After consulting with the Agency's EEO office, management determined that providing Complainant with a permanent schedule change would have an adverse impact on patient care and staff as it would require Complainant's coworkers to cover the shift thereby requiring them to work additional weekend days, or it would require the Agency to have to pay overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, in lieu of providing Complainant with a permanent schedule change, management encouraged Complainant to voluntarily switch shifts with a coworker if he was scheduled for a Saturday shift. The record shows, however, and Complainant acknowledges, that from the time he requested religious accommodation, the Agency has not scheduled him to work from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. EEOC guidance states that the employer's obligation is to make a "good faith effort to allow voluntary substitution and shift swaps and not to discourage employees from substituting for one another or trading shifts to accommodate a religious conflict." <span class="Italic">See</span> Questions and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace, EEOC Laws and Guidance (Jan. 31, 2011). We find that although management denied the specific accommodation requested by Complainant, it provided an alternative which would accommodate his religious objection to working from sundown on Friday through sundown on Saturday. Further, the record shows that Complainant has not been scheduled to work that shift since requesting an accommodation. Accordingly, we concur with the AJ's finding that Complainant has not shown that he was subjected to unlawful religious discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120150382 (2016), the Commission found that the agency did not engage in a good faith effort to give the complainant every Saturday off as an accommodation, noting that mere inconvenience to other employees did not constitute an undue hardship:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate the complainant's religious beliefs and, if such proof fails, the agency must show that the alternative means of accommodation proffered by complainant could not be granted without imposing an undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Tiano v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc.,</span> 139 F.3d 679, 681 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Redmond v. GAF Corporation</span>, 574 F.2d 897, 902 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Cardona v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890532 (October 25, 1989). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(a)-(e), the Commission's "Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion" (the Guidelines), alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes. Undue hardship does not become a defense until the employer claims it as a defense to its duty to accommodate. <span class="Italic">Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook</span>, 479 U.S. 60, 68-69 (1986). In order to show undue hardship, an employer must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 74 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, management explained that the existing rotation allowed Complainant to have some Saturdays off. Without stating explicitly, the Agency indicated that to require the other QAEs to always cover Saturdays would be an undue hardship. Both Supervisor C and the Store Director attested that granting Complainant's request for every Saturday off "would not be fair" to the other three QAEs. The Commission does not agree that the perception of "unfairness," without more, constitutes an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to Complainant's assertion that there were five individuals that could serve as QAEs, management countered that the supervisor could not be in the rotation and the other individual cited by Complainant was not a QAE. Nonetheless, Complainant attested that Supervisor C's predecessor granted her request for every Saturday off, even with only three QAEs. The record reflects that the Store Director suggested to Complainant that she ask coworkers to swap. The Director also noted that she was unaware of whether or not Complainant took such action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has found acceptable several alternatives for accommodating conflicts between work schedules and religious practices, including voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, or lateral transfer and change of job assignments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(d). With regard to voluntary substitutions or swaps, the Commission believes the obligation to accommodate requires employers to facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute. <span class="Italic">Samuelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112777 (February 19, 2013). Some ways of doing this are publicizing policies regarding accommodation and voluntary substitution, promoting an atmosphere in which substitutions are favorably regarded, or providing a central file, bulletin board, or other means for making voluntary substitutes available. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01092 (June 29, 2001), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A10911 (November 16, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not show that the Agency took any action to facilitate voluntary swaps. Instead, management placed the burden solely on Complainant. Consequently, we do not find that the Agency's actions (i.e. permitting Complainant some Saturdays off and suggesting that Complainant ask colleagues to swap schedules) constituted a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate Complainant's religious beliefs. Further, management's belief, that requiring Complainant's colleagues to work on her Saturdays would be unfair, does not in itself comprise an undue hardship especially in light of the evidence that Supervisor C's predecessor was able to grant Complainant's request for every Saturday off.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review of the evidence of record shows that Complainant has established that she was discriminated against when the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate her religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120080191 (2010), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant, the wife of a Baptist minister, when it agreed to alter her schedule on Sundays to work before or after services, but would not allow her Sundays off to engage in other church activities. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">White</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this instant case, we note that the AJ found that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a denial of religious accommodation. We disagree. Complainant is a member of a Baptist church where her husband is a minister. Further, the agency does not dispute that complainant requested Sundays off to attend church services. Nevertheless, complainant was denied the opportunity to take Sundays off of work to attend the church services she requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate complainant's religious beliefs and, if such proof fails, the agency must show that the alternative means of accommodation proffered by complainant could not be granted without imposing an undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Tiano v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc</span>., 139 F.3d 679, 681 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Redmond v. GAF Corporation</span>, 574 F.2d 897, 902 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Cardona v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890532 (October 25, 1989). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(a)-(e), the Commission's "Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion" (the Guidelines), alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, <span id="Page_1074"></span>flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes. Undue hardship does not become a defense until the employer claims it as a defense to its duty to accommodate. <span class="Italic">Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook</span>, 479 U.S. 60. 68-69 (1986). In order to show undue hardship, an employer must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 74 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, we find that the agency failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate complainant's religious beliefs, or that to do so would have imposed an undue hardship upon the agency's operations. The AJ found that the agency provided complainant with flexible scheduling because it offered her various schedules that would allow her to attend church services either before or after work on Sundays. However, these schedules would not allow complainant to attend Sunday school in the morning and afternoon church meetings as she requested. We note that complainant requested the entire day of Sunday off for the observance of her religious faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, there is no evidence in the record that the agency attempted to obtain voluntary substitutes or swaps for the Sundays that complainant was made to work. Based on complainant's supervisor's affidavit, there were six meat cutters who had Sundays off. The agency has provided no evidence as to why complainant could not have switched or rotated schedules with these employees. In particular, the agency made no showing that it made inquiries into which of the complainant's colleagues might be interested in a swap. We also note that in his affidavit, complainant's supervisor admitted that he was not aware of agency policies or guidelines regarding religious accommodation. Without the type of evidence discussed here, we find that the agency's contention, that granting complainant's request for Sunday as a regular day off would have left the facility short staffed causing an undue hardship, is mere speculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">"An employer is not required to guarantee that an employee will never be required to work on a particular religious holiday." <span class="Italic">DiMetro v. Postmaster General</span>, 01881389 (1988). It is not a failure to accommodate when the agency demonstrates extraordinary conditions that require it to deny a particular request for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A request for a religious accommodation is not rendered moot where the agency's accommodation is interim in nature or addresses only a portion of the complainant's request. For example, in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01964035 (1997), the agency gave the complainant, as a temporary accommodation, a schedule change that allowed him to have Saturdays off. However, in addition to the temporary nature of the accommodation, the schedule change did not address the employee's contention that the Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01976745 (2000), the Commission reached a similar conclusion where it allowed the employees to take annual leave for Sunday worship. Under the collective bargaining agreement, the leave could be converted to a regular day off, though the contract did not guarantee conversion. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> found the agency had not accommodated the complainants:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency failed to meet this burden. In this regard, we are not persuaded that the agency made a reasonable effort to accommodate the complainants' religious beliefs, or that to do so would have imposed an undue hardship upon the agency's operations. The agency submits that its and the union's suggestion that approved leave requests could be converted to regular days off solves its accommodation obligation. We disagree. This accommodation suggestion represents a patchwork approach which makes no attempt to permanently resolve the underlying scheduling conflict. While a permanent solution is not a requirement of the agency's accommodation obligations, reasonable efforts might have afforded a more desirable and lasting solution for all parties. We note that the agency stated that the complainants could have done a schedule swap. Yet, the agency made no showing that it made inquiries into which of the complainants' colleagues might have been interested in a swap.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we note the complainants' contentions on appeal that the collective bargaining agreement provided that compensatory time was a relevant consideration when exploring accommodation options. We find no evidence that the opportunity to work compensatory time as a flexible scheduling alternative was even presented to the complainants<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5550a. While the agency might argue that its offers to permit the complainants to use annual leave, which could be converted to a regular day off, satisfies its accommodation obligation, we disagree. When there is more than one method of accommodation available which would not cause undue hardship, the agency must offer the alternative which least disadvantages the individual with respect to his or her employment opportunities, such as compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.2(c)(2) (ii). In the instant matter, flexible scheduling through the use of compensatory time would have disadvantaged the complainants less than forcing them to use annual leave. Moreover, nothing in the agency's suggestion concerning the conversion of annual leave guaranteed that the annual leave would in fact be converted to a regular day off. Finally, we note that the agency made no showing that the least effort to explore these alternatives would have presented an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While, as the agency argues, granting all of the requests for Sundays as a regular day off may have left the facility short staffed and therefore the agency would have incurred an undue hardship, the agency failed to show that it would have to bear this undue hardship, or any other, in resolving the complainants' scheduling conflicts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mann v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880166 (1988), the agency failed to demonstrate an undue burden where it did not introduce any evidence that granting the accommodation would violate a seniority provision of the collective bargaining agreement, the agency accommodated the complainant through temporary shift changes for a year and a half, and there were only <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> costs in the payroll changes occasioned by the temporary shift changes. The Commission also rejected an argument that the complainant failed to assist in her own accommodation because she failed to qualify for jobs with the appropriate days off. Finally, the Commission noted that mere grumbling by fellow workers about an accommodation did not constitute an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Mann</span> was subsequently transferred to a new work location where her requested accommodation did impose an undue burden on the agency. As a result, she was required to choose between being on the overtime duty list and being declared AWOL if she did not accept assignments on her Sabbath, or not being on the list at all. In <span class="Italic">Morley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912015 (1991), the Commission fully explained its second <span class="Italic">Mann</span> decision, as well as its previous decision in <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency effectively informed appellant that it could not accommodate his religious beliefs in any manner when it stated that unless he was willing to work overtime on his Sabbath, he could not place his name on the OTDL. Appellant, not wishing to risk an AWOL charge if he was scheduled to work on his Sabbath and refused to work, removed his name from the OTDL. The agency argues that it became aware that its policy of allowing employees to place their names on the OTDL but refrain for accepting overtime on their Sabbath was in conflict with the National Agreement, which provides that: employees on the OTDL must be willing to accept overtime when scheduled, and employees not on the OTDL may not be required to work overtime unless all employees on the OTDL are unavailable or have already been utilized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that the Commission should follow its prior decision in <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, (EEOC Request No. 05900994, Nov. 20, 1990), wherein the Commission found no discrimination and no failure to accommodate in a similar factual situation. However, after a review of the present record and the <span class="Italic">Mann</span> decision, the Commission finds that these two cases are distinguishable, and that the instant case is more appropriate for analysis in accordance with the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Jenoe Rottenberg v. Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891132 (January 10, 1990), Request to Reopen Denied, EEOC Request No. 05900433 (August 2, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, the complainant was an employee who had signed the OTDL, but had been allowed to refrain from accepting overtime on her Sabbath until November, 1985. At that time, the complainant had recently transferred to a new pay location. In her new section there were only six employees, including appellant and another employee not on the OTDL (Comparison 1), who were qualified for overtime on the particular scheme. The complainant had more seniority than Comparison 1 and was second in seniority overall. On November 13, 1985, the need for overtime on the following Friday evening (the complainant's Sabbath) arose for the first time since the complainant had been in the new pay location. On that particular Friday, only the complainant and Comparison 1 were qualified and available for overtime; however, Comparison 1 was not on the OTDL.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in accordance with the terms of the National Agreement, the complainant's new supervisor directed her to report for overtime on Friday evening. The complainant objected to working on her Sabbath. Thereafter, the <span class="Italic">Mann</span> decision reveals that both a Labor Relations Specialist and a union steward were contacted in an effort to try to accommodate the complainant's request to be excused from overtime. The decision indicates that the complainant and the union steward requested that the agency ask Comparison 1 if she would consider working for the complainant on Friday evening. However, Comparison 1 told her supervisor that she had plans for Friday evening, and that she should not be required to work before an employee on the OTDL. Furthermore, Comparison 1 stated that she would file a grievance if required to work. Only at this point, after Comparison 1 threatened to file a grievance, did the agency advise the complainant that her request to be excused from overtime on Friday, November 13, 1985, could not be accommodated. The record indicates that the Tour Supervisor informed <span id="Page_1075"></span>the complainant that she could remove her name from the OTDL if she wished, and that if she remained on the list "in these types of situations," she would be required to work overtime. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mann</span> found that the agency's attempts to find a substitute to work overtime for the complainant constituted a legitimate attempt to provide reasonable accommodation. The Commission noted that because the only qualified and available substitute refused to work the assignment, the conflict between the complainant's religious beliefs and the agency's employment practices had not been eliminated. After analyzing the options for accommodation suggested by the complainant, the Commission concluded that the alternatives offered would impose an undue hardship upon the agency's operations; therefore, the agency had fulfilled its obligation to attempt to accommodate the complainant's religious beliefs. The Commission concluded that the agency had not discriminated against the complainant on the basis of her religion, nor had it forced her to remove her name from the overtime list. Instead, the Commission found that the agency made a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant, but that despite its efforts it was unable to excuse her from overtime on a specific occasion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, the Commission distinguished its prior decision in <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span>, wherein the Commission had found religious discrimination. The Commission emphasized that in <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span> the agency denied the complainant therein the right to sign the OTDL, whereas in <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, the complainant stated that she was not pressured or otherwise forced to remove her name from the OTDL. In addition, the Commission stated that in <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, the agency contacted a union steward in an effort to accommodate appellant's religious beliefs, whereas in <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span>, the agency did not similarly attempt to determine whether a mutually agreeable accommodation could be reached. The Commission also noted that in <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span>, the agency's determination that it could not accommodate the complainant's request was speculative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span> reveals that the complainant in that case was denied permission to place his name on the OTDL because he was unwilling to work on his Sabbath or on other Jewish holidays. The agency denied the complainant's request to place his name on the list on the grounds that pursuant to the agency's collective bargaining agreement, any employee who places his name on the OTDL must be available to work on any day he or she is called to work overtime. The agency argued that if the complainant was allowed to place his name on the OTDL but [was] excused from working overtime on his Sabbath, this would upset the seniority sequence under which employees are called to work overtime, and would also lead to the filing of grievances. The agency did not make any attempt to accommodate the complainant's request, because the agency believed that accommodating the complainant would violate the collective bargaining agreement. The Commission found the agency's argument in regard to the potential filing of grievances to be speculative and insufficient to show undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the instant case distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Mann</span> and similar to <span class="Italic">Rottenberg</span>. In <span class="Italic">Mann</span> the agency was able to show that it attempted to resolve the conflict by consulting a union steward and asking Comparison 1 to work for the complainant, but that its attempt at accommodation revealed that if the agency had required Comparison 1 to substitute for the complainant, the agency would have violated Comparison 1's contractual rights and she would have filed a grievance. In that case, there was no one else available; therefore, the agency had no choice but to require the complainant to abide by her obligation to work overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that a claim of undue hardship cannot be supported by merely conceivable or hypothetical hardships; instead, it must be supported by proof of actual imposition on coworkers or disruption of the work routine. <span class="Italic">Tooley v. Martin-Marietta Corp.</span>, 648 F.2d 1239, 1243 (9th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Cardona</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890532. The Commission presumes, though, that undue hardship would be shown where a variance from a <span class="Italic">bona</span> <span class="Italic">fide</span> seniority system that is necessary in order to accommodate an employee's religious practices would deny another employee of his or her shift preference guaranteed by that system. <span class="Italic">Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 80; <span class="Italic">Cardona</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890532. An agency may show "undue hardship" where the accommodation requested would conflict with a valid collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 79-85.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that where religious accommodation would violate a collective bargaining agreement, the agency must still make a good faith effort to determine whether permissible alternatives for accommodation exist.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where one agency supervisor initially excused the complainant from an overtime assignment to attend mass but another supervisor ordered the complainant to work the assignment and threatened him with discipline if he refused, the Commission found that the agency had failed to establish it would have been an undue hardship to accommodate the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090033 (2011), the Commission upheld the administrative judge's decision granting summary judgment to the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that under Title VII, employers are required to accommodate the religious practices of their employees unless a requested accommodation is shown to impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(b)(1). The traditional framework for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on religious accommodation requires Complainant to demonstrate that: (1) he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief, the practice of which conflicted with their employment, (2) he informed the Agency of this belief and conflict, and (3) the Agency nevertheless enforced its requirement against Complainant. <span class="Italic">Heller v. EBB Auto Co.,</span> 8 F.3d 1433, 1438 (9th Cir. 1993);<span class="Italic"> Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.R. Co.,</span> 736 F.2d 1022, 1026 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the Agency must show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate complainant's religious beliefs and, if such proof fails, the Agency must show that the alternative means of accommodation proffered by complainant could not be granted without imposing an undue hardship on the Agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Tiano v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc.,</span> 139 F.3d 679, 681 (9th Cir. 1998);<span class="Italic"> Redmond v. GAF Corp.,</span> 574 F.2d 897, 902 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Cardona v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05890532 (October 25, 1989). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(a)-(e), the Commission's "Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion" (the Guidelines), alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes. Undue hardship does not become a defense until the employer claims it as a defense to its duty to accommodate. <span class="Italic">Ansonia Bd of Ed. v. Philbrook,</span> 479 U.S. 60, 68-69 (1986). In order to show undue hardship, an employer must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,</span> 432 U.S. 63, 74 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, with regard to voluntary substitutions or swaps, the Commission believes the obligation to accommodate requires employers to facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute. Some ways of doing this are publicizing policies regarding accommodation and voluntary substitution, promoting an atmosphere in which substitutions are favorably regarded, or providing a central file, bulletin board, or other means for making voluntary substitutes available. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A01092 (June 29, 2001); <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied,</span> Request No. 05A10911 (November 16, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we agree with the AJ's finding that there are no material facts in dispute. All parties are in agreement that Complainant was assigned overtime, that he complained of the conflict with his religious belief, and that he was ordered to complete the assignment or face disciplinary action. Indeed, Complainant did in fact complete the assignment. Furthermore, there is no dispute that S1 initially excused Complainant from his assignment, lending support for the notion that a swap was an available accommodation. No evidence was presented as to why replacing Complainant would violate "established policy," as the Chief averred, especially since he likewise stated that Complainant would have been replaced if he had been excused from the overtime. No evidence was presented as to the cost of "call back and commute pay," or how it was an undue burden for the Agency to have permitted the two hour delay in the start of his shift as an accommodation. Rather, the evidence was undisputed that Complainant was initially accommodated with a replacement, and then directed to his assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency explores voluntary shift changes and transfer to another facility, it would be an undue hardship to require the agency to vary its seniority procedures in order to accommodate a religious observance of the Sabbath. <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 01860309 (1987). However, the failure to explore any possible shift changes can result in the agency being unable to demonstrate undue hardship. In <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120112943 (2011), the complainant sought Sundays off to attend religious services. The agency denied the request without considering any possible alternatives. As a result, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">White</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we now turn to the Agency's argument of undue hardship. Undue hardship may be shown where the costs of the proffered accommodation are more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or where such accommodation would deny another employee his job shift guaranteed by a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> seniority system. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A010 (June 29, 2001),<span class="Italic"> request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A10911 (Nov. 16, 2001); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(e). We find that the AJ correctly held that the Agency failed to meet its burden. The AJ noted that the Second Line Supervisor specifically stated that he did not look into the possibility of having other employees voluntarily switch schedules in order to accommodate Complainant. As such, we determine that the AJ properly determined that the Agency discriminated against Complainant when he was denied a religious accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the complainant's constructive discharge claim failed because he <span id="Page_1076"></span>could not show that he was actually denied any request for Sundays off.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency fails to meet its burden of demonstrating undue hardship when it refuses to facilitate a voluntary shift change to accommodate religious beliefs where it has facilitated shift changes for other reasons. In <span class="Italic">Partridge v. Postmaster General</span>, 01943980 (1996), the Commission brushed aside an argument that the shift change would violate the collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency has failed to meet its burden to show that it could not reasonably accommodate appellant. In this case, the duty to reasonably accommodate, in accordance with Commission guidelines, required the agency to facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute for appellant. There is some evidence that a voluntary swap could have been arranged. Comparison 1 was able to take off December 5, 1992 by swapping her scheduled off-day with Employee 2. This was arranged and approved after appellant's request. Also, there were two other carriers who had scheduled off-days on December 5, 1992 who could have been solicited to make voluntary exchanges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As there is some evidence that appellant could have been reasonably accommodated with a voluntary swap, and there is no evidence that the agency attempted to facilitate this, it failed to show appellant could not be reasonably accommodated without undue hardship. There is no evidence a swap would violate the CBA, or that a waiver from the CBA could not be obtained, especially since requests to change scheduled off-days have repeatedly been approved by stewards. Accordingly we find appellant was discriminated against on the basis of religion when he was not reasonably accommodated<span class="Italic">. See Harley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922249 (April 27, 1993) (The agency denied the complainant's request for a day off to go to a religious convention. In finding that the agency failed to show that reasonably accommodating the complainant's religious observance would constitute an undue hardship, the Commission observed that the record was void of any evidence that "voluntary substitutes or a change in appellant's work schedule were attempted by...the agency."); <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ithaca Industries, Inc.</span>, 849 F.2d 116, 117-119 (4th Cir. 1988) (Working on Sundays violated the complainant's religious beliefs. Due to increased demands, the employer commenced operating its plant on eight Sundays a year. The court found that the employer failed to show that accommodating the complainant's religious observance constituted an undue hardship. In so doing, the court noted that while the employer asked for volunteers to work on Sundays, it did not look to other shifts to fill the positions. The court also observed that while at times the employer suggested that an employee seek a substitute, it did not do so with the complainant, nor provide a central bulletin board for matching substitutes).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Read v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983271 (1999), the agency failed to demonstrate an undue hardship where the complainant introduced evidence that there were others willing to change work schedules with him to accommodate his request to have Sunday as an off-day. The agency's speculation that other Christians would also want Sunday off did not demonstrate an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">But an agency is not required to do more than facilitate the shift changes. In <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01951063 (1997), the Commission found that allowing the appellant to swap shifts in order to observe the Sabbath was sufficient accommodation for his religious beliefs. The agency in <span class="Italic">Dorsey</span> was not required to further accommodate the appellant when his coworkers refused to voluntarily swap shifts with him:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency asserts that it made every effort to accommodate appellant's requested work schedule prior to the loss of the two crew members in September 1993. Thereafter, the agency permitted appellant to swap schedules with other employees. This method enabled appellant to observe his Sabbath for some time. However, several of appellant's coworkers ceased agreeing to swap shifts with appellant because he refused to reciprocate when they sought to swap. In addition, it appears that appellant was adverse to swapping for less desirable graveyard shifts. Although appellant denies refusing to reciprocate, the record does not support his denial. While appellant appears to believe that other employees should simply be required to work in his stead during the Sabbath, the record establishes that all of appellant's coworkers are already required to work every other weekend. Given the agency's efforts to schedule around appellant's religious holy days when sufficient personnel were available, and its allowance of voluntary shift swaps, the Commission finds that the agency met its burden of reasonably accommodating appellant's religious needs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Granting a few leave without pay requests does not constitute reasonable accommodation of a religious belief where the agency makes no effort to resolve the underlying schedule conflict on a permanent basis. <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921341 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency need not ensure that an employee who requests religious accommodation is able to work the same amount of overtime as employees who do not need religious accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Rowe v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01956213 (1997), the Commission found that the fact that most overtime opportunities were on Saturdays, when the complainant was unable to work, did not require the agency to create a new overtime system:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that the system discriminated against him because most overtime opportunities occurred on Saturdays, when he was unable, for religious reasons, to work. He argues that the agency should have established a system whereby he could remain at the top of the list until he could accept an overtime opportunity. We disagree. Under Title VII, the agency's obligation was to create a neutral system for the distribution of overtime that did not operate to interfere with appellant's exercise of his religion. This the agency did. Nothing in Title VII required the agency to create a system guaranteeing that appellant would be able to work a certain number of overtime hours equal to the number of hours worked by employees not constrained by the religious practices that limited appellant's ability to accept overtime assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency terminates a previous agreement with the complainant that provided for religious accommodation, it must come forward with evidence demonstrating the accommodation posed an undue hardship. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01980813 (2000), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the determination in the agency's final decision that complainant was never denied accommodation for his religious needs. When the agency terminated the arrangement by which complainant could use compensatory time on Thursdays in order to leave early on Fridays and instead required him to take annual leave, it disadvantaged complainant with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 5550a and 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.2(c)(2)(ii). Flexible scheduling through the use of compensatory time would have disadvantaged complainant less than forcing him to use his annual leave. Further, it seems unlikely that allowing complainant to continue to use the compensatory time alternative would have caused an undue hardship on the agency. Moreover, the agency failed to show that continuing to allow complainant to make use of the flexible scheduling arrangement would have caused it undue hardship. Accordingly, we find that the agency improperly determined that it had not failed to accommodate complainant's religious practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, when the agency granted a schedule accommodation for a number of years it will have a more difficult time arguing that granting it again constitutes an undue hardship. In <span class="Italic">Rechter v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10013 (2001), the agency argued that it would be an undue hardship to change the schedule to allow the complainant not to work on Yom Kippur. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Rechter</span> found that, based partially on its conduct in the past, the agency failed to establish undue hardship:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that during the relevant time, complainant was employed as a City Letter Carrier at the agency's Garden City Branch in Providence, Rhode Island ("facility"). The record indicates that for the seven (7) years prior to the appointment of the current facility Station Manager (SM), complainant was allowed to make a Change of Schedule for the Jewish holidays. Complainant's Change of Schedule request for a religious holiday was denied for the first time by the current SM. Believing he was a victim of discrimination, complainant sought EEO counseling and subsequently filed a formal complaint on October 30, 1997. At the conclusion of the investigation, complainant was provided a copy of the investigative report and requested a hearing before an EEOC AJ. The AJ issued a decision without a hearing, finding discrimination. The AJ concluded that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of failure to provide religious accommodation. The AJ then found that the agency failed to meet its burden of showing that providing the requested religious accommodation would pose an undue hardship. In so finding, the AJ noted that the agency had not demonstrated how granting a religious accommodation by allowing complainant to alter his schedule to observe a religious holiday now constituted an undue hardship when the facility had approved complainant's Change of Schedule requests for the seven years prior to 1997.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's final order stated that it would not implement the AJ's decision, finding that the AJ's decision was not supported by the evidence of record. In its timely appeal, the agency argues that it granted complainant annual leave for the holiday in question and thus accommodated him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's decision summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. The Commission agrees with the AJ that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious discrimination under the standard set forth above. Complainant informed the agency that he sought a change of schedule in order to observe the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, but the agency refused the Change of Schedule request. In addition, we agree with the AJ's finding that the agency failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that it could not accommodate complainant without incurring undue hardship. The agency has failed to introduce credible evidence which demonstrates that allowing complainant to change his schedule to observe Yom Kippur would <span id="Page_1077"></span>have involved an actual imposition on coworkers or disruption of work schedules or routines. We thus discern no basis to disturb the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bryce A. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020001712 (2021) (agency failed to prove undue burden where the requested accommodation had been allowed for a period of two months without incident).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, in <span class="Italic">Manalo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A14800 (2003), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant's religious beliefs where it denied her request to take Good Friday off, even though the agency granted her request the previous eight years. The agency asserted that it denied the request because the complainant had received the day off for eight years and it also suspected she was engaged in leave abuse. The Commission found that "[t]his explanation does not even attempt to indicate how giving complainant the 9th Good Friday in a row off would impose more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost on the agency. Rather, it suggests that as a punishment for exercising her right to a reasonable accommodation of her religion in the past and for, perhaps, abusing her sick leave, complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation. This explanation does not meet the agency's burden of establishing undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
