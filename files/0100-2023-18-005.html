<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-6"><span class="space">2.</span> Role During Agency Processing of Complaint; Intrusion/Interference Complaints</h4>
<p class="noindent">The EEO process is, to say the least, an unusual one that requires the agency accused of engaging in discrimination to conduct its own investigation of the complaint. An agency is responsible for implementing EEO procedures that ensure compliance with the Commission's regulations at 29 CFR Part 1614 "and the instructions for complaint processing contained in the Commission's Management Directives." 29 CFR 1614.104(a). The Commission's regulations require an agency to conduct an "impartial and appropriate" investigation of a complaint. 29 CFR 1614.106(e)(2). As noted immediately above, from the outset, MD-110 required that "[h]eads of agency must not permit intrusion on the investigations and deliberations of EEO complaints by agency representatives and offices responsible for defending the agency against EEO complaints." The main problem has been and remains that the EEOC has refused to issue any specific guidance on what, if any, role agency counsel has during the agency's processing of a complaint given that the agency's EEO function is intended to be neutral and conduct "impartial" investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two competing principles that come into play regarding the proper role of agency defense counsel in an EEO complaint. On the one hand, the agency head is charged in the EEO process with overseeing an "impartial and appropriate" investigation of a discrimination complaint and, if the complainant elects a final agency decision, an impartial decision on that complaint. On the other hand, the agency head has an obligation to protect the agency from unwarranted fiscal liability. These competing principles have set up a debate in the EEO community about the proper role of agency defense counsel during the counseling and investigative segments of the complaint process. Once the complaint moves to the hearing or appellate stage, a true adversarial proceeding develops and the complaint will be decided by a neutral, i.e., the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">One school of thought is that agency defense counsel have no role in the counseling and investigative phases of the complaint process, except representing the agency in settlement negotiations and drafting and review of any resulting agreement. Those who advocate this position, including the author, point to the conflict between the role of agency defense counsel in protecting the agency from liability and the agency head's responsibility to ensure an "impartial and appropriate" investigation of a complaint and an unbiased final agency decision, if necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">The other school of thought would place no restrictions on the role of agency defense counsel during the counseling and investigative phases. Those advocating this position point to the responsibility of the agency head to protect the agency from unwarranted fiscal liability, including liability in discrimination complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2018, the Commission explicitly held that agency counsel impermissibly interfered with the EEO investigation by assisting agency witnesses with their affidavits during the investigation and accompanying the alleged discriminating official to an investigative interview in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. GSA</span>, 0120170991 (2018) (<span class="Italic">Annalee D. I</span>). Imposing sanctions, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that OGC's actions undermined the integrity of the EEO process by eroding the necessary separation of the investigative process from the Agency's defensive functions. Further, the fact that OGC reviewed multiple employees' witness statements indicates that the Agency has a practice of subjecting witness statements to OGC review during the investigation. Additionally, we find the Agency OGC's involvement in the informal stage to be an extraordinarily bold and egregious intrusion into the early stages of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Within a year, the Commission vacated its decision in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. I</span>, acknowledging that there is no "bright line" rule regarding the extent to which agency counsel may be involved in the counseling and investigative stages of the EEO process in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. General Services Administration</span>, 2019000778 (2019) (<span class="Italic">Annalee D. II</span>), and issued the most significant case decided on the subject. Citing the "interference principle," the Commission expressly held "that MD-110 permits agency defense counsel to participate in the pre-complaint and investigative stages under clearly defined and controlled conditions that <span id="Page_646"></span>will carry out the Agency Head's obligation to defend the Agency against legal challenges while avoiding inappropriate interference with the activities of the EEO Office." The Commission in expounded in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. II</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented is whether the underlying appellate decision involved clearly erroneous interpretations of material fact or law when it found that the Agency had undermined the integrity of the EEO process by allowing attorneys from the Office of General Counsel to assist management officials during the pre-hearing stages of the EEO process.</p>

General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120170991 (October 10, 2018), the Commission affirmed the Agency's final decision finding no discrimination because Complainant failed to prove that the Agency's articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons were pretext for unlawful discrimination. While the Commission did not find discrimination on the merits of Complainant's underlying claims, the Commission nevertheless determined that the Agency's Office of General Counsel (OGC) had acted improperly during the pre-hearing stages of the EEO process by assisting management officials and other witnesses in the preparation of their affidavits. The Commission concluded that OGC's involvement in the pre-hearing stages constituted egregious conduct, which warranted sanctions to protect the integrity of the EEO process and to preserve the necessary firewall between the Agency's EEO program and the defensive functions of the Agency's OGC. As such, the Commission ordered the Agency to take the following remedial action:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Agency shall provide at least four hours of in-person training to its EEO management officials and personnel in its Office of General Counsel regarding their responsibilities concerning EEO case processing and the appropriate role of the Office of General Counsel in the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency timely filed a request for reconsideration of the Commission's decision. In its request for reconsideration, the Agency does not dispute the Commission's finding of no discrimination regarding the merits of Complainant's underlying claims. Rather, the Agency objects to only the portions of the decision that found it had improperly assisted management officials during the counseling and investigative stages of the EEO process and that it should be sanctioned for that assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that Commission erred in finding that it had improperly assisted management officials and other witnesses during the pre-hearing stages of the EEO process. In this regard, the Agency asserts that the Commission's Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110) and appellate decisions do not clearly establish that agencies are prohibited from providing representation to its agents during EEO investigations. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Overview of the Concept of Conflict of Interest in the Federal Sector</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">Annalee D</span>., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, addresses, in part, what may be referred to as an "interference" principle. This principle is addressed in MD-110, Chapter 1, &#x00A7; IV, "Avoiding Conflicts of Interest" and encompasses two important concepts. First, agency heads must not permit agency defense counsel to interfere with the investigation and deliberations of the EEO Office. Second, there should be separation or distance between an agency's EEO function and its defensive function to "enhanc[e] the credibility of the [agency's] EEO Office and the integrity of the EEO complaints process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; IV.D. 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The interference principle is of critical concern in the federal sector EEO complaint process because agency heads must fulfill two potentially conflicting obligations regarding their handling of employment discrimination claims. Agency heads, on the one hand, have a duty to eliminate prohibited employment discrimination within their respective agencies. On the other hand, agency heads also have an obligation to defend their agencies against legal challenges, including charges of discrimination. Pursuant to the federal anti-discrimination laws, the agency head is the defendant in all employment discrimination lawsuits in the federal courts. These competing principles come into play in the dual roles the agency head performs through the EEO Office and agency defense counsel. The EEO Office carries out the Agency Head's statutory obligation to investigate complaints, determine their validity following an investigation or hearing, and order corrective action when appropriate. The role of agency defense counsel is to carry out the Agency Head's obligation to defend the Agency against legal challenges, including EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; IV.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In recognizing the disparate yet vital responsibilities of the EEO Office and agency defense counsel, MD-110 recognizes that these entities will inevitably interact with each other. MD-110 sets out the parameters for these interactions and seeks to ensure that neither entity inappropriately interferes with the functions of the other. One purpose of the interference principle is to ensure that agency defense counsels do not exercise any functions that are committed to the EEO Office. For example, as stated in Chapter 1, &#x00A7; IV.D of MD-110, "the agency representative may not conduct legal sufficiency reviews of EEO matters such as acceptance/dismissal of complaints, legal theories utilized by the EEO Office during investigations, and legal determinations made in final agency actions" Agency defense counsels also may not direct, control, interfere with, or overrule the activities of the EEO Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Our Holding in the Underlying Appellate Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120170991 appears to set forth an absolute rule that prohibits agency defense counsel from participating in the pre-hearing stages of equal employment opportunity matters. While the Commission has long emphasized the importance of a firewall between the investigative functions of the Agency's EEO program and the defensive functions of agency defense counsel, we find that the actions taken by the agency defense counsel in this case did not violate the firewall between the two functions. Indeed, nothing contained in MD-110 explicitly prohibits agency defense counsel from representing an agency manager during the counseling stage or bans agency defense counsel during the investigative stage from assisting an agency manager in preparing his or her affidavit or acting as a representative under the appropriate circumstances. There is no "bright line" regarding the extent to which agency defense counsel may be involved during the pre-hearing stages of the EEO process. Rather, the issue of utmost concern to the Commission is whether the actions of agency defense counsel improperly interfered with or negatively influenced the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Tammy S</span>., we provided examples of actions that could improperly interfere with or negatively influence the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Tammy S. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120084008 (June 6, 2014). In that case, the Office of General Counsel pre-interviewed witnesses prior to their interviews with the EEO investigator and attempted to intimidate complainant by threatening to cancel her pre-approved leave when scheduling her deposition. In imposing sanctions against the agency, we emphasized that it is one thing for an Office of General Counsel to take seriously its duty to zealously represent its client agency in the course of defending an EEO complaint, but it is another thing entirely to intimidate a complainant and her witnesses, and to potentially affect the course of the investigation by discouraging employee participation in the official business of the agency in investigating and resolving complaints of unlawful employment discrimination. We sanctioned the agency because the record showed that agency defense counsel improperly interfered with or negatively influenced the EEO process by engaging in conduct discouraging participation in official business, i.e., an EEO investigation. We determined such conduct to be egregious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Absent such egregious conduct, however, we have traditionally declined to impose sanctions where agency defense counsel only assisted in the development of affidavits during the EEO investigation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rucker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082225 (February 4, 2011), where the complainant contended that the agency's Office of General Counsel improperly injected itself into the EEO investigation by reviewing and assisting in the development of management officials' statements before submitting them to the EEO investigator, we expressly refused to address this contention. Rather, we merely reminded the agency of its obligation to protect the integrity of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hortencia R. v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150228 (May 3, 2017), the complainant alleged that the agency's Office of General Counsel had improperly injected itself into the EEO investigation by reviewing and assisting in the development of management officials' statements before submitting them to the EEO investigator. The agency, in response, stated in that its legal representatives had informed the selecting officials that their affidavits "appeared in places to be identical, and that [the EEO Investigator] may have "cut and paste[d]" some of [the Group Supervisor's] to [the Selecting Official's] affidavit." The Agency noted that the selecting officials thereafter revised their affidavits in places to reflect what they had actually told the EEO investigator but left some responses intact because they were truthful, accurate, and based on personal knowledge. There was insufficient evidence to show that the agency had improperly interfered with or negatively influenced the EEO process. We again declined to address the agency's actions and merely reminded the agency of its obligation to protect the integrity of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, although we previously found that the Agency's Office of General Counsel acted egregiously by assisting agency management officials during the pre-hearing stages of the EEO process, upon further consideration, we find that such determination involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law. In the underlying appellate decision, we found impermissible interference solely on the grounds that agency defense counsel provided assistance to management officials during the investigative stage and not because the provided assistance actually interfered with the EEO Office's investigative process. Unlike the facts in <span class="Italic">Tammy S. supra</span>, there is no evidence in this <span id="Page_647"></span>case that the Agency's Office of General Counsel improperly intruded upon, interfered with, or negatively influenced the EEO process. We find that the facts in this case are more akin to <span class="Italic">Rucker, supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Hortencia R., supra</span>, where the Commission did not fault agency defense counsel for assisting in the development of affidavits during the EEO investigation. In this regard, the record in the instant case shows that the investigator was able to obtain affidavits from each of the agency management officials and witnesses he or she identified. The record also shows that the Agency's Office of General Counsel, in representing the Agency's interests, did not impermissibly interfere with the investigator's activities, such as by formulating the questions asked by the investigator, altering or withholding statements/records from management officials/witnesses, limiting the individuals whom the investigator could interview or otherwise directing the investigator on how to proceed. We conclude that the underlying appellate decision improperly found that the ordinary exercise of the functions of agency defense counsel constituted egregious conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So that our position is clear, we expressly hold that MD-110 permits agency defense counsel to participate in the pre-complaint and investigative stages under clearly defined and controlled conditions that will carry out the Agency Head's obligation to defend the Agency against legal challenges while avoiding inappropriate interference with the activities of the EEO Office. This means that agency defense counsel may assist agency management officials and witnesses in the preparation of their affidavits during the investigative stage. However, agency defense counsel may not instruct officials to make statements that are untrue or make changes to any affidavit without the affiant's approval of such changes. Agencies may also be assisted by agency defense counsel in informal resolution talks during the counseling stage so long as agency defense counsel suggests, but does not dictate, settlement terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that there are a number of other activities that agency defense counsels could engage in during the pre-hearing stages that may impermissibly interfere with the pre-hearing EEO process and may not be proper or necessary to competently defend the agency. Rather than address these hypothetical activities, we have limited our analysis to the actions of agency defense counsel in the underlying case. We also do not address the Agency's other contentions regarding the propriety of our decision to impose sanctions because we have already determined that the underlying appellate decision involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law on that issue for the reasons noted above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reconsidering the previous decision and the entire record, the Commission finds that the agency's request meets the criteria of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(c), and it is the decision of the Commission to GRANT the request and VACATE the imposition of sanctions. The decision of the Commission in Appeal No. 0120170991 is MODIFIED to reflect our holding herein. There is no further right of administrative appeal on the decision of the Commission on a Request to Reconsider.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kylee C. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 2020001154 (2021), the investigator held a fact-finding conference (FFC) and gave both parties an opportunity to submit documentation. The complainant and agency were represented by counsel at the FFC. Agency counsel's participation in <span class="Italic">Kylee C.</span> was far more involved than agency counsel's in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. II</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The transcript reveals that the investigator elicited statements from each witness using a question-and-answer format. After eliciting a statement from an individual witness, the investigator gave counsel for Complainant an opportunity to have the witness add to their statement by asking follow-up questions, and then gave Agency counsel the same opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unprompted, the AJ issued a show cause order requiring the agency to establish that agency counsel's involvement in the FFC did not violate the rule against intrusion into the EEO investigative process. In particular, the AJ noted that the agency counsel who participated in the FFC also represented the agency before the Commission. The agency in <span class="Italic">Kylee C.</span> defended its actions as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency argued that since the DoD Investigations and Resolutions Directorate is fully independent and separate from the Army and decides which investigator to assign and how to conduct the investigation without Agency supervision, this separates the Agency's representative from the EEO investigatory functions. It argued that while the transcript showed the Agency counsel actively participated in the FFC, this did not constitute an improper intrusion of the Agency's defensive function into the EEO investigation because the investigator was fully independent from the Agency and its counsel, and all parties were treated equally. The Agency also argued that using the same person to represent the Agency at the FFC and before the AJ did not constitute an intrusion because the investigator was fully independent.</p>
<p class="noindent">The AJ found that agency counsel's involvement in the FFC violated the rule against intrusion in <span class="Italic">Kylee C</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receipt of the Agency's arguments, the AJ issued a decision concluding that the investigative function is the responsibility of the Agency regardless of the entity that actually performed the investigation and the Agency cannot use the DoD Investigations and Resolutions Directorate as a shield to "launder" improper intrusions/actions by Agency representatives. The AJ identified Agency counsel's intrusions at the FFC as "cross examining" Complainant (asking her questions), "speaking objections" (asking if a comparator's appraisal was relevant), commenting on testimony (apparently by saying it was okay to allow leeway with hearsay), and "directing" the method of providing documents to the investigator (asking the human resources witness to coordinate gathering the documents requested by the investigator and Complainant's attorney so that multiple Agency staff were not fulfilling the same document request), which the AJ viewed as potentially limiting the gathering of relevant documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also identified as potential Agency intrusions actions by Complainant's attorney at the FFC--her questioning witnesses and making "objection[s]" based on hearsay and relevance. The AJ found that the actions of Complainant's attorney were a foreseeable result of convening the FFC without appropriate safeguards and that the investigator--and therefore the Agency--failed to regain control of the FFC and return it to its investigative function, but rather allowed to devolve to a "quasi-mini-hearing" by permitting the representatives of Complainant and the Agency to question witnesses as if at a trial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the AJ concluded that Agency counsel's participation in the FFC and before the AJ violated the requirement that the Agency keep its investigatory and defensive functions separate. Likewise, the AJ found that DoD's A Participant's Guide to Fact-Finding Conferences in Complaint Investigations needed to be updated to ban such intrusions. In support of the above findings, the AJ cited to language in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. General Services Administration</span> (<SPAN CLASS="ITALIC">GSA</SPAN>), EEOC Appeal No. 0120170991 (Oct. 10, 2018) that the "agency representative should not have a role in shaping the testimony of witnesses or the evidence gathered by the EEO investigator," which occurred in that case when agency counsel accompanied a supervisor accused of discrimination to an EEO investigative interview.</p>
<p class="noindent">The AJ imposed the following sanctions: two hours of training for agency counsel and the investigator on MD-110 rules; ordered the agency to update its investigator's manual to comply with MD-110; and replace agency counsel with one who did not participate in the investigative process. The Commission decided <span class="Italic">Annalee D. II</span> shortly after the AJ's decision and the agency appealed. Applying the "interference principal" set forth in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. II</span>, the Commission found no intrusion and upheld the agency's final action rejecting the imposition of sanctions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Essentially, the AJ found that the DoD's Investigations and Resolutions Directorate investigator holding a "quasi-mini-hearing" (the FFC) with the participation of both Agency and Complainant's legal counsel was an intrusion of the Agency's defensive function into the EEO investigation violating EEO MD-110, at 1–9, Chap. 1, &#x00A7; IV.D. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), at 1–9, Chap. 1, &#x00A7; IV.D (REV. Aug. 5, 2015) requires that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Heads of agencies must manage the dual obligations of carrying out fair and impartial investigations of complaints...[of] discrimination...and defending the agency against claims of employment discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...[A] clear separation between the agency's EEO complaint program and the agency's defensive function is thus the essential underpinning of a fair and impartial investigation, enhancing the...integrity of the EEO complaints process....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEO MD-110 goes on to explicitly permit an EEO investigator to collect and discover factual information by being "a presiding official at a fact-finding conference." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 6-6, Chap. 6, &#x00A7; V.B. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(b). The "presiding" of an investigator at an FFC anticipates that someone other than the investigator is asking questions. The most obvious "someone" is the parties. Thus, the question to be determined is whether or not the participation of legal counsel from either party should be allowed at a fact-finding conference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that permitting Complainant's counsel at the FFC to ask witnesses follow-up questions after the EEO investigator elicited a statement from each witness, as well as questioning the admissibility of testimony, did not constitute an improper intrusion of the Agency's defensive function into the EEO investigation. In sum, we fail to see how Complainant's attorney has anything to do with the Agency's defensive function. Moreover, our regulations explicitly provide that at "any stage in the processing of a complaint...the complainant shall have the right to be accompanied, represented, and advised by a representative of complainant's choice."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the participation of Agency counsel in a fact-finding <span id="Page_648"></span>conference, we look to <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. GSA</span>, EEOC Request No. 2019000778 (Nov. 27, 2019), issued after the AJ's decision, which contains an extensive discussion of the Agency attorney intrusion issues. In recognizing the disparate yet vital responsibilities of the agency's EEO office and agency defense counsel, EEO MD-110, at 1–9, Chap. 1, &#x00A7; IV.D recognized these entities will inevitably interact with each other. EEO MD-110 sets out the parameters for these interactions and seeks to ensure that neither entity inappropriately interferes with the functions of the other. The Commission found that its prior <span class="Italic">Annalee D</span>. decision set forth an absolute rule prohibiting agency defense counsel from participating in the pre-hearing stages of EEO matters, including the investigation. In reconsidering this decision, the Commission found nothing in MD-110 explicitly bans agency defense counsel from assisting an agency manager in the preparation of their affidavit during an investigation or acting as a legal representative for the Agency under the appropriate circumstances. Rather, the issue of utmost concern to the Commission is whether the actions of agency defense counsel improperly interfered with or negatively influenced the EEO process, such as formulating the questions asked by the investigator, altering or withholding statements/records from management officials/witnesses, instructing officials to make untrue statements, or changing any affidavit without the affiant's approval of such changes, and limiting the individuals whom the investigator can interview. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these standards to the instant case, we find that the structure of the DoD Directorate's FFC, as set forth in its participant's guide and implemented here, does not breach the requirement that the Agency maintain a proper separation between the Agency's defensive and EEO investigatory functions. As ruled in EEOC Request No. 2019000778, there is no absolute rule that prohibits agency defense counsel from participating in the pre-hearing stages of EEO matters, including the investigation. Agency counsel and investigators are cautioned however that the decision in <span class="Italic">Annalee D</span>., Request 2019000778, limited that participation. The agency's own guidance on FFCs explicitly states that the investigator "conducts and controls" the FFC and Agency counsel's role is limited to soliciting clarifying information from witnesses called and questioned by the investigator as deemed appropriate by the investigator. The investigator and EEO officials maintain primary responsibility for developing the impartial record necessary for a final agency decision. If such a record is not developed and a hearing before an EEOC AJ is requested, the Commission's regulations provide that the AJ will supplement the record. In this appeal, however, the AJ and the Commission determined that the record, as developed during the investigation, was sufficiently developed for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's determination concerning possible intrusion by Agency counsel must be made on a case-by-case basis. We find no evidence of improper intrusion by the Agency's legal counsel at this FFC. The record, which includes the transcript of the FFC, shows that none of the actions by Agency counsel directed, controlled, interfered with, or overruled the investigator. The AJ's finding to the contrary does not account for all the work done by DoD's Directorate prior to the FFC to secure the relevant comprehensive documents, soliciting both parties to name relevant witnesses with a brief explanation of their expected testimony, and giving both parties the opportunity to submit additional documentation. It also does not account for the investigator at the FFC first eliciting a statement from each witness using a question and answer format, thereby creating a record regarding that witness' testimony before giving legal counsels for Complainant and the Agency the opportunity to ask follow-up questions. Likewise, we disagree with the AJ that Agency counsel's "speaking objections" (rhetorically asking if the comparator's appraisal was relevant), commenting on testimony (apparently suggesting that it was okay to allow leeway with hearsay), or attempting to facilitate the provision of documents to the investigator (asking the human resources witness to coordinate gathering the documents requested by the investigator and Complainant's attorney) were intrusions of the Agency's defensive function into its EEO program. At any point during the FFC, the investigator could have shut either counsel down if their conduct interfered with the development of an impartial record.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lino L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000541 (2021), the complainant sought a waiver of attorney-client privilege and work-product, citing to the agency attorney's involvement in the pre-complaint process. The Commission described the alleged interference:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that the AJ improperly denied Complainant's motion to compel email communications involving Agency personnel and the Office of General Counsel Attorney (OGC Attorney). Complainant claims that the OGC Attorney stepped out of his role as an attorney and into the role of Responsible Management Official (RMO) by making the decision to terminate Complainant and directing management officials to carry it out.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, Complainant claims that the OGC Attorney, during the pre-complaint process, "dug up evidence, had discussions which involved Agency personnel and even pointedly questioned [Complainant] about his disabilities during an EEO Counseling session and then used [Complainant's] answers as a basis for decision to terminate." Because Complainant asserts that the OGC Attorney acted more as an RMO than attorney, Complainant asserts that email communications involving the OGC Attorney and Agency personnel were not privileged communications and could have been produced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding no intrusion in <span class="Italic">Lino L</span>., the Commission concluded that the agency attorney was only involved in settlement discussions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we address Complainant's contention of improper interference by the Agency's OGC Attorney during the EEO pre-complaint process warranting a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine. Here, the record indicates the OGC Attorney was a member of the First Opportunity Risk Evaluation (FORE) Unit which was responsible for the preliminary resolution of EEO cases. In this role, the OGC Attorney contacted the Agency to determine if a settlement agreement was an option. Additionally, the record indicates that the OGC Attorney was present during an initial scheduling conference for Complainant along with the District Reasonable Accommodation Committee (DRAC) Chairperson, and the Agency's EEO Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Specialist to determine whether to Complainant wanted to proceed through the DRAC process or through the EEO Redress process. The record further indicates that the OGC Attorney's remaining involvement with Complainant's complaint consisted of requesting and submitting the MRQ to his client. Significantly, the OGC Attorney testified in his deposition that he was not involved in the decision to terminate Complainant's employment. Upon review, we find that the OGC Attorney participated solely in informal resolution talks during the counseling stage which did not constitute inappropriate interference on the part of the Office of General Counsel. <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120170991 (Oct.10, 2018), <span class="Italic">req. for recons. granted</span>, EEOC Request No. 2019000778 (Nov. 27, 2019).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant solely based his argument for waiver of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine, by alleging that the OGC Attorney improperly interfered with the EEO pre-complaint process. Because we have determined that the OGC Attorney did not improperly interfere, we find that Complainant no longer has a basis to support his request for waiver of attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine. Therefore, we find that the AJ properly denied his request for waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the agency in <span class="Italic">Larraine D. v. Agency for International Development</span>, 2020003744 (2021), overreached where "metadata" revealed that the agency's final decision, finding no discrimination, "appear[ed] to be the product of the Agency's Office of General Counsel rather than the Agency's EEO office." Requesting that the agency be sanctioned, the complainants further noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[D]espite the fact that the decisions are signed by the Agency's EEO Deputy Director, the metadata[3] for each decision identifies the Agency's Attorney Representative in this matter as the author of the decisions. Complainants attach screenshots of the metadata from the decisions in support of their position. Complainants argue there is no reason for the Agency's Attorney Representative to have "fingerprints" on any aspect of the authorship of the decisions. They claim the likely scenario is that Agency Counsel was involved in the drafting of the decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;despite the fact that the decisions are signed by the Agency's EEO Deputy Director, the metadata3 for each decision identifies the Agency's Attorney Representative in this matter as the author of the decisions. Complainants attach screenshots of the metadata from the decisions in support of their position. Complainants argue there is no reason for the Agency's Attorney Representative to have "fingerprints" on any aspect of the authorship of the decisions. They claim the likely scenario is that Agency Counsel was involved in the drafting of the decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Larraine D.</span> countered that metadata only reveals the originator of the document, not the person who drafted its content; the Civil Rights office used counsel's work product but reviewed it independently; and the Acting Director of the Civil Rights office and her team wrote the final agency decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Agency states regarding a document's metadata, "the document's ‘author' refers to the original creator of the document and will continue to appear regardless of any person later making edits to the document." Further, the Agency notes that on February 12, 2020, the night before the Agency's first scheduled deposition, Complainants filed a Motion Supplementing the Record and then a Withdrawal of Request for Hearing. The AJ issued an Order of Dismissal on February 13, 2020. The Agency states once Complainants withdrew their hearing requests, its Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD) became responsible for "a Herculean task"--to, within 30 days (later extended to 60 days), review thousands of pages of new discovery and issue four decisions, explaining the Agency's obscure pay systems; setting forth the lengthy pay histories of Complainants and the three cited comparatives for each Complainant; and setting forth the relevant law and applying it to the extensive facts of these cases. The Agency explains that at that point, "given the short <span id="Page_649"></span>deadline for the four [decisions] and tremendous volume and complexity of material involved, and as GC [Office of General Counsel] had already spent fourteen months reviewing and analyzing over 15,000 pages of discovery, GC agreed to provide, and OCRD agreed to accept, GC's work product in the case (including facts, law, and analysis) for review." The Agency maintains OCRD staff reviewed GC's work product independently, including reviewing the record, checking facts for accuracy, and checking for proper legal support. The Agency argues that "OCRD appropriately reviewed GC's work product in issuing independent [final agency decisions] that it-OCRD-found to support the conclusions." The Agency provided several declarations in support of its brief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Acting Director, OCRD, (Acting Director) noted in his declaration that in this situation, as with any final decision OCRD must issue, the Chief, Complaints and Resolution Team, (Chief) and her team were responsible for preparing the decisions for the three Complainants. The Acting Director noted that the EEO Compliance Officer assisted the Chief with the decisions. The Acting Director explained that he had learned that GC had performed substantial work on the cases during litigation, and he "agreed that GC could provide its work to OCRD." The Acting Director stated that the Chief and the Compliance Officer received GC's work and reviewed and checked the work. He stated that after the Chief and Compliance Officer completed the decisions, they provided the decisions for him to review and sign. The Acting Director stated that he reviewed the decisions in their entirety to determine there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusions reached. He noted after his review of the decisions, he had questions which resulted in discussion with the Chief and the Compliance Officer. He stated that after his questions were answered, he reviewed the decisions again and was comfortable that the evidence supported the conclusions. Thus, he signed the decisions for issuance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his declaration, the EEO Compliance Officer stated that in addition to other roles, he is "responsible for writing Final Agency Decisions ‘from scratch.'" The Compliance Officer explained he had played an extensive role early in these cases and had compiled the four reports of investigation for the then-four Complainants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Compliance Officer noted that on February 12, 2020, Complainants filed a motion supplementing the record with 785 pages and on March 20, 2020, the Agency submitted a supplement to their case, containing 5,599 pages. The Compliance Officer stated that by February 20, 2020, the Agency Representative from GC had drafted a motion for summary judgment. He stated that in April and May 2020, the Agency Representative provided her work product to OCRD. He noted the "GC work product contained an assessment of the case, including facts, legal citations, and a legal analysis." The Compliance Officer explained that he and the Chief reviewed the GC work product. He stated they each initially reviewed the work product in full and "then more narrowly focused on drafting and/or revising the different sections that would appear in the [final decision]." The Compliance Officer averred that he examined the work product inquiring whether the facts were accurately stated; reviewed the legal analysis for accuracy; considered counterpoints; and examined whether the conclusion was correct. He said that in helping draft OCRD's decisions, he took notes, exchanged comments and sections he had drafted with the Chief. He stated that both he and the Chief made changes to the GC work product. He contended that the "GC work product was a means of saving OCRD some of the heavy workload in drafting four [decisions] in a complex matter and avoiding the duplication of work." The Compliance Officer noted that after he completed his review, the Acting Director, in consultation with the Chief, made the final decision on the content of the final decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her declaration, the Chief noted in February or March 2020, the Agency Representative informed the Acting Director and the Chief that she (the Agency Representative) had compiled extensive information on the cases and could provide what she had to OCRD. The Chief stated that as OCRD was short-staffed at the time and given the cases were complicated, the Acting Director told the Agency Representative that she could provide her work. The Chief averred the Compliance Officer remained responsible for the primary review of the decision and as such, he "was primarily responsible for the editing and final draft." The Chief explained her role was to conduct a secondary review of the decisions. She stated in April and May 2020, the Agency Representative sent her the work she had performed which contained the facts and a legal analysis of each Complainant's claims. The Chief stated that after she received the Agency Representative's work product, she shared it with the Compliance Officer. The Chief maintained she reviewed the record, the case law, and inserted missing information. The Chief stated she had discussions with the Compliance Officer "regarding the GC analysis, the law, and the facts at issue." The Chief also stated that she and the Compliance Officer met with the Acting Director to present alternative viewpoints and to answer questions from the Acting Director.</p>
<p class="noindent">Vacating the final agency decision, in <span class="Italic">Larraine D</span>., the Commission found that using counsel's work product compromised the Civil Rights office's impartiality:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the Agency's OCRD failed to maintain its impartiality in drafting the final decisions in Complainants' cases. The OCRD acknowledged that after the complaints were returned to the Agency for issuance of final decisions, it accepted the work product of the Agency's GC which contained facts, legal citations, and a legal analysis. In his declaration, the Acting Director admitted that he agreed that GC could provide its work product to OCRD. The record is clear that the Chief and the Compliance Officer received GC's work product, reviewed it, and relied upon it in drafting the final decisions at issue. We find the actions by the OCRD in accepting the work product of its GC as a starting point for issuing its final decision to impinge the integrity of the EEO decision-making process. Because impartiality and the appearance of impartiality is paramount to the credibility of the equal employment program, we find the actions by the OCRD in this case improper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also relevant here, is the interference principle which is addressed in MD-110, Chapter 1, IV, "Avoiding Conflicts of Interest" and encompasses two important concepts. First, agency heads must not permit agency defense counsel to interfere with the investigation and deliberations of the EEO Office. Second, there should be separation or distance between an agency's EEO function and its defensive function to "enhanc[e] the credibility of the [agency's] EEO Office and the integrity of the EEO complaints process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; IV.D</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has recognized the interference principle is of critical concern in the federal sector EEO complaint process because Agency heads must fulfill two potentially conflicting obligations regarding the handling of employment discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 2019000778 (November 27, 2019). Agency heads, on the one hand, have a duty to eliminate prohibited employment discrimination within their respective agencies. On the other hand, agency heads also have an obligation to defend their agencies against legal challenges, including charges of discrimination. Pursuant to the federal antidiscrimination laws, the agency head is the defendant in all employment discrimination lawsuits in the federal courts. These competing principles come into play in the dual roles the agency head performs through the EEO Office and agency defense counsel. The EEO Office carries out the agency head's statutory obligation to investigate complaints, determine their validity following an investigation or hearing, and order corrective action when appropriate. The role of agency defense counsel is to carry out the agency head's obligation to defend the agency against legal challenges, including EEO complaints. MD-110 at &#x00A7; IV.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In recognizing the disparate yet vital responsibilities of the EEO Office and agency defense counsel, MD-110 recognizes that these entities will inevitably interact with each other. MD-110 sets out the parameters for these interactions and seeks to ensure that neither entity inappropriately interferes with the functions of the other. One purpose of the interference principle is to ensure that agency defense counsels do not exercise any functions that are committed to the EEO Office. For example, as stated in Chapter 1, &#x00A7; IV.D of MD-110, "the agency representative...may not conduct legal sufficiency reviews of EEO matters...such as acceptance/dismissal of complaints, legal theories utilized by the EEO Office during investigations, and legal determinations made in final agency actions..." Agency defense counsels also may not direct, control, interfere with, or overrule the activities of the EEO Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances of how the EEO Office issued their decisions, which was not from deliberation and work independent of the defensive function of the GC, we shall vacate the Agency's decisions so the Agency's EEO Office can issue new, independently created decisions. Furthermore, we will notify Federal Sector Programs which monitors the federal agencies' EEO programs of the Agency's failure to maintain an independent EEO Office.</p>
<p class="noindent">On request for reconsideration, in <span class="Italic">Larraine D. v. Agency for International Development</span>, 2022001084 (2022), the complainants argued that the Commission's remedial order that the agency issue new final decisions "by a fair, impartial, and objective official with no interference from the Agency's Office of General Counsel" did not "serve to deter the Agency." Agencies that allow this type of interference by counsel, they argued, should be penalized. The complainants asked for sanctions in the form of legal fees. The Commission rejected the request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants timely requested that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) reconsider its consolidated decision in EEOC Appeal Nos. 2020003744, 2020003745, and 2020003746, (November 9, 2021). EEOC regulations provide that the Commission may, in its discretion, grant a request to reconsider any previous Commission decision issued pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a), where the requesting party demonstrates that: (1) the appellate decision involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law; or (2) the appellate decision will have a substantial impact on the policies, practices, or operations of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, EEOC regulations allow the Commission to <span id="Page_650"></span>consolidate two or more complaints filed by two or more complainants, consisting of substantially similar discrimination claims, or relating to the same matter. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.606. For the sake of clarity and administrative efficiency, we exercise our discretion and consolidate the above-referenced requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants joined the Foreign Service at the Agency between 1989 and 1993. At varying times in their careers, Complainants advanced from working as Foreign Service Officers to Senior Foreign Service Officers. On January 19, 2017, the three complainants each filed a formal EEO complaint claiming that the Agency continuously paid them a salary less than that paid to similarly situated men performing jobs requiring substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following an investigation, Complainants timely requested hearings before an EEOC Administrative Judge, but subsequently withdrew their requests. Thereafter, the Agency issued three final decisions, finding no discrimination was established in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., or the Equal Pay Act of 1963, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 206(d) <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The three complainants appealed. On appeal, complainants claimed, among other things, that the Agency final decisions "appear to be the product of the Agency's Office of General Counsel rather than the Agency's EEO office."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In consolidated Appeal Nos. 2020003744, 2020003745, and 2020003746, we vacated the Agency's final decisions and remanded the matter back to the Agency for further processing. Specifically, it was determined that that although the Agency's EEO Office had issued the final decisions, they did not appear to be from deliberation and work independent of the defensive function of the Agency's Office of General Counsel as required by regulation and EEOC guidance. On remand, the Agency was ordered to issue three new final decisions "by a fair, impartial, and objective official with no interference from the Agency's Office of General Counsel." In addition, the Agency was notified that the Agency's failure to maintain an independent EEO Office had been referred to EEOC's Federal Sector Programs, which provides oversight to federal agencies' EEO programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that while complainants' attorneys identify the matters raised before us as a "Request for Clarification," we conclude it is more appropriate to consider this matter as a request for reconsideration of our prior appellate decision under 29 C.F. R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants' attorneys do not dispute the Commission's findings below. However, they argue that merely directing the Agency to issue new final decisions does not serve to deter the Agency from the actions taken in its prior final decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">They expressly seek attorney's fees as a sanction following the Agency issuance of new final decisions, and further request that the Commission hold in abeyance any ruling on the amount of fees to be awarded until they can review the new final decisions and, if appropriate, file new appeals and determine how much in attorney's fees the new final decisions and appeals cost complainants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have reviewed the instant request for reconsideration and determine that there is nothing that requires expansion from, or clarification of, the Commission's prior decision. Moreover, we find it unnecessary to hold in abeyance any request for added attorney's fees. Specifically, we note that this request can readily be raised if and when appeals are filed from the new Agency final decisions. A request for reconsideration is not a second appeal to the Commission. Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), Chap. 9 &#x00A7; VI.A (Aug. 5, 2015); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Lopez v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520070736 (Aug. 20, 2007). Rather, a reconsideration request is an opportunity to demonstrate that the appellate decision involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law, or will have a substantial impact on the policies, practices, or operations of the Agency. Complainants have not done so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the previous decision and the entire record, the Commission finds that the requests fail to meet the criteria of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(c), and it is the decision of the Commission to deny the requests. The consolidated decision in EEOC Appeal Nos. 2022001084 <span class="Italic">et al</span>, remains the Commission's decision. There is no further right of administrative appeal on the decision of the Commission on this request.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Annalee D. II</span> makes clear that agency counsel may assist in the preparation of witness statements during the investigative stage. As the Commission noted, however, there are plenty other counseling and investigative activities that are also subject to the "interference principle" set forth in the 2015 MD-110 revisions, at 1-9. That guidance is, dedicated to conflicts of interest between these two competing principles, but contains surprisingly little detail on what, if any, parameters there are on the role of agency defense counsel during the counseling and investigative stages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Separation of EEO Complaint Program from Agency's Defensive Function</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heads of agencies must manage the dual obligations of carrying out fair and impartial investigations of complaints that result in final agency determinations as to whether discrimination has occurred and defending the agency against claims of employment discrimination. Only through the vigilant separation of the investigative and defensive functions can this inherent tension be managed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensuring a clear separation between the agency's EEO complaint program and the agency's defensive function is thus the essential underpinning of a fair and impartial investigation, enhancing the credibility of the EEO office and the integrity of the EEO complaints process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There must be a firewall between the EEO function and the agency's defensive function. The firewall will ensure that actions taken by the agency to protect itself from legal liability will not negatively influence or affect the agency's process for determining whether discrimination has occurred and, if such discrimination did occur, for remedying it at the earliest stage possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important for the EEO Director to be provided with sufficient legal resources (either directly or through contracts) so that the legal analyses necessary for reaching final agency decisions can be made within the autonomous EEO office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At a minimum, however, the agency representative in EEO complaints may not conduct legal sufficiency reviews of EEO matters. Legal sufficiency reviews in the EEO process involve legal analysis made by the EEO office during the processing of EEO complaints, such as acceptance/dismissal of complaints, legal theories utilized by the EEO office during investigations, and legal determinations made in final agency actions. The optimal situation is for the EEO office to have sufficient internal legal resources. However, when necessary and requested by the EEO office, legal sufficiency reviews conducted outside the EEO office must be handled by individuals that are separate and apart from the agency's defensive function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, impartiality or the appearance of impartiality is not ensured by simply rotating agency representatives within the same office and is undermined where the agency representative's associates are assigned the legal sufficiency function in EEO cases from the representative's caseload.</p>
<p class="noindent">That lack of detail is particularly surprising given the level of detail in the proposed revisions to MD-110 which contained a section with 16 questions and answers about the role of agency counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;Questions and Answers Clarifying Proper Roles of an Agency Representative[1] in the EEO Administrative Complaint Process</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;The term 'agency representative' refers to any or all agency employees whose job duties include defending the agency's personnel policies and/or actions. The term is not limited to attorneys employed in an agency's Office of General Counsel or Office of Legal Counsel. The term also includes non-attorney employees whose job duties include defending the agency's personnel policies and/or actions, for example, labor relations specialists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q1) May an agency representative participate in settlement attempts during the informal stage of the EEO process?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A1) Yes. Either party may have a representative present during settlement attempts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q2) May an agency representative accompany a management official to a meeting with an EEO Counselor concerning an informal complaint?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A2) Yes. An agency representative may accompany a management official to a meeting with an EEO Counselor at the request of the management official. The agency representative may advise the management official of his or her rights and responsibilities and represent the agency's interest in facilitating resolution of the complaint. The EEO Counselor should not defer to the counsel/representative or allow the counsel/representative to interfere in the performance of the Counselor's duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q3) May an Agency representative participate in activities conducted by the EEO Counselor during the informal process?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A3) No. Other than the situations described in Q1 and Q2, the Agency representative may not question witnesses or in any way attempt to consult/direct the EEO counseling process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q4) Is an agency representative the personal representative of the management official?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A4) No. The agency representative represents the agency. However, to the extent that management officials are acting within their official capacity and their interests are consistent with the agency's interests, the agency may permit the agency representative to provide representation to the management official during the EEO process. At no time during the EEO administrative process is an individual management official considered a party to the complaint. Rather, during the EEO administrative process, management officials are considered witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q5) May an agency representative be involved in deciding whether or not to accept a complaint for investigation?</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_651"></span>(A5) No. In order to preserve the integrity and impartiality of the EEO process, an agency representative may not be involved in deciding whether or not to accept a complaint for investigation, or to determine which bases and issues are to be accepted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q6) May an agency require the EEO office to accept legal advice from the agency representative on how to conduct an EEO investigation?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A6) No. In order to preserve the integrity and neutrality of the EEO process, the agency representative may not advise the EEO office concerning any aspect of an EEO investigation unless requested to do so by the EEO office. The EEO office must be free to follow, or reject, the advice given. Advice can be provided by an attorney within the EEO office or an attorney in a unit separate and apart from the unit that provides representation to the agency. However, it would be a conflict, for example, for the individual who represented the agency in an EEO hearing to subsequently play a role in decisions with respect to EEO investigations involving the same complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q7) May an agency representative review documents during the investigation?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A7) Generally, no. The investigative process is a non-adversarial fact finding process. The role of the investigator in gathering information concerning the claim(s) in the complaint is to obtain unbiased, objective, and impartial information and facts regarding the allegations. The investigator has discretion to determine what documents and information would facilitate the investigation. The investigator also has the discretion to determine whether to disclose information and documents obtained during the investigation. For example, neither management officials nor agency representatives are entitled to review complainant's affidavit or the statements of other non-management witnesses unless the investigator decides that it would facilitate the investigation to disclose that information. However, if a witness is a management official, such official may consult with agency counsel for information to assist the official in responding to the inquiry. This is not, however, a requirement, and agencies must not require that management officials' investigative responses be reviewed/approved by agency counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q8) May an agency representative accompany a management official, who is alleged to have engaged in an unlawful employment action, to a meeting with an EEO Investigator?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A8) Yes. An agency representative may accompany a management official who is alleged to have engaged in an unlawful employment action to an interview with an EEO Investigator at the request of the agency or the management official. The agency representative may advise the management official of his or her rights and responsibilities and participate in efforts to resolve the complaint. The EEO Investigator should be careful not to defer to the counsel/representative during the interview. The counsel/representative should be careful not to interfere with the performance of the Investigator's duties during the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q9) May an agency representative accompany managerial agency personnel who are not the subject of the complaint to interviews with an EEO investigator?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A9) Yes. Managers can request the advice of an agency representative during EEO interviews as they can for any matters related to their performance of their official duties because managers are agency agents whose actions are legally binding on the agency. However, the agency representative does not represent the manager in his/her personal capacity; the agency representative represents the manager in the manager's official capacity only. Therefore, if a manager requests an agency representative, the agency should consider whether the agency's and manager's interests coincide. Furthermore, because the investigation of an EEO complaint is not an adversarial process, the agency representative's role during the interview is limited to advising the manager witness. The agency representative may not ask questions, make objections, or otherwise play a defensive role for the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q10)&#x2003;May an agency representative accompany non-managerial agency personnel who are not the subject of the complaint to interviews with an EEO investigator?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A10)&#x2003;No. The investigation of a complaint is not an adversarial process and there is no defensive role for the agency during the investigation. However, the witness may consult with personal counsel and bring them to the interview at their own expense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q11)&#x2003;May an agency representative make suggestions to the investigator regarding which documents to obtain or witnesses to interview?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A11)&#x2003;Yes. An agency representative and anyone else with knowledge of the matter may suggest or submit to the investigator relevant documents and witnesses. However, an agency representative cannot require the investigator to obtain certain documents or interview certain witnesses. Furthermore, an agency representative may not control the means and methods of the investigation. The means and methods of the investigation are solely within the discretion of the investigator. The investigator is obligated to collect evidence regardless of the parties' positions with respect to the items of evidence. Investigative inquiries may include any fact-finding methods that the investigator decides will efficiently and thoroughly address the matters at issue, including but not limited to: personal interviews, depositions, fact<span class="Italic">-</span>finding conferences, requests for information, position statements, exchange of letters or memoranda, interrogatories and affidavits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q12)&#x2003;May an agency representative review the affidavit of a management official who is the subject of a complaint of employment discrimination?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A12)&#x2003;Yes. Because the agency will be accountable for the actions of a management official who is the subject of a complaint of employment discrimination, an agency representative may review such management official's affidavit. However, agency representative should not direct the witness in how to respond to the questions contained in the affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q13)&#x2003;May an agency representative review and comment on a draft report of investigation (ROI)?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A13)&#x2003;Generally no. However if the EEO office affords the complainant the opportunity to review the draft ROI before it is finalized and comment on any perceived deficiencies, the agency representative may also be afforded the opportunity to review and comment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q14)&#x2003;May an agency representative review a draft of an agency's final decision on the merits of an EEO complaint before it is issued?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A14)&#x2003;No. Legal sufficiency reviews must be handled by an individual or functional unit that is separate and apart from the agency representative and his/her functional unit. Because the EEO Director is acting as an adjudicator of the complaint when s/he issues a final decision, it would be inappropriate for the agency representative to review or suggest any modifications to a draft final agency decision. An EEO Director may seek legal advice from any individual or unit that is separate and apart from the unit that handles agency representation in EEO complaints. Each agency must provide sufficient resources for its EEO office in order to ensure the legal sufficiency of its final actions. As noted above, the optimal situation is for the EEO office to have sufficient internal legal resources to draft final agency actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q15)&#x2003;May an agency representative be involved in deciding whether or not to appeal a decision issued by a Commission Administrative Judge?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A15)&#x2003;Yes. When an Administrative Judge issues a decision, the administrative EEO complaint process allows both parties to the complaint the right to appeal to the Commission. The complainant may appeal the agency's final action on the complaint, and the agency must appeal from an Administrative Judge's decision if its final order does not fully implement the decision of the Administrative Judge. Unlike the issuance of a final decision without a hearing, where a decision is issued by a Commission Administrative Judge, the agency is no longer responsible for adjudicating the complaint, but rather is determining whether, as a party to the matter, to appeal from the Administrative Judge's decision. Therefore, an agency representative cannot make the decision but may, if requested, counsel the person designated with the responsibility with deciding whether to appeal a decision by an Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Q16)&#x2003;May an agency representative be involved in deciding whether or not to request reconsideration of a decision issued by the Commission on appeal?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A16)&#x2003;Yes. For the same reasons stated in Question No. 15, an agency representative may also counsel the person who decides whether to request reconsideration of a decision issued by the Commission on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the 2015 revisions to MD-110, the Commission passed up a chance for further guidance in <span class="Italic">Rucker v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0129982225 (2010), where the complainant alleged that agency counsel interfered in the EEO process by reviewing and assisting in the preparation of management affidavits for the report of investigation. The complainant also alleged that the Office of General Counsel directed witnesses to give responses to investigator interrogatories in narrative form, "which portrays the Agency's actions in the most favorable light." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rucker</span>, sidestepped any ruling on the specific claims made by the complainant and instead issued the following general admonition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not make any findings with regard to this contention. We note, however, that Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110), Chapter 1, &#x00A7; III states the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Heads of agencies must not permit intrusion on the investigations and deliberations of EEO complaints by agency representatives and offices responsible for defending the agency against EEO complaints. Maintaining distance between the fact-finding and defensive functions of the agency enhances the credibility of the EEO office and the integrity of the EEO complaints process. Legal sufficiency reviews of EEO matters must be handled by a functional unit that is separate and apart from the unit which handles agency <span id="Page_652"></span>representation in EEO complaints. The Commission requires this separation because impartiality and the appearance of impartiality is important to the credibility of the equal employment program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We remind the Agency that it should be careful to avoid even the appearance that it is interfering with the EEO process. Participants in EEO investigations should be assured that they can give candid, truthful responses to investigators. Further, we note that the extent to which respondents have been prompted or instructed to give certain testimony by employer representatives can go the heart of the witness's credibility. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Arias-Santos,</span> 39 F.3d 1070, 1074 (10th Cir. 1994) (questions directed at revealing testimony of witness was coached clearly relevant to jury's assessment of reliability of that witness). Consequently, we urge the Agency to henceforth avoid actions that might create the appearance that it is influencing employees' responses to EEO investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The equivocal nature of the <span class="Italic">Rucker</span> decision gave both sides fuel for the fire. Those advocating restrictions on agency defense counsel argued that the Commission's warning meant it deemed the agency's actions improper. Those against such restrictions argued that the Commission deemed the actions proper as no sanction was levied.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120084008 (2014), the Commission found that the Office of General Counsel had acted improperly when it interviewed witnesses prior to their investigative interviews, including the employee accused of sexual harassment and harassment based on reprisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant claims that the Office of General Counsel impermissibly interfered with the development of the record, and acted improperly, when it was permitted to question the witnesses in the complaint prior to their investigative interviews. She argued that the Office of General Counsel effectively "represented" GW and his interests during the investigation when it prepared GW for two hours before, and represented him during, his investigative interview. She claims that the Office of General Counsel threatened to cancel her pre-approved annual leave when scheduling her deposition toward the end of the discovery period, in an effort to intimidate her and retaliate against her. According to Complainant, she and her attorney offered to extend the discovery period, but the Agency declined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's barely-concealed disdain for Complainant is evident in its filings before this Commission on appeal and before the AJ. It is one thing for an Office of General Counsel to take seriously its duty to zealously represent its client agency in the course of defending an EEO complaint. It is another thing entirely to use the power of its office to intimidate a complainant and her witnesses, and to potentially affect the course of the investigation by pre-interviewing witnesses during the EEO investigation. The Agency's circular logic that it needed to interview the witnesses before the EEO investigator did, because the investigator did not know what the witnesses were going to testify to, is a self-serving justification for its actions. The EEO investigator is responsible for the development of an impartial record. It is in this role that the investigator would pursue the appropriate line of questioning of each witness. An agency representative should not step into the process until it becomes adversarial, either through the request for a hearing or the filing of an appeal. We find that the Agency acted with gross impropriety in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's actions warrant a sanction in this instance. The Commission found in the case of <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (September 25, 2009) that delays in completing the Report of Investigation beyond the 180-day regulatory time frame warranted a sanction. In Royal, we held that "the agency's delay in completing the investigation within the 180-day regulatory period is no small non-compliance matter." Similarly, in this case, the Agency took nearly 11 months to issue a final agency decision on the record once Complainant withdrew her hearing request. Incredibly, the Agency argued that it was the aggrieved party, harmed by Complainant's withdrawal of her hearing request, presumably because it did not have the benefit of an AJ's decision to implement or reject, and instead had to write a final decision on the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's failure to comply with either the spirit or the letter of the specific directives contained in the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 regulations to be inexplicable and inexcusable. Our regulations require agency action in a timely manner at many points in the EEO process. Compliance with these timeframes is not optional. As the Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs, supra</span>, "the Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party and must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations." We further noted in Royal that when weighing the factors pertinent to tailoring an appropriate sanction, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process and protecting that process, is of "paramount" importance to the "Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." The Agency should consider itself on notice that future noncompliance with our regulations could subject it to the imposition of more stringent sanctions than those we impose here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case of <span class="Italic">Talahongva-Adams v. Department of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081694 (May 28, 2010), we found that the agency's failure to comply with the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 regulations and failure to adhere to the process for properly processing a complaint warranted a sanction. In addition to the default judgment levied by the AJ in that case, we found that the agency's failure to properly implement the AJ's decision, to submit the complaint file to the Commission on appeal, or even to submit a brief to the Commission on appeal in a manner in accordance with the regulations, had a serious effect on the integrity of the EEO process. In that case, we ordered the EEO personnel at the Agency to undergo training in their responsibilities in the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a similar sanction is warranted here. The EEO Office's and Office of General Counsel's disregard for the basic principles of neutrality and fairness which are required to fairly adjudicate an EEO complaint is clear. The actions of the Office of General Counsel in particular evidence contempt and disrespect for the EEO process, and its pervasive presence in the investigative process casts doubt on whether the investigation was fair and impartial. Therefore, we find that it would benefit these Agency personnel to undergo training in the EEO process, and the roles and responsibilities of an agency EEO office and of its legal representative, so that the Agency may better carry out the shared mission of all federal agencies and the Commission to eradicate discrimination in federal employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission discussed legal sufficiency reviews by agency counsel during the investigative stage in <span class="Italic">Hortencia R. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120150228 (2017), where the complainant alleged that agency counsel had improperly injected itself into the investigation by reviewing management's statements and assisting in the development of same prior to submission to the EEO investigator. The agency countered that its attorneys merely "informed the selecting officials that their affidavits appeared identical in places, and the selecting officials subsequently revised their affidavits to reflect what they actually told the investigator, but left some responses intact because they were truthful, accurate, and based on personal knowledge." Without making a finding as to the propriety of the agency's actions, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Hortencia R</span>. cautioned that the agency should "avoid actions that might create the appearance that it is influencing employees' responses to EEO investigations."</p>
