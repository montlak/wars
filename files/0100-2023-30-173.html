<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-163"><span class="space">10.</span> External Factors</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the agency asserts that other external factors caused at least some of the harm to the complainant, it is the agency's burden to prove that proposition. The agency must do more than merely assert that other factors must have been at work to cause the extent of the harm that occurred. It must present specific evidence of the external factors and the harm caused by those factors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Booker v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A00023 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1945"></span>In <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01961030 (1996), the Commission awarded $25,000 in compensatory damages where the agency's discrimination exacerbated the significant emotional distress being experienced by the complainant because of external factors. The <span class="Italic">Terrell</span> case is significant because of the extent of the complainant's external problems. A failed business, substantial debt, a diagnosis of cancer for his wife, marital problems and failing the bar exam were all factors the Commission found had actually caused the complainant's emotional distress. Nonetheless, the Commission found that the agency's discriminatory failure to temporarily promote the complainant had substantially aggravated the stress caused by these other factors.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bever v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01953949 (1996), the Commission awarded $15,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress caused by the discrimination, but declined to award additional damages for the alleged exacerbation of an existing condition. In addition to the emotional distress as the result of not being promoted, the complainant suffered from familial spastic paraplegia. The complainant alleged the condition worsened as a result of the emotional distress. However, the Commission found the complainant failed to produce evidence that the worsening of the condition was caused by the agency's discrimination as opposed to the natural progression of the disease. Quoting <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981), the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bever</span> explained there are exceptions to the general rule that a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a settled principle of tort law that when a defendant's wrongful act causes injury, he is fully liable for the resulting damage even though the injured plaintiff had a preexisting condition that made the consequences of the wrongful act more severe than they would have been for the normal victim. The defendant takes the plaintiff as he finds him. A plaintiff's recovery for damages caused by a defendant's wrongful act may not be proportionately reduced because of a preexisting weakness or susceptibility to injury such as...a weakness caused by a preexisting injury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, there are two exceptions to the general rule. First, when a plaintiff is incapacitated or disabled prior to an accident, the defendant is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation that he caused.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, when a plaintiff has a preexisting condition that would inevitably worsen, a defendant causing subsequent injury is entitled to have the plaintiff's damages discounted to reflect the proportion of damages that would have been suffered even in the absence of subsequent injury, but the burden of proof in such cases is upon the defendant to prove the extent of the damages that the preexisting condition would inevitably have caused. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 99-100.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Secretary of Agriculture,</span> 01984574 (2001), the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages where the complainant had experienced panic attacks prior to the discrimination and the agency demonstrated there were other causes of his distress:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[C]onsidering the nature and severity of the harm to the complainant, the actual duration of the harm, and limiting the award to the issue for which the agency found discrimination, we find that the complainant is entitled to an award of nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $15,000.00 for emotional distress experienced in connection with the denial of his request for a waiver of medical clearance. In so finding, the Commission notes that the record shows that complainant experienced panic attacks prior to 1992. Further, the record contains some medical evidence which indicates that the complainant's condition resulted from other factors not related to the discrimination. In addition, the evidence shows that the complainant's condition deteriorated subsequent to March 1995 in part due to the stress from pursuing his EEO complaint, and because of legal problems, such as his former spouse's suit for child support and the State Department investigation, which were unrelated to the discrimination herein<span class="Italic">. See Appleby v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933897 March 4, 1994) (complainant not entitled to compensatory damages caused by the stress of participating in the EEO process). Nevertheless, the complainant indicated that the discrimination caused him to disassociate himself from family and friends. The complainant further stated that he experienced sleeplessness, anxiety, and depression, and ultimately became unable to function. Finally, although he did not isolate the effects of the two instances of discrimination. Dr. O confirmed that complainant's condition resulted from problems related to his job.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complainant's legal marital separation began on the day after the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Commission found that no award of compensatory damages was appropriate. <span class="Italic">Bever v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01953949 (1996). The Commission found that the complainant's contention that the discrimination prevented him from focusing on reconciliation efforts was speculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the fact that a complainant's marital separation preceded the discrimination does not exempt the agency from all liability. In <span class="Italic">Millard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991535 (2001), the Commission awarded $75,000 in damages where the complainant's marriage ended several months before the discrimination and he required leave for treatment because of depression. The Commission noted the complainant's depression worsened after the discrimination and required further treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976222 (2000), the Commission awarded 75% of the complainant's therapy costs where the complainant's therapist attributed her depression equally to the loss of her job and her divorce. The Commission, in reducing the therapy costs by only 25%, credited the complainant's testimony that the loss of her job caused her divorce. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Force v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01995221 (2002) (reducing a damage award for psychiatric treatment by one-third because of external causes).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the evidence indicates that the complainant's stress was caused by being rejected for employment by the agency more than once, but only one nonselection was found to be discriminatory, damages may be awarded only for the one nonselection. In <span class="Italic">Pryor v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961884 (1998), the Commission awarded $5,000 in emotional distress damages, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the AJ, appellant presented no evidence with respect to pecuniary losses. Appellant did, however, present evidence of nonpecuniary damages. Appellant testified that as a result of his failure to be hired by the agency, he has experienced anxiety and stress. He stated that shortly after he was rejected a few times, he developed tremors. Appellant also had a heart attack in January 1995, which he attributed to the anxiety and stress he suffered. Appellant further testified that he had trouble sleeping, he lost weight, and had difficulty communicating with his adult children.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's testimony was supported by his treating psychiatrist (the Doctor), who is board-certified in both psychiatry and neurology. The Doctor has been treating appellant since December 19, 1991. The Doctor testified that he began seeing appellant to monitor appellant's psychotropic medication, which appellant takes to control his schizophrenia. The Doctor testified that appellant's frustration with not being able to be rehired by the agency has been a significant source of anxiety and stress. He testified that this anxiety and stress may have contributed to appellant's tremor. Although medication can contribute to the development of tremors, the Doctor testified that he had seen alterations in the degree of appellant's tremor without any changes made in appellant's medication. The Doctor also stated that it was quite likely that stress played a role in appellant's mild heart attack.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the agency offered no evidence to rebut the testimony of either appellant or the Doctor, we find that the evidence establishes that appellant suffered emotional harm as a result of his nonselection for the position. Accordingly, we find that appellant is entitled to an award of compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the facts of this case, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $5,000.00. In reaching this amount, the Commission has considered a number of factors. For example, we considered the nature and severity of the discrimination, as well as the nature and severity of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms. The evidence establishes that appellant's anxiety was caused by the agency's rejection of him on several occasions, not just the 1993 nonselection. Because discrimination has been found only with regard to the 1993 nonselection, appellant is entitled only to damages stemming from that nonselection. Finally, we considered the amounts awarded in similar cases. Accordingly, we find that $5,000.00 is a proper award for that portion of appellant's emotional distress caused by the 1993 nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Partridge v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966161 (1998), the Commission awarded $1,000 in nonpecuniary damages, noting that the complainant's evidence focused "overwhelmingly" on the effects of his ongoing contentious relationship with his supervisor, but the finding of discrimination was based on a denial of request for a schedule change. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01956059 (1998) (an award based on a judgment that 65% of the complainant's injuries resulted from factors other than discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Kannikal v. Attorney General</span>, 04A00017 (2001), where the Commission awarded $32,500 in damages. In part, the Commission discounted the complainant's claim for $200,000 in damages because at least some of his emotional distress was not caused by the agency's discriminatory refusal to rehire him, but came after the agency reinstated him and was the result of a subsequent dispute with his supervisor over a low performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">That there are stressors other than discrimination in a complainant's life--a fact which is undoubtedly true for any complainant--does not necessarily mean that a damage award must be reduced. In <span class="Italic">Yeh v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01973721 (2000), the Commission overturned an agency decision to reduce by one-third the requested damages of the complainant where her psychiatrist attributed her condition to a combination of discrimination in the workplace, the onset of menopause, and the death of the complainant's mother. The Commission noted that the psychiatrist did not assign degrees of causation for each of these elements and other evidence indicated it was the discrimination that precipitated the complainant's symptoms. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Yeh</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1946"></span>After a careful review of the evidence of record, the Commission finds that the record supports complainant's claim for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensatory damages. In this regard, we disagree with the agency's decision to award complainant only one-third of her proven past and future pecuniary damages. This decision was based on a single statement by complainant's psychiatrist that her depression was rooted in three causes: her work situation, her mother's death and the start of menopause. However, the Commission notes that this psychiatrist offered no opinion about these three causes being equally responsible for complainant's emotional condition. On the other hand, complainant presented statements from numerous other witnesses about the significant and severe impact complainant's work situation had on her emotional health. The Commission notes that the majority of women experience the onset of menopause and the death of an elderly parent without experiencing the severe symptoms of depression described in the affidavits submitted by complainant in support of her claim for compensatory damages. The Commission finds that the record supports complainant's position that her work situation so exacerbated these normal life stressors that she was "pushed over the edge." It is the agency's burden to prove the possibility of other causes for complainant's damages<span class="Italic">. Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995). The agency has not met this burden. Accordingly, the Commission holds the agency fully liable for complainant's injuries and orders an award for all proven past and future medical and related transportation expenses....</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Totten v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A21880 (2003). Although the agency demonstrated that the complainant's mother was suffering from lung disease during the time of the discrimination and he also had financial difficulties, the Commission found the symptoms for which the complainant was treated were not caused by these external factors. The Commission found it significant that neither of these factors were mentioned in the psychiatrist's treatment records for the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Mohar v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100019 (2011), the Commission upheld a damage award of $100,000 by the administrative judge finding that the judge had adequately accounted for agency actions found not to be discriminatory, pain from a knee injury and the death of the complainant's dog--all external factors that the agency had argued should reduce the damages award. The Commission also rejected an argument by the agency that stress caused by the complainant's financial problems was not the result of discrimination but her decision to hire an "expensive attorney." The Commission did reject an argument by the complainant that she was entitled to an additional $50,000 in damages for loss of reputation. The Commission found that the complainant had not proved loss of reputation and that the award adequately accounted for her belief that her reputation was damaged. The <span class="Italic">Mohar</span> case is also unique because the Commission accepted evidence that complainant's PTSD was the result of workplace harassment. As a general rule, PTSD is caused by a single event and not multiple workplace events so it is rare for such a diagnosis to be attributed to discrimination though in many cases the Commission has awarded damages for aggravation of a preexisting PTSD condition. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mohar</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review, we find that the record shows that Complainant suffered major depression, as well as PTSD. The expert psychologist provided testimony that the PTSD was triggered by fear of personal harm in the workplace, which the evidence shows was caused by the Agency's acts of retaliatory harassment, as specified in Complaint 3. The expert further noted that workplace situations typically do not trigger PTSD, which suggests that the harassment Complainant experienced caused a severe emotional reaction. Testimony at the damages hearing from this expert, as well as from Complainant's treating therapist, her friends, and Complainant herself, consistently confirmed that Complainant underwent a complete transformation from an outgoing happy person, to one riddled by anxiety, depression, and self-loathing. Complainant testified that she almost committed suicide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute the severity of the emotional distress. However, the Agency argues that much of it was not caused by discriminatory conduct. The Agency argues that most of the emotional distress was caused by a dire financial situation, which did not result from lost income due to the discriminatory conduct, but rather to Complainant's decision to hire an expensive attorney. The Agency also argues that the AJ did not assess witness testimony on the severity of Complainant's emotional distress; and that the AJ failed to recognize that the witnesses based their assessments on the cumulative emotional effect from both discriminatory and nondiscriminatory workplace, conduct, as well as on the above described non-workplace incidents. However, we find that the testimony of the expert witness, who diagnosed PTSD, and pinpointed its trigger to the Agency's discriminatory conduct, is probative in demonstrating that most of the emotional suffering was due to unlawful retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency additionally argues that the date of Complainant's dog, and the pain and incapacity associated with a knee injury, contributed significantly to Complainant's emotional distress. Again, we agree that record evidence supports this argument. Therefore, to the extent that it can be assessed, the emotional harm from these two factors is not compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues for a separate award of $50,000.00 for loss of reputation associated with the slanderous email. However, the Agency argues that Complainant showed no actual harm to her reputation, and that Complainant's argument is mere speculation. We agree that a separate award is not warranted. Nonetheless, Complainant showed that she suffered extreme emotion distress upon learning of the content of the email and to whom it was sent. She reasonably felt that she had been maligned, and that her reputation and career were ruined. Complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary compensatory damages for this emotional harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, Complainant argues that when comparing damage award in previous cases, to insure that the award in the instant matter is indeed comparable, the award must be adjusted upward, to factor for the value of the present dollar. However, we discern no clear legal precedent to allow for this upward adjustment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful review, we find that all of Complainant's emotional distress cannot be attributed to the Agency's discriminatory conduct. Nevertheless, the more severe aspects certainly can. On the other hand, work-related incidents found not to be discriminatory, or which occurred outside the time frame at issue, must be excluded from the award. In review the record, such incidents do not appear to have significantly contributed to the emotional distress. By contrast, non-work related factors, such as Complainant's debt, the death of her dog, and pain and incapacity from a knee injury played a significant role.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the record, especially the testimony provided at the damages hearing, we find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's balancing of the various factors discussed above to set the amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages at $100,000. In so finding, we note that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm, and not to punish the Agency for its discriminatory actions. Furthermore, we find that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Conrad v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120090690 (April 9, 2010); <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070051 (January 3, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the AJ's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages in the amount of $100,000,00.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge is not required to identify a specific percentage reduction of a damage award for external causes. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070031 (2009), the agency argued that a damage award of $30,000 should be reduced by 20% due to causes other than the agency's discrimination. The Commission rejected the argument noting that the administrative judge specifically stated in her decision that she had reduced the award for external causes, though the decision did not identify a specific amount of reduction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Turic v. Holland Hospitality, Inc.</span>, 85 F.3d 1211 (6th Cir. 1996), the court found the plaintiff's vulnerability was a relevant factor to consider in awarding damages. In that case, the trial judge awarded the plaintiff $50,000 in compensatory damages after finding that she was discharged for contemplating an abortion. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Turic</span>, 85 F.3d at 1215, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court, in the instant proceeding, found that as a young, unwed mother was walking an "economic tightrope" and who had just discovered she was pregnant for a second time, Turic was in a particularly vulnerable position and was highly dependent upon her job....Turic's vulnerability is particularly relevant because her supervisors had direct knowledge of her vulnerability before they discharged her....</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Turic</span> did note that using the factor of vulnerability means that "unusual sensitivity" may increase a damage award whereas "unusual hardiness" may reduce the award. But, in each instance, the court found this compensates the victims for the actual harm done and makes the defendant responsible for its acts. <span class="Italic">See also Palmer, supra</span> (distress suffered as a result of the discrimination was fully compensable, even though it was enhanced by complainant's "preexisting sensitivity").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953977 (1998), the Commission awarded $110,000 to the victim of hostile environment sexual harassment where the complainant had some previous treatment due to marital problems unrelated to the harassment. In <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Secretary of Defense, AAF</span>, 01956675 (1998), the Commission considered evidence of the complainant's wife's drinking problem and difficulties the complainant had with his stepdaughter in awarding $16,000 in nonpecuniary damages.</p>
