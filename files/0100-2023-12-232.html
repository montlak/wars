<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-218"><span class="space">L.</span> ABUSE OF PROCESS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Closely related to dismissal for failure to prosecute is dismissal of a complaint for abuse of process. Prior to the 1999 amendments to Part 1614, there was no regulatory basis for dismissing complaints on grounds of abuse of process. However, in a few extreme cases, the EEOC upheld such dismissals of complaints by agencies for abuse of process. The case law that evolved on abuse of process culminated in the amendment of Part 1614 to provide for abuse of process as a regulatory basis of dismissal at 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(9):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the agency, strictly applying the criteria set forth in Commission decisions, finds that the complaint is part of a clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process for a purpose other than the prevention and elimination of employment discrimination. A clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process requires:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Evidence of multiple complaint filings; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Allegations that are similar or identical, lack specificity or involve matters previously resolved; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;Evidence of circumventing other administrative processes, retaliating against the agency's in-house administrative processes or overburdening the EEO complaint system.</p>
<p class="noindent">Dismissal for abuse of process is proper only in cases where there has been a clear misuse or abuse of the process. MD-110, at 5-20 to 5-23 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.l07(a)(9) is the appropriate provision under which an agency may dismiss a complaint on the extraordinary grounds of abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Abuse of process is defined as a clear pattern of misuse of the process for ends other than that which it was designed to accomplish<span class="Italic">. See Buren v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05850299 (1985); <span class="Italic">Kleinman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943637 (1994); <span class="Italic">Sessoms v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973440 (1998). The Commission has a strong policy in favor of preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible. The occasions in which application of the standards are appropriate must be rare, because of the strong policy in favor of preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible<span class="Italic">. See generally Love v. Pullman</span>, 404 U.S. 522 (1972); <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932105 (1993). Therefore, such dismissals must be taken only in cases where there is a clear misuse or abuse of the administrative process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;In order to determine whether a complaint, or a number of consolidated complaints, should be dismissed for this reason under &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9), the agency or Administrative Judge must strictly apply the criteria established by the Commission on this issue. This requires an analysis of whether the complainant evidences an ulterior purpose to abuse or misuse the EEO process. Agencies are cautioned that numerous complaint filings alone is not a sufficient basis for determining that there has been an abuse of the process. However, multiple filings on the same issues, lack of specificity in the allegations, and the filing of complaints on allegations previously raised, may be considered in deciding whether a complainant has engaged in a pattern of abuse of the EEO process. All pending complaints from a complainant which satisfy these criteria should be consolidated for dismissal under this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Cases in which the Commission has found an abuse of the EEO process include those where, upon review of the complainant's record, including the number and types of complaints filed, the Commission has concluded that the complainant has pursued a scheme involving the misuse and misapplication of the EEO process for an end other than that which it was designed to accomplish.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;For example, in reviewing a complainant's prior complaints, the Commission has found abuse of process where the complainant presented similar or identical allegations, evidencing a pattern of initiating the complaint process whenever the agency did anything that dissatisfied the complainant<span class="Italic">. Hooks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953852 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The Commission has also found abuse of process when the complainant presented similar or identical allegations related to the complainant's dissatisfaction with the EEO process itself<span class="Italic">. Goatcher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950557 (1996). The complainant in Goatcher filed numerous complaints concerning the agency's purported denial of access to sufficient equipment and storage for EEO claims, denial of official time for such claims, inadequate EEO counseling, agency monitoring of time spent in the EEO process, and failure to maintain her anonymity during EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Sessoms v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973440 (1998), the Commission noted that the appellant was experienced in the EEO process, but that he pursued a clear pattern of abuse of the EEO process by filing numerous frivolous complaints. The Commission noted, "A definite pattern of initiating the complaint machinery with respect to any matter with which appellant was dissatisfied has developed,...clearly has amounted to an abuse of process." <span class="Italic">See also Kessinger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0197639 (June 8, 1999) (clear pattern of abuse from multiple filings, totaling over 160 complaints and 150 appeals, many of which were duplicate complaints of earlier, dismissed filings; Commission found the complainant's actions an intentional effort to clog the agency's in-house administrative machinery); <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Dep't. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120113142, 0120113817, and 0120114019 (Dec. 6, 2011) (clear pattern of abuse from multiple filings many of which concerned selections for positions for which complainant was not eligible to apply).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;The Commission has stressed in such cases that a party cannot be permitted to utilize the EEO process to circumvent other administrative processes; nor can individuals be permitted to overburden the EEO system, which is designed to protect individuals from discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The complainant originally filed a complaint of discrimination in non-selection for promotion. Subsequently, he repeatedly filed complaints of reprisal, alleging that the agency was denying him official time to prepare EEO complaints, denying him the use of facilities and storage space for his EEO materials, providing improper EEO counseling, and unfairly keeping tabs on the amount of official time he was spending on his EEO complaints. Many of the allegations in these complaints were vague, and raised allegations previously raised in earlier complaints. In fact, he had on several occasions copied a previous complaint on which he would write a new date in order to file new complaint. Over the course of several months, he filed a total of 25 complaints in this manner. The agency could consolidate the subsequent complaints and dismiss them under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a) for abuse of process. The complainant had demonstrated a pattern of abuse of the process, involving multiple complaints containing identical or similar allegations. (See, for example, <span class="Italic">Kessinger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976399 (June 8, 1999); <span class="Italic">Story v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970083 (May 22, 1998).)</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The complainant originally filed a complaint of discrimination in non-selection for promotion. Subsequently she filed a total of 15 <span id="Page_274"></span>complaints, many alleging specific and distinct acts of reprisal for her prior EEO activity. Based on the number of complaints alone, the agency attempted to dismiss them all for abuse of process. There was insufficient evidence to dismiss the complaints for abuse of process. Evidence of numerous complaint filings, in and of itself, is not a sufficient basis for determining that there has been an abuse of the process. In this case, there was no evidence that the complainant's ulterior purpose was to abuse the EEO process, or that she was misusing the process for ends other than that which it was designed to accomplish. It may be appropriate, however, for the agency to consolidate the individual complaints for processing. (See, for example, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dep't. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01975901 (May 29, 1998); and <span class="Italic">Donnelly v. Dep't. of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972171 (Nov. 17, 1997) for decisions rejecting agency contentions of abuse of process.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Allegations of discrimination do not always have precise parameters at the outset. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Jeffery J. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020004860 (2020), "a complainant often will not know precisely what the basis of possibly discriminatory conduct is and may take a best guess and list multiple bases." That is not abuse of process. Nor is the fact that an employee filed numerous complaints is not a sufficient basis by itself for dismissing subsequent complaints by that employee. In that case, the complainant filed 9 complaints and many more with other agencies. The agency dismissed the last complaint for abuse of process. The Commission reversed, noting that the analysis for abuse of process is on the totality of the complainant's "claims, circumstances, and intentions" in <span class="Italic">Jeffery J</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency has not provided support for its abuse of process dismissal. We readily acknowledge that Complainant has filed multiple complaints regarding non-selection. However, this action alone does not rise to the level of abuse of process. Nine complaints filed, along with multiple bases, are not dispositive of an abuse of process. A complainant often will not know precisely what the basis of possibly discriminatory conduct it and may take a best guess and list multiple bases. The Agency noted that in one of his complaints that was filed in May 2020, Complainant pleaded for a temporary job so he could have eye surgery at the Agency's facility. As previously stated, the number of complaints filed by Complainant is not sufficient to demonstrate an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, and perhaps most significantly, there is no evidence to support a finding that the instant complaint is an attempt to circumvent or overburden the process for the reasons proffered by the Agency. Indeed, the Agency offers various grounds in support of this proposition: that Complainant's complaint filings have been identical or "similar"; that numerous complaints filed have never resulted in a discrimination finding; that Complainant is using the complaint process as a "weapon" to secure an Agency position; and that Complainant has disparaged an Agency official, which is reflective of merely a "personal grudge." We determine, however, that none of these assertions undercut Complainant's complaint regarding the subject claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted in <span class="Italic">Kerrigan v. USPS</span>, 01830355 (1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the agency's rejection of appellant's complaint because of "abuse of process," the regulations for processing EEO complaints do not provide that such alleged abuse is a valid basis for rejection. The Commission is not unmindful that some complainants may abuse the EEO process for various reasons. However, following the EEO regulations created for processing complaints is the best way to weed out non-meritorious claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly found that the agency erred in dismissing the twelve complaints filed in <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 01995528 (2001). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pleasant</span> warned against dismissing merely because of numerosity and noted that the complaints filed raised legitimate issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency noted in its decision that over an eleven-year period, complainant filed twenty-nine complaints and the agency issued sixteen decisions. The agency also noted that each complaint cites between six and thirty-two different responsible officials. Numerosity alone, however, is insufficient for a finding of abuse of process. Moreover, we do not find the amount of case filed by complainant to be extraordinary<span class="Italic">. See Kessinger v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0197639 (June 8, 1999) (over 160 complaints and 150 appeals); <span class="Italic">see also Donnelly v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972171 (Commission reversed dismissal of sixteen complaints for abuse of process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While acknowledging that the total number of complaints is not as great as other cases before the Commission, the agency stated that "the nature of her complaints shows abuse of process." The agency found that the complaints raised "frivolous issues citing similar or identical allegations." A review of the record reflects that most of the claims raise substantive issues pertaining to the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment. For example, complainant claimed discrimination relating to attendance, discipline, reasonable accommodation, and performance evaluations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kenyatta S. v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 2019003653 (2019), the administrative judge dismissed the complaint for abuse of process noting that complainant had an "overwhelming" record of litigation and determined that the complainant "used the EEO complaint process as a 'weapon' to retaliate against her supervisor and other managers." In reversing the dismissal, in <span class="Italic">Kenyatta S</span>., the Commission considered the number of complaints, the content of those complaints and the complainant's seemingly genuine belief that she was a victim of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record includes a history of Complainant's cases indicating that Complainant filed a total of 20 EEO complaints from 2004 through 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">MD-110 cautions that "numerous complaint filings alone is not a sufficient basis for determining that there has been as abuse of the process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We do not find, as the AJ acknowledged in her decision, that the number of EEO complaints filed by Complainant over a twelve-year period to be extraordinary. <span class="Italic">Compare, Kessinger v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0197639 (June 8, 1999) (over 160 complaints and 150 appeals); <span class="Italic">Hooks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953852 (November 28, 1995) (132 open appeals).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also address the AJ's argument that Complainant provided "bare bone facts" during the investigation of her complaints to suggest that Complainant's allegations were so lacking in supporting evidence that they could not have been raised in good faith. However, we conclude that this analysis pertains only to whether Complainant has proven her allegations of discrimination and does not address whether Complainant's filing of her two complaints amounted to an abuse of process. In that vein, we similarly determine that the AJ's assessment that Complainant's affidavits were "often short, vague, and repeat[ed] phrases that she has used in other complaints" was not adequately reflective of her pursuing the EEO complaint process in bad faith. If Complainant's affidavit responses were unartfully phrased or lacking in detail, we do not find under the circumstances presented in this case that this adequately evidenced an abuse of process. Here, Complainant, without legal representation, has raised substantive claims on a variety of matters ranging from harassment to transfer denials, which the Agency felt were sufficiently articulated to proceed with and successfully complete an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that while Complainant raised, among her other claims, an issue concerning not being provided adequate official time to litigate her EEO claims, this too was insufficient to consider an abuse of process. <span class="Italic">Compare, Goatcher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950557 (October 18, 1996) (Complainant filed 22 appeals in a one-year period alleging dissatisfaction with complaint processing, including the agency's purported denial of access to sufficient equipment and storage for EEO claims, denial of official time for such claims, inadequate EEO counseling, agency monitoring of time spent in the EEO process, and failure to maintain her anonymity during EEO counseling).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the AJ cited to deposition testimony of Complainant where she stated she wanted to ruin the careers of the management officials she believed were ruining her career through their discriminatory actions. From this testimony, the AJ concluded that its was Complainant's goal to "use the EEO process, as a weapon, to put supervisors and managers at risk for a poor evaluation or discipline when a complaint is filed." Again, Complainant's comment, while intemperate, is insufficient to overcome the Commission's strong policy on preserving a complainant's EEO rights. A fair reading of the complete record in these two complaints reflects that Complainant seems to genuinely believe that she is a victim of discrimination and that she will eventually remedy her situation through the EEO complaint process. It appears that Complainant's comments, at worst, reflect the frustration of a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> complainant who feels that she has been discriminatorily treated as indicated in her subject claims, and is not dissimilar to the assertions of many other EEO complainants, who have vented displeasure at perceived discrimination by management officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, based on our review of all the circumstances presented in this case, we do not find adequate justification to overcome the Commission's strong policy against depriving Complainant of her right to proceed with her two EEO complaints and receive a decision on the merits of her claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, however, upheld dismissal for abuse of process where the AJ found that the complainant "'weaponized the EEO process' as a means of 'retaliating' against the Agency and with the hope overburdening its EEO office" in <span class="Italic">Lyle P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2019005269 (2020):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the AJ recounted that he spent significant hours untangling Complainant's EEO history and uncovered that his complaints raise four non-selections he alleged in prior EEO complaints that were previously before an EEOC hearings unit--with the only difference being that he changed the year he allegedly learned of them from 2015 to 2016. In the prior case, in September 2015, an AJ issued a default judgment against the Agency for failure to timely produce the EEO investigation. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in December 2015, <span id="Page_275"></span>resolving the Agency's obligations under the default judgment order. This included temporarily selecting and promoting Complainant on paper to a GS-14, step 1 position for nearly four years and thereafter permanently promoting him from his GS-12 position to a GS-13 position in Houston, Texas (which started in January 2016), and back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ recounted four different non-selections in the consolidated complaints that Complainant alleged he was notified or learned of between April 2016-June 2016, but application closing dates for two were in December 2014 and February 2015, and the non-selections for the others occurred in March and May 2015. The AJ suspected it was unlikely the Agency would have waited as long as Complainant alleged to notify him of these non-selections and it was likely, given his prior practice, that he would have filed EEO complaints regarding them. The AJ recounted that because of this suspicion, he reviewed 4,437 pages of documents in the consolidated complaints record and numerous records in some other cases involving hundreds of more pages, and this revealed Complainant's attempt to adjudicate the four non-selections that he already settled. The AJ indicated he did not have the time and resources to review more claims filed by Complainant in other cases to determine if more non-selections in the consolidated complaints were also already adjudicated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that Complainant's claim of systematic discrimination on a variety of protected bases was widely speculative in nature. For example, Complainant contended that the Agency only promotes Catholics because its headquarters human resource office is made up mostly of them, without any evidence they were Catholic or how they knew his religion. The AJ found that after Complainant lost his security clearance in January 2016, he filed many EEO complaints regarding non-selections for which he was unqualified because he lacked the requisite clearance. He also filed EEO complaints on non-selections for positions that were all over the country and overseas, many of which would not have resulted in a promotion. Complainant did this after settling a case where he specifically negotiated a transfer to Houston, which suggests that he filed multiple non-selection complaints without any intent to take the position if he were selected. He continued to reside in Houston after retiring. The AJ further found Complainant's claims lacked specificity in that he often did not know the identity of either the selecting officials or the selectees. The AJ noted that much of the language in his complaints was the same, with Complainant simply changing the vacancy announcement number. He noted Complainant made vague accusations of systemic discrimination on such a wide variety of protected basses that it strains credulity that he believed that in each case he was non-selected on the basis of discrimination or retaliation. After Complainant lost his security clearance, the AJ found the pace of his EEO complaints increased considerably, suggesting with the other circumstances discussed, that he had "weaponized the EEO process" as a means of "retaliating" against the Agency and with the hope overburdening its EEO office to achieve another default judgment sanction. Based on all these factors, the AJ dismissed the ten consolidated complaints before him for abuse of process pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he AJ determined Complainant abused the EEO process in two main two ways--by deliberately relitigating claims already litigated and closed with substantial relief, and by overwhelming the Agency's in-house EEO machinery to force another default judgment against the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our independent review of the record, we find that the AJ properly dismissed Complainant's ten consolidated complaints before him for abuse of process, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9), for the same reasons recounted above by the AJ. In doing so, we find significant similarities between this situation and other cases where we have found abuse of process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Abell v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33023 (May 13, 2004) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 40 complaints of non-selection with no intention to take the job); <span class="Italic">A. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01A60843, 01A61391, 01A61781, 01A62205, 01A62852 (Aug. 31, 2006) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 25 complaints over non-selections where complainant was ineligible for positions for which he applied); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120110604, 0120111454, 0120111991 (Apr. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120113142, 0120113817, 0120114019 Dec. 6, 2011); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100479 (Dec. 30, 2011) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed seven complaints over numerous non-selections where complainant was ineligible for the positions for which he applied). It should be noted that, in all these cited cases, only the specific complaints at issue were dismissed, not other/future complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">An interesting side note to the <span class="Italic">Lyle P.</span> case is that, in addition to dismissing the complaints before him, the AJ also ordered that any pending "claims" in the EEO process be dismissed and barred the complainant from filing any EEO complaints against any federal agency in the future. The agency implemented the dismissal of the at-issue complaints and dismissed all other pending complaints against the agency, but declined to bar the complainant from future EEO complaints. "It reasoned that the bar was unprecedented and contrary to the Commission's policy of preserving a complainant's rights in the EEO process when possible." The complainant appealed and before the Commission this time, the agency asked that the AJ's order bar future complaints be upheld. The Commission agreed with the agency's original position that barring future complaints was outside of the AJ's authority in <span class="Italic">Lyle P</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he AJ also dismissed all Complainant's EEO "claims" pending with the Agency not before the AJ in this case and enjoined him from filing future EEO complaints with any federal agency. We find these orders go beyond the AJ's authority under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9) and &#x00A7; 1614.109(b).5 The Agency is free to procedurally dismiss cases pending before it at the pre-hearing stage for any of the reasons enumerated in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a) with appropriate appeal rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will consider not only the number of complaints, but the time period during which they were filed and the outcome of the cases. As it explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132532 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a policy, the Commission aims at preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible and we rarely permit dismissal of a complaint for abuse of process. <span class="Italic">See Kessinger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976399 (June 8, 1999); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110), Ch. 5, &#x00A7; IV.A.4 (Nov. 19, 1999). Given this policy and our concern about protecting complainants and their rights under the EEO statutes, the agency bears a very high standard of proof ultimately to show that complainant's actions reveal "an ulterior purpose to abuse or misuse the EEO process." MD-110 at Ch. 5, &#x00A7; IV.A.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Filing numerous complaints alone is not a sufficient basis for dismissal. The Agency must show evidence that somehow in filing numerous complaints a complainant specifically intended to misuse the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Compare Wiatr v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30752 (Feb. 25, 2004) (finding no abuse of process in the case of a complainant who filed over 40 complaints, but where the record did not show that he did so for any other reason than to put an end to alleged discrimination); <span class="Italic">with Abell v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33023 (May 13, 2004) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 40 complaints of non-selection with no intention to take the job). Therefore, the focus of the analysis is on the totality of the individual's claims, circumstances, and intentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that Complainant filed her 14 EEO complaints from 1995 through 2012. Therefore, although Complainant has filed multiple EEO complaints, she has done so over a 17-year period. We also find that the Agency has not shown that these complaints were frivolous, particularly since the Commission has found in Complainant's favor in the past. Further, we are not persuaded by the AJ's finding that Complainant has also filed grievances on the same matters. As correctly stated by Complainant, employees of the Postal Service are to file both a union grievance and an EEO complaint on the same matter. As such, Complainant was merely exercising her legal rights by filing both a grievance and the instant EEO complaint. Finally, the Agency has failed to provide any evidence that her complaints were to retaliate against the Agency's in-house administrative processes or to overburden the EEO complaint system. Accordingly, we determine that the AJ erred in dismissing the instant complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9) for abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Rytelewski and Ridley v. USPS</span>, 05830170, 05830171 (1984), the Commission upheld the agency's decision to dismiss a series of individual complaints filed over the same action where the Commission found "extraordinary evidence of bad faith" on the part of the union representative in encouraging the complaints. <span class="Italic">Rytelewski</span> has been limited to the unique facts of that case and agencies have been cautioned about relying upon it as precedent in dismissing complaints. <span class="Italic">See McCray v. USPS</span>, 01852716 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing whether a complainant, through filing numerous complaints, is attempting to abuse the process, the Commission will look at the nature of the complaints. When the volume of complaints spawns 120 appeals, 142 requests to reopen and all entail multiple filings containing frivolous allegations, the Commission has the authority to dismiss all of the complaints. In the case of <span class="Italic">In re Buren</span>, 05850299 (1985), the Commission exercised that authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the ultimate opinion of this Commission, that the appellant has pursued a scheme involving the misuse or misapplication of the administrative process which he "justified in itself for an end other than that which it was designed to accomplish." The appellant in the enumerated cases merely presented frivolous and numerous equal employment opportunity complaints, which cited similar or in some cases identical allegations. A definite pattern of initiating the complaint machinery for any matter of which appellant was dissatisfied had developed, which clearly amounted to an abuse of the administrative process....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_276"></span>The Commission refused to apply <span class="Italic">Buren</span> in a case where the complainant had filed 17 related complaints noting that the activity did not approach that in <span class="Italic">Buren</span>. <span class="Italic">See Bucci v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01892453 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has indicated that in considering whether to impose a ban against future complaints, the number of complaints is important, but a far more important factor is the substance of those complaints. In <span class="Italic">Kleinman v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940579 (1994), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a final matter, the Commission cautions appellant that it retains the right to protect its processes and procedures from misuse and abuse. Although Commission regulations do not explicitly provide for sanctioning individuals who abuse the EEO process, <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900221 (June 15, 1990), the language of the regulations does not deprive the Commission of its authority to protect its administrative process. Quite to the contrary, the Commission has the inherent power, right, and obligation to control and prevent such abuse<span class="Italic">. Buren v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05850299 (November 18, 1985). On rare occasions, the Commission has applied abuse of process standards to particular complaints<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Wrenn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900010 (March 27, 1990); <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900221 (June 15, 1990). Occasions in which application of the standards are appropriate must be exceptional, because of the strong policy in favor of preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible<span class="Italic">. See generally Love v. Pullman, Inc.</span>, 404 U.S. 522 (1972). Abuse of process can be defined as a clear pattern of misuse of the process for ends other than that which it was designed to accomplish.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The process in this instance is designed to protect individuals from discrimination in employment. As noted at the outset, appellant has filed six requests for reconsideration of procedural decisions and sixteen separate appeals of final agency decisions dismissing complaints for procedural reasons during the present fiscal year. Moreover, since June 1991, appellant has filed forty-seven appeals of final agency decisions and seventeen requests for reconsideration. While appellant has filed far fewer filings with the Commission than the appellant in <span class="Italic">Buren</span>, the Commission noted in that case that the number of cases was not dispositive of whether an individual is abusing the process. More significant are the issues raised at the agency level and before the Commission. In this regard, the Commission notes that appellant's allegations concerning the slow or unsatisfactory response of a postal inspector to a letter concerning a matter unrelated to employment and addressed in other complaints; second and third generation improper processing allegations; multiple allegations concerning the same basic issues (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, release of MD-110 and EEO counseling and investigations conducted by mail); and collateral challenges to agency investigations are so far removed from the purpose of federal employment law as to suggest a possible abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At present the Commission will not find that appellant is abusing the process. It notes, however, that appellant has not worked for the agency for almost three years. Over that period, the ability of appellant to assert allegations of discrimination relating directly to his employment will and has diminished. Accordingly, the Commission will examine carefully allegations of discrimination that appellant presents on appeal or in requests for reconsideration in order to determine whether they relate to employment or concern matters sufficiently removed from the work place as to be indicative of abuse. If the latter, the Commission will not hesitate to impose the sanction identified in <span class="Italic">Buren</span> as appropriate in such circumstances, that is, the summary dismissal of appeals and requests for reconsideration filed by appellant with the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05028 (2001) (multiple complaints against the same agency official seeking the same relief).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reversed an agency dismissal for abuse of process in <span class="Italic">Monachino v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 0120073693 (2008), where it found no evidence of intent to abuse the process. In part, the agency relied on a comment by the complainant to the effect that he got angry and wanted to "get even" for the harm he had experienced. In reversing the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Monachino</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On rare occasions, the Commission has applied abuse of process standards to particular complaints. The circumstances where such standards are applicable, must be rare, due to the strong policy in favor of preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible. EEO Management Directive 110 (MD-I10), 5-17 (November 9, 1999) (<span class="Italic">citing Love v. Pullman,</span> 404 U.S. 522 (1972); <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01932105 (Aug. 19, 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final decision, the agency stated that complainant has filed six formal complaints containing about one hundred claims. Numerosity alone, however, is insufficient for a finding of abuse of process. Moreover, we do not find the amount of cases filed by complainant to be extraordinary. <span class="Italic">See Kessinger v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0197639 (June 8, 1999) (over 160 complaints and 150 appeals); <span class="Italic">see also Donnelly v. Department of Energy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972171 (Commission reversed dismissal of sixteen complaints for abuse of process). We also note that although the agency asserts that complainant has inundated the agency with e-mails and recurring EEO Counselor contacts, we find that the record fails to otherwise reflect any intent to abuse the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although the agency cited a certain remark made by complainant as evidence of his intention to use the EEO process to retaliate against agency officials, we find that the record fails to otherwise reflect any intent to abuse the EEO process. Instead, the record reflects that complainant genuinely believes that he is the victim of discrimination and believes he will eventually remedy his situation through the EEO complaint process. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the captioned complaints on the grounds of abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Card v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960181 (1996), the Commission defined abuse of process as a clear pattern of misuse of the process for ends other than that which it was designed to accomplish. The Commission found that the complainant had pursued a scheme involving the misuse and misapplication of the administrative process. The Commission found in <span class="Italic">Card</span> that the misuse was evident from the subject matter of the cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example: twenty appeals address the agency's purported denial of appellant's access to supplies, equipment, and storage for the processing of her EEO complaints both in the instant complaints or in previously filed complaints; fifteen appeals address the agency's purported impropriety in conducting EEO counseling by mail in the instant complaints or in previously filed complaints; and numerous other appeals address a variety of purported improprieties in the processing of complaints filed by herself, as well as in those filed by EEO complainants whom she represented, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, denial of the opportunity to represent other EEO complainants, "witness tampering," and breach of privacy regarding improper review of affidavits by agency officials. While not inclusive, the above listing of appellant's complaints is instructive. We are, moreover, not unmindful that appellant is not a novice in regard to the EEO complaint process. The Commission takes notice, for example, that in an eight-month period (January 1995-September 1995) thirty-five decisions were issued on appellant's appeals from agency dismissals. In the complaints that were the subject of those appeals, appellant repeatedly raised the identical or similar matters that are before the Commission in the instant appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sessoms v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973440 (1998), the Commission, in dismissing over 150 allegations in 22 complaints, noted that its decision "is not to be construed as holding that the mere filing of numerous complaints constitutes an abuse of process." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sessoms</span> determined that, aside from the sheer number of complaints, the employee was engaged in "a concerted attempt...to retaliate against the agency's in-house administrative machinery." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that the complainant abused the administrative process in <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05970326 (1998). In <span class="Italic">Fischer</span>, the Commission was careful to note that such cases are rare, in large part due to concern for protecting complainants from any chilling effects of their rights under Title VII:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the ultimate opinion of this Commission that appellant has pursued a scheme, as evidenced below, involving the misuse and misapplication of the administrative process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the agency points out and appellant does not dispute that from August 26, 1991 through the present, the Commission has decided over 70 cases involving appellant, many of which have involved multiple allegations. The majority of the 21 allegations in the complaints herein, concern the amount of official time afforded to appellant for EEO complaint activity or otherwise involve the EEO counseling and investigation process. We observe, as has the agency, that all but four of the appellant's cases were decided after his removal from agency employment and that appellant lost his mixed case appeal of that removal before the MSPB. Appellant's appeal of that decision in federal district court was dismissed over four years ago.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has also cited certain remarks made by appellant during complaint processing which we agree evidence his intention to use the EEO process to retaliate against agency officials due to his unhappiness at his failure to obtain relief for his removal from agency employment through administrative processes. We further rely upon appellant's actions noted above in failing to cooperate with investigators, EEO Officials, and the EEOC AJ assigned to this case. Finally, we rely upon appellant's continuing overburdening of OFO resources through his repeated insistence upon filing 21 separate appeals and separate yet almost identical appeal briefs on related issues that clearly warranted consolidated processing by the agency and the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission cannot permit individuals to overburden this system, which is designed to protect innocent individuals from discriminatory practices. Thus, this Commission declines to entertain the enumerated matters any further. This decision is not to be construed as a holding that the mere filing of numerous complaints constitutes an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_277"></span>It should be noted that failure to further administratively process the underlying allegations does not deprive, nor diminish, appellant's right(s) to file a civil action.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission upheld the agency's dismissal of a two-allegation complaint because of the numerous complaints filed by the employee but did not order dismissal of the remaining complaints for abuse of process. Although the Commission found that the two allegations in the complaint were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim, the Commission went on to warn and admonish the complainant in <span class="Italic">Skrypka v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974300 (1999), that</p>
<p class="noindent-1">we decline to continue directing the agency to consolidate appellant's complaints of harassment. Clearly, appellant has several complaints of harassment pending at various stages in the EEO process. To continually allow appellant to add to existing complaints would preclude closure/resolution of any of appellant's EEO matters. In view of the fact that appellant has complaints of harassment being processed, we find that to add the existing complaint allegations to those already in existence would not provide for any additional relief for appellant, but rather it would serve only to overburden the administrative processing of appellant's existing EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Skrypka</span> case is confusing because it leaves the entire situation unresolved. The decision seems to suggest that even if the agency was engaged in a continuing pattern of harassment, the complainant could not pursue future acts of harassment. It seems unlikely that this was the Commission's intent. Under the 1999 regulation amendments, the situation in <span class="Italic">Skrypka</span> could be addressed through amendments to the original complaint, rather than new complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Webster v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A51302 (2005), the Commission overturned the dismissal of two complaints containing 61 allegations of discrimination finding that the agency had not shown a pattern of abuse of process. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Webster</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to meet this standard. The record does not establish that any of the complaints that complainant filed are part of a clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process for a purpose other than the prevention and elimination of employment discrimination. As stated above, complainant's prior EEO activity consists of filing two complaints containing over sixty-one claims and incidents of disparate treatment and hostile work environment, and two breach of settlement agreements-this is hardly evidence of multiple complaint filings. Moreover, the Commission issued decisions on both these breach of settlement agreement matters. In <span class="Italic">Webster v. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A22096 (2003), we dismissed the matter on procedural grounds because complainant had pursued the claim in District Court. In <span class="Italic">Webster v. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03355 (Apr. 8, 2002), complainant alleged that the agency deceived him into agreeing to settle without telling him the effect that it would have on his "WG1 Buyout" potential. We found no breach of settlement agreement. Looking at these prior matters and comparing them to the issues raised in this complaint, it is clear that those prior issues are nothing like those raised here. The agency has provided nothing more to sustain its dismissal and has failed to show that complainant's actions reveal an intent to misuse the EEO process. It appears that what the agency aims to stop is complainant's effort to amend his complaint with what the agency deems to be frivolous claims. However, we have stated before, "following the EEO regulations created for processing complaints is the best way to weed out non-meritorious claims." <span class="Italic">Kerrigan v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01830355 (Jan 11, 1983). Our review of the record reflects that many of the claims raise substantive issues pertaining to the terms, conditions, or privileges of complainant's employment. Thus we remand these claims back to the agency for further investigation. Furthermore, contrary to the agency's arguments, we find no evidence of an attempt by complainant to retaliate against the agency's in-house administrative machinery, yet, we remind complainant that the Commission will not permit a party to use the EEO process to circumvent administrative processes.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Park v. Postmaster General</span>, 05870463 (1988), the Commission determined that it has the inherent authority to dismiss an entire class of complaints for abuse of process even though, in doing so, it may dismiss some legitimate complaints. In <span class="Italic">Park</span>, the complainant was one of a large number of employees who filed EEO complaints alleging that overtime was being assigned in a discriminatory fashion. The Commission found that the union was in a dispute with the agency concerning the overtime provision of the collective bargaining unit and had advised all of its member employees to file complaints. The Commission held in <span class="Italic">Park</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the administrative body charged with the ultimate administrative processing of these cases, we reserve unto ourselves the ultimate determination of whether an agency may decline to administratively process a complaint which, on its face, clearly meets the regulatory criteria.... Our governing regulations do not deprive us of our inherent authority to protect the EEO process from abuse by <span class="Italic">either</span> party.... We conclude that, where the record shows that employees are engaging in a collective bargaining effort to overwhelm the EEO complaint processing system, presenting form charges and appeals with the support of only sparse information, administrative processing of such complaints would serve no legitimate statutory purpose, and we decline to order the agency to process them.... While we consider that in declining to process these cases it is conceivable that one or more of these appellants may have a legitimate complaint, we note that our declining to administratively process does not deprive appellants of their right to a trial <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> in federal district court....</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, the Commission specifically limited its findings to the exceptional circumstances presented by the case namely, "(1) the agency has presented evidence that the complaint is one of many complaints that employees filed because of dissatisfaction with the overtime provisions of the collective bargaining agreement; (2) the complaint alleges discrimination with respect to application of overtime provisions and appears similar in form to other such complaints, and contains only sparse information concerning the incident; and, (3) the appellant has provided no evidence that her complaint is an exception to these events." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A60843 (2006), the Commission upheld the agency's dismissal for abuse of process focusing not on the number of the complaints, but on the nature of the complaints as a reflection of the complainant's intent. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stoyanov</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a policy, the Commission aims at preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible; thus, we rarely dismiss a complaint on these grounds. <span class="Italic">See Kessinger v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01976399 (June 8, 1999); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110), Ch. 5, IV, A, 4 (rev. Nov. 19, 1999). Given this policy and our concern about protecting complainants from the chilling effects of their rights under the EEO statutes, the agency bears a very high standard of proof ultimately to show that complainant's actions reveal "an ulterior purpose to abuse or misuse the EEO process." MD-110. at Ch. 5, IV, A, 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Filing numerous complaints alone is not a sufficient basis for dismissal. The agency must show evidence that somehow in filing numerous complaints complainant intended to misuse the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Compare Wiatr v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30752 (Feb. 25, 2004) (finding no abuse of process in the case of a complainant who filed over 40 complaints, but where the record did not show that he did so for any other reason than to put an end to alleged discrimination) with <span class="Italic">Abell v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33023 (May 13, 2004) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 40 complaints of non-selection with no intention to take the job). Therefore, the focus of the analysis is on the totality of the individual's claims, circumstances, and intentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority of complainant's EEO complaints following his removal in November 2003 involve allegations of discriminatory non-selections such as the ones raised in the instant complaints. Although we do not doubt complainant still believes his removal was unjust and discriminatory, two independent, administrative tribunals--the MSPB and the EEOC--reviewed the removal decision and found no discrimination. These 2004 and 2005 decisions are final; there is no further right to appeal his removal before the Commission. Despite knowing the finality of these decisions, he continued to argue before us that his removal was wrongful and that based on his personal belief, he remains a current employee. Moreover, despite knowing he was not qualified for the positions he sought because they were open only to current employees, he applied anyway. He knew he could not be referred for an interview or selected due to his non-employee status, and he even went so far as to misrepresent himself as an employee on his job applications. Agency officials have warned him that they know of his false applications and would not consider him unless his employment status changes. Complainant, however, disregarded the warnings and filed EEO complaints each time he received notice of his non-selection. Based on these facts we conclude that his only objective in applying for these positions and consistently raising arguments that were decided by two administrative tribunals was to file a futile EEO claim against the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In essence, complainant aimed to use the EEO process to retaliate against the agency and its officials for his removal and perceived unjust treatment, but this is not the purpose for which the process is to be used. The EEO process serves to prevent and eliminate workplace discrimination; it is not to be used as a means to carry out a personal grudge. <span class="Italic">See Sessoms v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01973440 (June 11, 1998) (finding abuse of process where complainant developed a pattern of "initiating the complaint machinery with respect to any matter with which complainant was dissatisfied").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, complainant's actions are similar to those of the complainant in <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970326 (Dec. 11, 1998), where we also found abuse of process. There, Mr. Fisher filed twenty-one complaints. All but four were decided after his removal, which, like complainant here, had been upheld by the MSPB. Mr. Fisher was dissatisfied with his failure to obtain relief for his removal <span id="Page_278"></span>from agency employment through the administrative process, so he filed the EEO complaints alleging, for the most part, that the agency improperly handled his official time requests and complaint processing. We concluded that certain of his remarks made during the processing; his failure to cooperate with investigators, EEO officials and the AJ; and his insistence on filing separate appeals on related issues that should have been consolidated--all revealed an intention to misuse the EEO process to retaliate against agency officials. Like Mr. Fisher, complainant here refused to cooperate with agency officials in correcting the false information he supplied on his job applications and attempted to use the administrative process to strike back at the agency and possibly gain reinstatement. As in <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, we will neither permit complainant to utilize the EEO process to circumvent administrative processes in this manner nor allow him to overburden the system, which is designed to protect individuals from discriminatory practices. Therefore, we decline to entertain complainant's non-selection claims where current federal employment status is required unless he can show such status or that non-status individuals were considered and/or selected.</p>
<p class="noindent">Apparently not getting the message, the same complainant had a second set of complaints dismissed for abuse of process in <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120063694 (2007). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120072703 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120150232 (2015), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the complaints, involving incidents that occurred between 1985 and 1987, should be dismissed for abuse of process where the complainant did not initiate the EEO process until 2014. The Commission had already sustained dismissal of the complaints as untimely, but did caution the complainant that he "is nevertheless advised that continued pursuit of the appellate process which does not involving current issues, but rather relates to purported Agency actions from decades ago could result in a finding of abuse of process in the future."</p>
<p class="noindent">A federal district court judge's finding that some claims included in a civil action were meritless is not a sufficient basis for entering a finding of abuse of process. The agency must submit specific evidence to support its contention. Moreover, the Commission will look not only at the number of complaints, but the results obtained in those complaints. In <span class="Italic">Malladi v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01992324 (2000), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a final matter, we note that despite the agency's claim to the contrary, the record does not establish that the subject complaints are part of a clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process for a purpose other than the prevention and elimination of employment discrimination<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9). The regulations allow for a finding of abuse of process if there is (1) evidence of multiple complaint filings; and (2) allegations that are similar or identical, lack specificity or involve matters previously resolved; or (3) evidence of circumventing other administrative processes, retaliating against the agency's in-house administrative process or overburdening the EEO complaint system<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing that such a finding is appropriate in these cases, the agency notes that complainant has filed 14 other EEO complaints and that in a lawsuit in federal court, a federal judge found that some of these claims were "so lacking in merit that the court must conclude that she has, and is, pursing these out of vindictiveness...." However, a review of Commission records reveals that complainant has only filed two other appeals to this Commission and that, in both, the agency's decisions against complainant were reversed and remanded. Because the agency has provided no specific information about those cases of complainant that have not been before this Commission, we have no basis on which to judge them. Therefore, we decline to issue a finding of abuse of the EEO process based on the facts presented in this proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bostron v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A12208 (2003), the Commission found that the complainant had not engaged in abuse of process, but also cautioned the complainant that he was coming close. In <span class="Italic">Bostron</span>, the Commission noted not only the number of complaints the complainant had filed, but the volume of similar material the complainant had provided with each complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has filed a very large number of complaints, but the majority of his pending claims concern individual nonselections. Complainant applied for each of these jobs, was rated as qualified for the majority of these positions, but was not selected. This is not evidence of misuse of the EEO process<span class="Italic">. See Black v. Small Business Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A10586 (March 19, 2002) (misuse of the EEO process dismissal improper for complaints involving mostly distinct, individual nonselections). Additionally, several of the complaints dismissed by the agency concern claims the Commission already has reviewed and remanded for an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission finds insufficient evidence that complainant has misused the EEO process, it notes that complainant is very close to such a finding in several respects. Complainant's formal complaints, beyond simply identifying the issues and bases, are often voluminous, convoluted documents with over 150 pages. In these documents, complainant refers to the same statistical evidence and Affirmative Employment plans to prove a "pattern and practice" of discrimination for each nonselection, although the federal courts addressed this issue and evaluated the statistical evidence in <span class="Italic">Bostron, et al. v. Apfel</span>, 104 F. Supp.2d 548 (D. Md. 2000), affirmed in 2 Fed. Appx. 235 (4th Cir. January 18, 2001), <span class="Italic">cert den</span>., 122 S. Ct. 218 (October 1, 2001). Any future attempt by complainant to attempt to raise these issues as separate claims of discrimination should be construed as an attempt to overburden the EEO process. Such "evidence" is properly raised during the investigative stage and/or at the hearing stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also repeats two claims in virtually every complaint he files: (a) complainant is denied his representative of choice; and (b) complainant is unable to obtain fair and equitable EEO Counseling. Claim (a) should not be raised as a separate claim of discrimination, but should be raised with the agency's EEO office and, if still necessary, with an EEOC Administrative Judge during a hearing and with the Commission in a subsequent appeal. If complainant further raises the claim regarding being denied a representative as a separate claim in his complaint rather than through the alternative scenarios just described, then complainant's complaints might be appropriately dismissed for misuse of the EEO process. The Commission further notes that the agency has repeatedly dodged this issue. The Commission has remanded claim (a) in several appeals, finding the agency's reasoning insufficient, but the agency continues to dismiss it with the same rejected reasoning. The agency has failed to show how it would be a conflict of interest for complainant's representative of choice, a team leader, to represent complainant, who also is a team leader. They have failed to provide evidence that the representative's duties create a conflict for him to represent anyone in the process. The agency also has not presented evidence that complainant and his chosen representative are in the same chain-of-command, report to the same officials, or other indicia of a conflict. While we do not decide today whether complainant has been wrongfully denied his representative of choice, we do not find it improper, at this point in time, for complainant to continually raise that argument during the processing of his complaints. Any future attempts to turn that argument into a separate claim, however, will from now on constitute misuse of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent complainant alleges harm from the processing of past complaints, the agency could have disposed of these claims pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(8). Complainant, however, takes issue with the processing of his pending complaint. The agency's duties in this circumstance are outlined in the Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 5-25-5-26 (November 9, 1999). The Commission notes, however, that repeatedly raising this claim without providing any specific information regarding the perceived shortcomings of the EEO Counseling, beyond the meaningless fact that the agency's EEO Office is staffed largely by minorities, may also give rise to an inference of misuse of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that several agency employees challenge the same agency action through the EEO process and that the action partly involves implementation of the collective bargaining agreement does not amount to an abuse of the EEO process. In <span class="Italic">Black v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920465 (1992), the Commission reversed an earlier decision to dismiss 29 complaints involving the decentralization of a special delivery unit. The Commission found that each of the complainants was aggrieved by having the terms and conditions of their employment altered, and noted there was no evidence of collusion.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120150545 (2015), where 53 employees filed identical complaints over the agency award program. In reversing dismissal for abuse of process, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that the Agency has failed to present evidence to meet its burden of proving misuse of the EEO process. While 53 employees, including Complainant, each filed a complaint over the awards program, there is simply no evidence presented that these filings were motivated by anything other than a desire to prevent disparate treatment with regard to those awards. Moreover, there is no evidence other than the Agency's speculation that there was a collective effort among the 53 complainants in this case to overwhelm the EEO complaint processing system. <span class="Italic">See Chapa v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870406 (May 27 1988) (misuse of process dismissal limited to exceptional circumstances such as <span class="Italic">Chapa</span> where the evidence showed that nearly 1,000 EEO complaints were filed by employees who were instructed by their union, which was engaged at the time with the agency in a contract dispute, to flood the agency's EEO complaint process). Here, the fact that all 53 complainants, who worked in the same facility, were represented by the same union steward is not, by itself, evidence of misuse. In addition, there is no credible argument that these 53 complaints could, in fact, overwhelm the Agency, especially as it may be appropriate for the Agency to consolidate the individual complaints for joint processing pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.606.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency has also argued that Complainant did not offer further evidence of disparate treatment or reprisal, and points to the matrix it developed showing that the 53 complainants were of <span id="Page_279"></span>various races, national origins, ages, religions, both sexes, and both had participated in, or had not participated in, prior EEO activity. We find, however, this argument addresses the merits of the claims raised without a proper investigation as required by the regulations, and is not relevant to the procedural issue of whether or not Complainant has stated a viable claim under the anti-discrimination laws VII and the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 regulations. <span class="Italic">See Osborne v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960111 (July 19, 1996); <span class="Italic">Lee v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930220 (August 12, 1993); <span class="Italic">Ferrazzoli v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910642 (August 15. 1991). Here, Complainant has alleged an injury or harm to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03885 (2002), the Commission found that the administrative judge erred in dismissing 53 complaints for abuse of process where the complainant previously filed some 36 complaints of harassment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 01A13173 (2002) (complainant filed 63 complaints, 52 of which involved nonselections).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has cautioned complainants about filing numerous complaints over a related issue when filing a complaint alleging a continuing violation would be sufficient to preserve the complainant's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Maczko v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883058 (1988). In that case, the complainant filed repeated complaints over the agency's failure to accommodate her with an eight-hour shift. Although the Commission declined to dismiss the complaints as identical, it did caution the complainant "that overuse of the agency's EEO procedures can at some point amount to abusive conduct which may frustrate rather than promote her objectives in this matter." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Generally, complainants have to go far beyond any normal abuse of process to require such a result. The Commission prefers to have such cases decided on the existing record. But, as the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05920705 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn first to the finding in the previous decision regarding the appellant's reason for his failure to appear at the hearing. The Commission agrees with the agency that it should be set aside. The previous decision drew the inference that appellant did not appear because of his medical appointment. The inference in itself is not necessarily erroneous, but it was error to use it as support for the finding that appellant did not fail to prosecute his complaint. Whether or not he in fact had a medical appointment on the day of the hearing is of no moment; the proper inquiry is whether or not the AJ properly denied appellant's request for a postponement when appellant asserted that he had a medical appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An EEOC Administrative Judge is to grant requests for postponement sparingly and for good reason. The Commission finds that the AJ acted properly in denying appellant's request, since appellant did not show good reasons for rescheduling. In view of the fact that the date of the hearing had been set for almost two months, appellant had to show more than the mere fact that he had subsequently scheduled a medical appointment on the same day. Clearly, since appellant made the postponement request one week before the hearing, the appointment was not a medical emergency warranting a postponement. We note also that appellant's statement on appeal is inconsistent with his letter to the AJ requesting a postponement. On appeal, appellant stated that he was experiencing difficulties in walking, sitting and standing, and "still is." He did not mention these difficulties in his letter to the AJ, and the permanence implied in the statement is inconsistent with the letter's request for a postponement to a date convenient to the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concludes that appellant's failure to appear warranted the AJ's remand of the complaint to the agency. By his action, appellant has forfeited his right to a hearing on his complaint. <span class="Italic">Curtis L. Wrenn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900010 (March 27, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An appellant's failure to appear at a hearing, without more, is not a sufficient showing to warrant cancellation of his or her complaint on the grounds of failure to prosecute. That is because of the Commission's general rule that an agency may not cancel a complaint when it has sufficient information on which to base an adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ross v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900193 (April 12, 1990). We note that sufficient information is likely to be available in a case processed pursuant to 29 CFR Part 1613 once the hearing stage has been reached, since the complaint has been investigated and a proposed disposition has been issued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency in its FAD stated its awareness of the Commission's general rule. However, relying on the appellant's stated repeated failures to appear and his "little regard for the various stages of the administrative process," the agency opted to cancel the complaint instead. In view of the agency's extensive discussion of appellant's past history and prior behavior in the FAD, it is clear that while stating reliance on the failure to prosecute portion of the EEOC Regulations, the agency was in fact basing its cancellation of the complaint on abuse of process grounds. We surmise that the agency invoked 29 CFR 1613.215(a)(6) because there is no provision in the Regulations permitting an agency to cancel a complaint on the grounds of abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the FAD raised the issue of whether the agency could appropriately cancel appellant's complaint on abuse of process grounds. We agree with the agency that appellant's prior conduct and past history are relevant considerations in that context. Since the previous decision evaluated the cancellation only under failure to prosecute standards, as set out in <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and failed to evaluate the agency's abuse of process rationale, the Commission has decided to reconsider its previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission Regulations do not explicitly provide for sanctioning individuals who abuse the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Richard Becker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900221 (June 15, 1990). However, the language of the Regulations does not deprive the Commission of its authority to protect its administrative process; quite the contrary, the Commission has the inherent power to control and prevent such abuse. <span class="Italic">Charles Buren v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05850299 (November 18, 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On rare occasions, the Commission has applied abuse of process standards to particular complaints. Occasions in which application of the standards are appropriate must be rare, because of the strong policy in favor of preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible. <span class="Italic">See generally Love v. Pullman, Inc.</span>, 404 U.S. 522 (1972). Abuse of process can be defined as a clear pattern of misuse of the process for ends other than that which it was designed to accomplish. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Buren</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The elements of abuse of process include, in addition to the ulterior purpose to misuse the process, a willful act that is not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">W. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts 898</span>, Lawyer's Ed. (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Buren</span>, the Commission concluded that the appellant had abused the administrative process. The appellant had filed numerous complaints, many of which were duplicative or were beyond the purview of the EEO process. In finding a definite pattern of abuse, the Commission relied on the nature of the subject matter of appellant's complaints, and on the volume, noting particularly the 142 appeals and requests to reopen that were pending at the time of the Commission's decision. The Commission found that the appellant had blatantly overburdened the administrative system, and declined to further entertain the pending complaints. In <span class="Italic">Becker</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the agency had rejected a complaint comprised of general, non-specific assertions. The Commission, while upholding the agency's rejection of the complaint on that basis, warned the appellant that abuse of process would not be tolerated. The Commission described the appellant's extensive history of filing complaints against federal agencies and private companies, and chronicled the numerous rulings of Circuit Courts which had enjoined the appellant from filing unsubstantiated civil actions. Appellant was put on notice that future appeals to the Commission would be summarily dismissed if the appealed complaints did not meet enumerated standards of specificity. In both <span class="Italic">Buren</span> and <span class="Italic">Becker</span>, the Commission emphasized that the mere filing of numerous complaints would not constitute an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These cases show that prior behavior is relevant when the issue is abuse of process, but also make clear that the prior behavior must be more than merely a large number of complaints. Here, in addition to filing numerous complaints, appellant has repeatedly engaged in acts that serve no purpose other than to obstruct the orderly processing of his complaints. The FAD thoroughly documents its examples of appellant's past history, including his previous failures on three occasions to appear at duly scheduled hearings for which he received adequate notice, and at trial. On one of these occasions, the agency had specifically asked appellant if he wished to proceed to hearing, since he had failed to appear at trial a short time before. Appellant responded by requesting that the hearing be conducted as soon as possible, but he then failed to appear. In addition, the FAD recounts appellant's withdrawal of a hearing request one week before the scheduled hearing, and his refusal to participate in the EEO process on one occasion. In the latter situation, the Commission ruled that appellant had engaged in contumacious conduct; he had refused to talk with an EEO Counselor and had failed to clarify vague allegations when requested to do so by the agency. <span class="Italic">Curtis L. Wrenn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900917 (September 27, 1990). The FAD also quoted from a Second Circuit opinion in a civil action brought by appellant in which the Court in essence found that appellant had failed to fulfill his obligation of good faith participation in the administrative process. <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 918 F.2d 1073 (2nd Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 111 S. Ct. 1625 (1991). The Court noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We cannot determine how many actions Wrenn has brought in federal courts. However, since 1985, Wrenn has been the appellant in at least forty<span class="Italic"> pro se</span> appeals in the Second, Fourth, Sixth and District of Columbia Circuits. He has been repeatedly cautioned and <span id="Page_280"></span>occasionally sanctioned for pursuing frivolous claims and appeals. His, many civil rights actions led the Sixth Circuit to state:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Wrenn's litigiousness is alarming. He is creating a small, very specialized library of cases on civil rights litigation all by himself.... His multiplicitous filings waste judicial resources.... Wrenn's abuse of the civil rights laws to manufacture litigation is most distressing.... <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Gould</span>, 808 F.2d 493, 505 (6th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">918 F.2d at 1075 n.1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the prior conduct on which the agency relied in its FAD, the Commission concludes that appellant's behavior rises to the level that warrants a Commission finding of abuse of the administrative process. His failures to appear at hearings have occurred so frequently as to constitute a pattern, and in view of the fact that he had adequate notice each time, we infer that his failures were willful acts. To request hearings, which entail considerable effort, time, and resources on the part of the Commission and the agency, and then willfully disregard them, nullifies the important role of the hearing in the EEO process and blatantly overburdens the process. The Commission finds that appellant has misused the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's conduct also manifests a degree of disinterest that as applied to the instant case is tantamount to an abandonment of his claim. Given the unusual circumstances here, the Commission has decided not to require the agency to issue a decision on the merits of appellant's complaint. We do not hereby overturn our general rule under <span class="Italic">Ross</span> that an agency may not cancel a complaint when it has sufficient information on which to base an adjudication, and continue to favor the strong policy of preserving the appellant's EEO rights wherever possible. This case, however, is the rare exception which warrants application of abuse of process standards rather than the more usual failure to prosecute standards of <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Therefore, the requirement to issue a decision on the merits of appellant's complaint is hereby waived, and the agency's decision to cancel appellant's complaint is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kessinger v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976399 (1999), the Commission upheld a dismissal for abuse of process where the complainant filed 99 appeals over 110 complaints. Not only did the complaints all allege reprisal, primarily concerning the agency's processing of his complaints, but the complainant went so far as to develop a checklist appeal form for himself. In finding the complainant's actions exhibited an intent to "clog" the system, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kessinger</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While not inclusive, the above narrative of appellant's complaints and appeals evidences a clear intent to overburden the EEO system with duplicate and redundant complaints on matters which have been found not to state a claim and have been adjudicated as such. Further, the Commission notes that appellant's latest appeals now contain a check off form, developed by appellant, where he checks off the appropriate argument, depending on the issue in the dismissed complaint that he is appealing. Clearly, appellant is knowingly filing repetitive complaints and appeals with the intent to "clog" the EEO system. He has blatantly overburdened the administrative system by filing these complaints. What is presented is another concerted effort by appellant to retaliate against the agency's in-house administrative machinery. The Commission cannot permit a party to utilize the EEO process to circumvent administrative processes; nor can the Commission permit individuals to overburden this system, which is designed to protect innocent individuals from discriminatory practices. Thus, this Commission declines to entertain the enumerated matters any further because appellant is clearly abusing the process. Appellant is strongly cautioned as to continuing such practices. As matters now stand, his arguments carry little credibility and weight given his record before the Commission. Appellant's use of the EEO system has evidenced a pattern of abuse, and he is reminded that the agency may severely limit the amount of official EEO time, if any, for complaints which are filed merely to overburden the system and perpetuate a pattern of abuse.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted). In a subsequent decision, <span class="Italic">Kessinger v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986946 (2000), the Commission noted that the agency could severely limit or deny entirely requests for official time to continue processing the employee's abusive complaints. In general, the Commission requires egregious behavior on the part of the complainant to justify a dismissal for abuse of process.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission does find abuse of process on the part of a complainant, the agency may dismiss future similar complaints without further processing. <span class="Italic">Ebner-Cupples v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120073731 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant filed some 50 complainants over nonselections, including nonselections for positions for which he was not qualified, after being removed from the agency, the Commission upheld a dismissal for abuse of process in <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120110604 (2011), explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are satisfied that the Agency has established that the complaints now before us are part of a pattern of abuse perpetrated by Complainant to punish the Agency by burdening the EEO system despite knowing that the complaints he filed were meritless. Complainant has filed over 50 administrative EEO complaints with the Agency. The clearest indication that Complainant's objective in filing his numerous EEO complaints was to vex the Agency rather than vindicate his rights under the EEO laws, is his recent practice of applying for positions he knows he is unqualified for. Complainant's employment with the Agency was terminated effective March 31, 2010. On at least 17 occasions since then, he has applied for positions with the Agency, for which non-employees were ineligible. In each case of those 17 cases, when he was rejected as not qualified, as he inevitably was, he filed an EEO complaint which the Agency dismissed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, as an abuse of process. In each case, he appealed the dismissal to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The bulk of complainant's EEO complaints following his removal in March, 2010 involve allegations of discriminatory non-selections. Complainant continues to argue before us that his removal was wrongful and that based on his personal belief, he remains a current employee. Moreover, despite knowing he was not qualified for the positions he sought because they were open only to current employees, he applied anyway. He knew he could not be referred for an interview or selected due to his non-employee status, and he even went so far as to misrepresent himself as an employee on his job applications. Agency officials have warned him that they know of his false applications and would not consider him unless his employment status changes. Complainant, however, disregarded the warnings and filed EEO complaints each time he received notice of his non-selection. Based on these facts we conclude that his only objective in applying for these was to file futile EEO claims against the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In essence, complainant aimed to use the EEO process to retaliate against the agency and its officials for his removal and perceived unjust treatment, but this is not the purpose for which the process is to be used. The EEO process serves to prevent and eliminate workplace discrimination; it is not to be used as a means to carry out a personal grudge. <span class="Italic">See Sessoms v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01973440 (June 11, 1998) (finding abuse of process where complainant developed a pattern of "initiating the complaint machinery with respect to any matter with which complainant was dissatisfied").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, complainant's actions are similar to those of the complainant in <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970326 (Dec. 11, 1998), where we also found abuse of process. There, Mr. Fisher filed twenty-one complaints. Mr. Fisher was dissatisfied with his failure to obtain relief for his removal from agency employment through the administrative process, so he filed the EEO complaints alleging, for the most part, that the agency improperly handled his official time requests and complaint processing. We concluded that certain of his remarks made during the processing; his failure to cooperate with investigators, EEO officials and the AJ; and his insistence on filing separate appeals on related issues that should have been consolidated--all revealed an intention to misuse the EEO process to retaliate against agency officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like Mr. Fisher, complainant here refused to cooperate with agency officials in correcting the false information he supplied on his job applications and attempted to use the administrative process to strike back at the agency. As in <span class="Italic">Fisher,</span> we will neither permit complainant to utilize the EEO process to circumvent administrative processes in this manner nor allow him to overburden the system, which is designed to protect individuals from discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting the its own reluctance to dismiss for abuse of process, the Commission nonetheless upheld the agency's dismissal on those grounds in <span class="Italic">Ardain v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120302 (2012), where the complainant alleged a continuing violation in selections beginning in 2006 through 2011 for over 90 positions. In doing so, the Commission noted that the complainant had already challenged her removal before MSPB, petitioned for review of that decision with EEOC, and pursued a wrongful termination claim in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Director of California and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In upholding the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Ardian</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a policy, the Commission aims at preserving a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible; thus, we rarely permit dismissal of a complaint on these grounds. <span class="Italic">See Kessinger v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01976399 (June 8, 1999); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110), Ch. 5, &#x00A7; IV.A.4 (Nov. 19, 1999). Given this policy and our concern about protecting complainants and their rights under the EEO statutes, the agency bears a very high standard of proof ultimately to show that complainant's actions reveal "an ulterior purpose to abuse or misuse the EEO process." MD-110 at Ch. 5, &#x00A7; IV.A.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Filing numerous complaints alone is not a sufficient basis for dismissal. The agency must show evidence that somehow in filing numerous complaints a complainant intended to misuse the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Compare Wiatr v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30752 (Feb. 25, 2004) (finding no abuse of process in the case of a complainant who filed over 40 complaints, but where the record did not show that he did so for any other reason than to put an end to alleged discrimination) <span class="Italic">with <span id="Page_281"></span>Abell v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33023 (May 13, 2004) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 40 complaints of non-selection with no intention to take the job). <span class="Italic">See also A. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01A60843, 01A61391, 01A61781, 01A62205, 01A62852 (Aug. 31, 2006) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 25 complaints over non-selections where complainant was ineligible for positions for which he applied); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos, 0120110604, 0120111454, 0120111991 (Apr. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120113142, 0120113817, 0120114019 Dec. 6, 2011); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100479 (Dec. 30, 2011) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 7 complaints over numerous non-selections where complainant was ineligible for the positions for which he applied). Therefore, the focus of the analysis is on the totality of the individual's claims, circumstances, and intentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances present here, we find that Complainant's complaint should be dismissed for abuse of process. While Complainant has not reached the sheer numbers of complaints present in the cases of <span class="Italic">Kessinger</span> (over 100 filed), <span class="Italic">A. Stoyanov</span> (25 complaints of non-selections), or <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov</span> (over 50 EEO complaints, and more than 2 dozen claims of post-removal non-selections), Complainant consistently claims a continuing violation for all non-selections dating from 2002 through the filing of this complaint. She has claimed over 90 positions were discriminatorily denied to her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has also satisfied 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(9)(ii) in that her allegations are similar or identical, and involve matters previously resolved, not only by this Commission, but also by the MSPB, the U.S. District Court for Northern District of California, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, she continues to persist in raising the same claims with each non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission affirms dismissals based on abuse of process in rare circumstances. We have been consistent in finding abuse of process in those cases in which a complainant has been removed from employment, has litigated the removal, and been unsuccessful in obtaining reemployment with the agency involved. <span class="Italic">See Ebner-Cupples v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073731 (Oct. 15, 2009) (complainant's claims of entitlement to priority reinstatement have been repeatedly litigated and future claims would be subject to dismissal for abuse of process); <span class="Italic">Abell v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33023 (May 13, 2004) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 40 complaints of non-selection with no intention to take the job); <span class="Italic">A. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01A60843, 01A6139 01A61781, 01A62205, 01A62852 (Aug. 31, 2006) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 25 complaints over non-selections where complainant was ineligible for positions for which he applied.); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120110604, 0120111454, 0120111991 (Apr. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120113142, 0120113817, 0120114019 Dec. 6, 2011); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100479 (Dec. 30, 2011) (finding abuse of process where complainant filed 7 complaints over numerous non-selections where complainant was ineligible for the positions for which he applied).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the cases of <span class="Italic">A. Stoyanov v. Department of the Navy, supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Department of the Navy, supra</span>, each complainant had been removed from the agency and had his removal upheld by the MSPB. The Commission found abuse of process for those complaints of non-selections filed after the removals were upheld by the MSPB, and where the non-selections were for positions that specified only current Agency employees were eligible. We find that Complainant's claims of non-selection, in the face of several Commission and federal court findings that she has not been discriminated against, also show a similar willingness to utilize the EEO process to pursue her grievances against the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to Complainant's claims of a vast conspiracy at the Agency to deprive her of her rights and to deny her employment, we take note that Complainant has previously raised this claim in U.S. District Court. The District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed her action with prejudice, found that her claims should have been raised in her previous civil action, and found that Complainant had failed to demonstrate that the Agency had fraudulently concealed evidence from her. The decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision, and noted that the lower court had "considered the merits of that action, including her allegations of obstruction of justice by the [Agency]." <span class="Italic">Ardalan v. White</span>, 58 Fed. Appx. 350, 2003 WL 1194059 (C.A.9 (Cal.)). Therefore, we find Complainant's conspiracy claims to have been previously addressed.</p>
