<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-106"><span class="space">8.</span> Optional Religious Activities</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to accommodate an employee's desire to engage in optional religious activities. Just what an agency is required to accommodate in the way of practices that are not required by a religion is now a developing area of the law. The Commission has rejected previous case law holding that an agency need only accommodate the fundamental tenets and beliefs of religious practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Nesbitt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996248 (2000), the Commission held that the complainant was not entitled to accommodation to attend choir practice and teaching services related to his religion. The Commission found "such activities as religious study and choir practice occurs as a desire of the participant and must be distinguished from a church member's belief in the tenets of the religion." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Woodrow B. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120141211 (2016), the Commission rejected the complainant's claim of failure to accommodate his religious practices where the agency denied his request for Religious Compensatory Time to "reflect on [his] Christian values." Further expanding this notion of "optional religious activities," the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that Complainant failed to establish that he was denied a religious accommodation. The record reveals that Complainant requested two weeks of RCT so that he could take a vacation, reflect on his Christian beliefs, and possibly view a religious statue while on the vacation. We find that going on vacation to reflect on religious beliefs and view religious statues are optional, voluntary activities. These activities are not compelled by a person's belief in the tenets of a religion. <span class="Italic">See Jacques v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083263 (July 17, 2012) (agency not required to accommodate complainant's request to rest on Mondays, the day after her religious obligations); <span class="Italic">Cole v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120064379 (Feb. 4, 2008) (driving the church bus and parking cars are optional, voluntary <span id="Page_1061"></span>activities not compelled by a person's belief in the tenets of a religion); <span class="Italic">Salisbury v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120072505 (Aug. 16, 2007) (attendance at Saturday evening service was a preference and not a religious obligation); <span class="Italic">Nesbitt v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 011996248 (Sep. 19, 2000) (agency not under an obligation to provide complainant with a religious accommodation to attend teaching services and choir practices). As such, the Agency was not under an obligation to provide Complainant with an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50280 (2005), the Commission signaled a departure from <span class="Italic">Nesbitt</span> in a case involving the wearing of a kufi. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the complainant, a Muslim, had a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief, i.e., wearing a kufi was religious wear and followed the ways of the prophet Mohammad. While the complainant testified that he was not obligated to wear the kufi, he did so as part of his <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief. The AJ cited <span class="Italic">Nesbitt v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01996248 (September 19, 2000), to support the conclusion that the agency need only accommodate the fundamental tenets of the religion, not the complainant's optional wearing of the kufi. However, <span class="Italic">Nesbitt</span> sought only to distinguish religious activity from other types of activity and did not rule that only the fundamental tenets of a religion need be accommodated. The wearing of a kufi conflicted with the agency's employment uniform policy, and the agency enforced this policy against the complainant. The complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious accommodation discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Yau v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A50063 (2006), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant, who was a Buddhist, by not permitting him leave to attend a religious training session. Although the training was not required as part of the complainant's religious practices or beliefs, it was required to maintain his special status within the religion. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Yau</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record further reflects that for several years, beginning in 1998, complainant had attended a two-week long Buddhist religious training conference, held annually, for which he requested, each year, to use his accrued annual leave. A conflict arose with his work schedule for the reason that the dates of the annual conference were not announced until April or May, while complainant was required to choose his vacation dates in November. Accordingly, complainant had selected dates in November 2001, that needed to be changed when complainant learned the actual dates for the 2002 conference dates. Complainant sought to change his vacation dates and ultimately, his leave request for 2002 was approved and complainant attended the conference as he had the previous year. However, in 2003, complainant's immediate supervisor (S1), who had approved his leave requests in prior years, was not authorized to approve his leave request for 2003. The Postmaster of the Burbank Post Office testified that she concurred with the decision of another supervisor (S2) who denied complainant's leave requests in 2003, because "there [were] no openings on the leave chart." Further, the Postmaster testified that she did not consider complainant's request to attend the conference a legitimate request for religious leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Postmaster's position, the AJ found that complainant did not consider his attendance at the annual religious conference to be optional, but rather a mandatory requirement of his religious practice, for which complainant properly sought accommodation. The AJ considered complainant's testimony regarding the commencement of his multi-year training to become a Buddhist Temple Master and Service Man and noted that his attendance at the conference was required of participants in the training program and those who maintained a temple in their home, which complainant and his wife did. Significantly, the AJ found that the agency made no showing that complainant's absence in 2003 (or any year prior) actually created an undue hardship; rather, the AJ found that complainant's request was denied solely because the agency did not deem complainant's request to be a request for religious accommodation. The AJ disagreed with the agency's characterization of complainant's request and found that the agency was obligated to meet complainant's religious needs, absent a showing of undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency again argues that attendance at the annual conference was properly characterized as an optional religious activity, which does not require the agency accommodation<span class="Italic">. Terry v. Small Business Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12512 (August 28, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, employers are required to accommodate the religious practices of their employees unless a requested accommodation is shown to impose an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(b)(l). The traditional framework for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on religious accommodation requires complainant to demonstrate that: (1) he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief, the practice of which conflicted with his employment; (2) he informed the agency of this belief and conflict; and (3) the agency nevertheless enforced its requirement against him. <span class="Italic">Baum v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A05985 (March 21, 2002) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"A refusal to accommodate is justified only when an employer...can demonstrate that an undue hardship would in fact result from each available alternative method of accommodation." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(c). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(d), alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes. In order to show undue hardship, an employer must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Baum</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A05985 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, as did the AJ, that complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious discrimination with respect to claim (2). Record evidence supports the AJ's finding that complainant's attendance at the annual conference was not an optional activity but a part of his religious observance and practice. We find the facts herein must be distinguished from those presented in either <span class="Italic">Nesbitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996248 (September 19, 2000) (where teaching and choir practice activities were considered optional activities and an accommodation of complainant's requests was deemed to create an undue hardship) or Terry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Nesbitt</span>, we note that the request for accommodation was a request for an on-going change to the weekly schedule so that complainant could participate in religious study and choir practice, at which complainant's attendance was voluntary and optional. Those facts, coupled with the significant disruption (numerous delivery routes would need to be changed) in the workplace that would be occasioned by accommodation of complainant's request, properly excused the agency from its obligation to otherwise accommodate complainant's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Terry,</span> we note that complainant requested that he be able to use compensatory time, as opposed to earned annual leave, in order to attend a religious conference described as including character assessment and training in complainant's pursuit of ordination. When he submitted a request to use annual leave, his request was granted. Our decision in Terry contains few other details regarding the nature of the conference by which we might assess its similarity to other religious conferences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, complainant demonstrated that he had historically attended the annual Buddhist conference every year since at least 1998, had created a temple in his own home, and had completed, together with his wife, a three-year program to become a Temple Master. Complainant testified that his attendance at the annual conference was mandatory as a condition of maintaining his temple and standing as a Temple Service Man, with continued training and participation at the national level. Further, complainant had earned the annual leave he intended to use, the agency was well aware of his religious needs (having accommodated him in previous years), and complainant was nonetheless denied the opportunity to change his vacation days to attend the two-week 2003 conference in New York.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, as did the AJ, that complainant's sincere belief that his attendance was mandatory is underscored by his willingness to risk his 17-plus year career to attend. Complainant knew that his leave was not granted before he left and that he faced discipline for being AWOL, in defiance of a direct order that he appear for his scheduled duty hours during the dates of the conference. We find substantial evidence to support the AJ's determination that complainant's attendance at the conference was an integral part of his religious practice, which in turn, obligated the agency to provide an accommodation, absent an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate his religious beliefs and, if such proof fails, the agency must show that the alternative means of accommodation proffered by complainant could not be granted without imposing an undue hardship on the agency's operations<span class="Italic">. Baum</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A05985 (citations omitted). Undue hardship may be shown where the costs of the proffered accommodation are more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or where such accommodation would deny another employee his job shift guaranteed by a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> seniority system. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01092 (June 29, 2001), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A10911 (Nov. 16, 2001); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here the agency failed to make a good faith effort to accommodate complainant's religious needs. Rather, the record reflects that complainant's initial request in 2003 was flatly denied because the agency did not recognize any duty to accommodate his request. The AJ found that when complainant's request to change his annual leave was granted, complainant was not required to switch with other employees and no evidence suggested the granting of leave to complainant caused any problems with the agency's operation. Record testimony indicates, on the contrary, that the agency took steps to prevent complainant from receiving approval for his 2003 leave request in the manner he had in previous years. Furthermore, the AJ found that the agency made no showing that complainant's absence in 2003 would have caused an undue hardship to the agency's Burbank operation.</p>
