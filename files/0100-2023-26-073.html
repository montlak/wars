<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-72"><span id="Page_1521"></span><span class="space">D.</span> CAUSAL CONNECTION</h3>
<p class="noindent">To prevail on a claim of reprisal, the employee must establish a causal connection, or nexus, between the protected activity and the resultant personnel action. In its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 (2016), the Commission sets forth "Examples of Facts that May Support Finding of Retaliation":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Different types or pieces of evidence, either alone or in combination, may be relevant to determine if the above causation standard has been met. In other words, different pieces of evidence, considered together, may allow an inference that the materially adverse action was retaliatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence may include, for example, suspicious timing, verbal or written statements, comparative evidence that a similarly situated employee was treated differently, falsity of the employer's proffered reason for the adverse action, or any other pieces of evidence which, when viewed together, may permit an inference of retaliatory intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Suspicious timing</span>. The causal link between the adverse action and the protected activity is often established by evidence that the adverse action occurred shortly after the plaintiff engaged in protected activity. However, temporal proximity is not necessary to establish a causal link. Even when the time between the protected activity and the adverse action is lengthy, other evidence of retaliatory motive may establish the causal link. For example, actions related to the continued processing of a complaint may remind an employer of its pendency or stoke an employer's animus. Moreover, an opportunity to engage in a retaliatory act may not arise right away. In these circumstances, a materially adverse action might occur long after the original protected activity occurs, and retaliatory motive is nevertheless proven.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Oral or written statements</span>. Oral or written statements made by the individuals recommending or approving the challenged adverse action may reveal retaliatory intent by expressing retaliatory animus or by revealing inconsistencies, pre-determined decisions, or other indications that the reasons given for the adverse action are false. Such statements may have been made to the employee or to others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Comparative evidence</span>. An inference that the adverse action was motivated by retaliation could also be supported by evidence that the employer treated more favorably a similarly situated employee who had not engaged in protected activity. For example, where a disciplinary action was taken for alleged retaliatory reasons, evidence of selective enforcement (i.e., that infraction regularly goes undisciplined in that workplace, or that another employee who committed the same infraction was not disciplined, or was not disciplined as severely) could be sufficient to infer retaliatory motive. Similarly, absent evidence of new performance problems, a retaliatory motive might be inferred where an employee had higher performance appraisals prior to engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Inconsistent or shifting explanations</span>. If the employer changes its stated reason for the challenged adverse action over time or in different settings (e.g., reasons stated to employee in termination meeting differ from reasons employer cites in position statement filed with the EEOC), pretext may be inferred. The inference of discrimination drawn from such changes, however, will be undermined to the extent the inconsistencies are innocuous or can be credibly explained by the employer (e.g., additional information is discovered).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Other evidence that employer's explanation was pretextual</span>. There may be other evidence that the employer's justification for the challenged action is not believable and that the explanation is a pretext to hide retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leora R. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120180736 (2019) (finding a causal connection where a supervisor reminded a new probationary employee of her employment status and told her to stop raising claims of race discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">As with intentional discrimination, there are two evidentiary methods of demonstrating retaliation: (1) circumstantial evidence; and (2) direct evidence. Each method is addressed in summary, below. The reader is referred to Chapter 10 subheadings "<a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-2">Circumstantial Evidence Cases</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-19-091.html#sec10-84">Direct Evidence or 'Mixed Motive' Cases</a>." It is improper for an agency to dismiss a reprisal complaint based on a determination regarding causal connection between protected activity and an adverse action. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Buck v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 01972011 (1998), such a determination goes to the merits of a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the entire record, the Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed allegation 3 of the appellant's October 4, 1996 complaint based on its view of the ultimate merit of the appellant's non-selection allegation. Similarly, the Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed retaliation as an alleged basis for the agency's actions based on its view that the appellant had not established a causal connection between his prior protected EEO activity and the alleged adverse actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants in cases under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act must prove that discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in a personnel action even if other, legitimate factors also motivated the action. The EEOC has taken the position that the standard for the degree to which reprisal is involved in a personnel action is akin to the contributing factor standard under the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1221(e)(1). The Commission's position is that the complainant prevails if he or she demonstrates that reprisal played any role in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge's determination of retaliatory intent is a factual finding and is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112516 (2015), the temporal proximity of the adverse treatment and the protected activity is not determinative of retaliatory intent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that the AJ made a factual finding that no retaliatory intent existed on the part of S1. Complainant failed to demonstrate that the AJ erred in making such a factual finding. Specifically, we find that the temporal proximity between Complainant's prior protected EEO activity and S1's actions, without more, is insufficient to prove pretext. In addition, we find that S1's testimony does not compel a finding of pretext. Although S1 testified that he was extremely upset about the EEO settlement, be clarified that he was not upset that he had to sign off on the settlement, but was upset that Complainant had slandered him and falsely accused him of being a liar. Hearing Transcript (Hr'g Tr.), at 165, 174. Although S1 testified that Complainant deserved to be fired, he was referring to Complainant's conduct (intentionally failing to deliver mail) that was the basis of the removal letter at issue in Complainant's prior EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 175-76, 200. Although S1 testified that he did not like Complainant, S1's dislike of Complainant is not proof of a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 174. We note that S1 also testified that the EEO settlement did not play any part in the street observations or the suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 165-66.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984354 (1999), the Commission remanded for further investigation and a new hearing, if requested, a case where the administrative judge found the agency was "primarily" motivated by the complainant's union activities in a series of actions taken against her. Although it remanded the case because it was unclear whether the complainant's union activities involved claims of discrimination, the Commission also held, in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, that the agency was liable if retaliation for activity protected under the antidiscrimination statutes played any role in the actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant argues that although it "may well be that the agency was primarily motivated by [her] union activism," she must prevail so long as she established that she filed prior EEO complaints, the relevant agency official was aware of the prior complaints, and she was subjected to an adverse action. Appellant fears that the agency will simply assert that any action taken against a union activist was based on such activism and, thus, escape liability for unlawful discrimination. She also contends that the agency's actions must have been at least partially influenced by her EEO complaints. In its comments on the appeal, the agency maintains that the RD correctly found that appellant was not subjected to retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as the AJ determined that appellant's treatment was "overwhelmingly related to her labor contract and union activities," the Commission notes that pursuant to Section 107 of the 1991 Civil Rights Act (42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m) and 20002-5(g)(2)(B), an unlawful employment practice is established whenever, race, color, religion, sex or national origin was a motivating factor, even though other factors also motivated the practice. Section 107 partially overrules <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 409 U.S. 228 (1989), which held that a respondent can avoid liability for intentional discrimination in mixed-motive cases if it can prove that it would have made the same decision in the absence of the discrimination. The Commission has determined that Section 107 also applies to claims of retaliation and, thus, retaliation is established even if the employer can prove that it would have taken the same action even absent retaliation<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even prior to the enactment of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Commission policy provided that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In retaliation cases, the Commission has taken the position that it will find liability and pursue injunctive relief whenever a retaliatory motive is a factor in an employment decision...The Commission...will...pursue relief whenever retaliation plays any role in an employment decision. This is because the Commission has a unique interest in protecting the integrity of its investigative process, and if retaliation were to go unremedied, it would have a chilling effect upon the willingness of individuals to speak out against employment discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory (March 7, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission agrees with appellant's argument that if the RD is interpreted as finding that her EEO activity played any part in her treatment by the agency, then she established that she was subjected to unlawful reprisal. However, the Commission finds that the RD is subject to more than one interpretation on this point. It is unclear whether the AJ misinterpreted the law or merely poorly expressed his findings in the RD, which were issued from the bench.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1522"></span>In addition, the AJ advised the parties that he did not "want a list or a record of [appellant's] EEO or union grievances" and, accordingly, the content of appellant's grievances is unknown. (In this regard, the Commission also notes that in addressing appellant's allegations of reprisal, the AJ considered only when various agency officials became aware of appellant's filing of EEO complaints.) However, the record as a whole indicates that appellant's grievances may well have included allegations that females were disparately treated in a variety of ways, including in the requirement to wear uniforms, the assignment of overtime, and other matters. If appellant's grievances included allegations of prohibited discrimination, even if the agency's treatment of appellant was motivated solely by appellant's union activity, such activity would have included opposition to unlawful practices, and appellant would be in a position to prevail on her claim of retaliation. Therefore, on remand, the agency shall place in the record sufficient information regarding the grievances filed by appellant to permit a determination of whether such grievances also raised allegations of prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not dispositive of a reprisal claim that the complainant believes the retaliation is for something other than protected EEO activity. In <span class="Italic">Keller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03119 (2003), the Commission rejected the findings of an administrative judge that the complainant had not demonstrated a case of reprisal because she believed the agency's actions were initially prompted by her grievances. "However, the fact that complainant believed that the RMO initially was not motivated by retaliatory animus with regard to EEO activity does not foreclose a finding that the RMO's subsequent actions were motivated by such animus." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In light of the fact that the supervisor proposed the complainant's removal only two days after her request for reasonable accommodation, the Commission found "that the RMO either created or seized upon the opportunity to remove complainant from employment for her protected activity two days prior." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary for a complainant to establish that the agency official taking the action has retaliatory motive, if the complainant demonstrates that another management official connected to the action has retaliatory motive. For example, in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40041 (2004), the Commission found that motive in the agency official recommending the action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we find that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation. As found by the AJ, while complainant's second-level Supervisor (S3) was not present at the facility on July 1, 2000, the record demonstrates that she had knowledge of complainant's prior EEO activity. The agency conceded in its appellate brief that S3 "had some knowledge of prior EEO activity of [complainant]." The record contains evidence that S3 testified that in March of 2000, she attended an unsuccessful redress mediation on an EEO complaint that complainant had filed against a facility Supervisor. Agency's Brief at 8. We further note that while S3 stated she was not aware of complainant's prior EEO activity, the AJ clearly found that her testimony was impeached. AJ's Decision at 5; Investigative Report at 261. The record establishes that on her return to work on July 5, 2000, S3 reviewed the statement of S2 detailing complainant's verbal threat against S1. IR at 201-2. Having no reason to question the veracity of S2's statement that complainant threatened S1, S3 signed the paper recording S1's placement of complainant in an EP, off-duty status. We note that complainant has not alleged that S3 retaliated against her, but rather stated in her formal complaint that S1 retaliated against her for asking for a light-duty assignment. However, after a consideration of the record, we find that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination as she engaged in prior EEO activity in March of 2000, which S3 was aware of. Further, complainant was subjected to an adverse agency activity when she was placed on an EP status, and the causal nexus was established as complainant's most recent formal complaint of discrimination was filed in May of 2000, two months before the events at issue occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As found by the AJ, the agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, namely that S1 placed complainant on an EP status as she believed complainant was behaving erratically on July 1, 2000 and she feared for her safety after being told by S2 that complainant had threatened her. However, we concur with the AJ's finding that complainant demonstrated that it was more likely than not that the agency's articulated reasons for its actions were a pretext for retaliation. In so finding, we defer to the credibility determinations of the AJ, who found that the overwhelming evidence supports complainant's version of events regarding the conversation between herself and S1 on July 1, 2000. The AJ noted that complainant and several witnesses stated that voices were not raised as the parties had their conversation, in contrast to the testimony of S1 who stated that complainant was acting erratically. In addition, the AJ noted that S2 denied telling S1 that complainant had verbally threatened her. AJ's Decision at 5; IR at 202. The AJ concluded that the agency was not truthful regarding the facts leading to complainant's being placed in an EP status.</p>
