<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-38"><span class="space">a.</span> Duty to Mitigate Damages</h5>
<p class="noindent">Title VII was not intended to produce windfall benefits to victims of discrimination. As such, complainants have a duty to mitigate--or lessen--damages by making a "reasonable...good faith effort to find other employment." <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01870096 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. Marsh</span>, 766 F.2d 490 (11th Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the <span class="Italic">Skaggs</span> decision predates the 1991 Civil Rights Act and its provision allowing compensatory damages in Title VII and Rehabilitation Act cases. Prior to that time, there were no "damages," as such in discrimination cases. The Commission used the term "damages" in its more general sense as it applies to back pay. As discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-30-188.html#sec21-177">Mitigation of Damages</a>," a "tortfeasor takes his victims as he finds them" and there is no duty to mitigate compensatory damages. The Commission still uses the phrase that a complainant "has a duty to mitigate damages," but this applies only to back pay, which is technically equitable relief and not damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency seeks to reduce a complainant's back pay award on the basis that the employee was not ready, willing, and able to work, the propriety of that action is judged by whether the complainant's actions are inconsistent with the legal obligation to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Skaggs</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Hanna v. American Motors Corp.</span>, 724 F.2d 1300 (7th Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue in <span class="Italic">Skaggs</span> was whether the complainant's enrollment in school during the time she challenged her termination evidenced an intent "to withdraw from the employment market...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission did not make it clear who bears the burden of proof in such cases. However, the Commission did make it clear that the complainant must show what efforts were made to secure employment during the period of school attendance, including a demonstration of what hours she was available for employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Three years later, the Commission held that it is the agency that has the burden of proving that the complainant failed to mitigate damages. "In this regard, the Commission notes that appellant is not required to actually find a suitable position, as long as she makes reasonable efforts to do so." <span class="Italic">Truran v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902296 (1990), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Coates v. National Cash Register Company</span>, 433 F. Supp. 655, 662 (W.D. Va. 1977). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Struppler v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120111119 (2013) (agency had burden of demonstrating that complainant was not entitled to "save pay" and "save grade" upon reinstatement).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will consider job opportunities in the complainant's area and the complainant's state of mind to determine whether the duty to mitigate was fulfilled. That was the case in <span class="italic">Kyle S. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2019005694 (2021), where the AJ ordered retroactive reinstatement but declined to award back pay. The complainant in <span class="italic">Kyle S. </span>appealed arguing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Complainant asks the Commission to reverse the AJ's denial of back pay, citing an error in fact and law. Complainant stated that the Agency has the burden to show a complainant failed to mitigate damages, and the Agency failed to do so here. Complainant stated that he attempted to obtain employment by speaking with the town Mayor about openings in the city, as well as the Undersheriff. Complainant stated that no one was receptive to hiring someone in litigation about employment termination. Complainant stated, as a result, he worked for his family's car wash and lube business. He stated that he earned &#x0024;29,875.16 in 2015, &#x0024;31,858.48 in 2016, and &#x0024;33,318.21 in 2017. Complainant stated that he entered the job market by working for his family business as they would have had to pay someone else to perform his duties. Complainant stated, "it shows that [he] was willing to do anything to earn an income for his family." Complainant stated that the AJ erred in assuming that applying for federal jobs is the only way to enter the job market. He stated that he lives in a small town and obtaining employment is different there, such that directly asking others about employment and working for a family business are appropriate. Complainant added, due to depression, withdrawal, and suicidal ideation, it was normal for him not to want to apply for other Agency positions. Complainant stated that the Agency failed to show that there were suitable positions available for which he was qualified and failed to apply.</p>
<p class="noindent">Crediting the complainant's argument in <span class="italic">Kyle S</span>., the Commission awarded back pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ erred in not awarding Complainant backpay. The Agency failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Complainant did not do enough to mitigate lost wages. The record shows that Complainant worked for his family's "business enterprise" and earned &#x0024;29,875.16 in 2015, &#x0024;31,858.48 in 2016, and &#x0024;33,318.21 in 2017. We find that Complainant is entitled to backpay from the effective date of termination to the date Complainant ceased working for and earning wages at his business enterprise or alternative outside employment, the date of reinstatement, or the date he declined reinstatement, whichever is earliest. We acknowledge that Complainant requested LWOP from July 22, 2014 through February 27, 2015 so that should be considered in backpay calculations, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency shall reinstate Complainant to the position of GS-9, Engineering Technician or a substantially equivalent position, at the grade and step where he would have been absent the discrimination. The Agency's job offer of reinstatement shall include a notice that, if Complainant either does not respond or declines the job offer within 15 days of receipt, his right to receive further back pay and other benefits based on the job offer shall terminate as of that date. If the offer is accepted, the Agency shall place Complainant into the position no later than 30 days from that date of acceptance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency shall determine the appropriate amount of back pay, with interest, and other benefits due Complainant, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501, no later than 60 calendar days from the date of this decision. Back pay shall be paid from the effective date of Complainant's termination in October 2014 through the date Complainant ceased working for and earning wages at his business enterprise or alternative <span id="Page_1724"></span>outside employment, the date of his reinstatement, or the date he declined reinstatement, whichever is earliest. The Complainant shall cooperate in the Agency's efforts to compute the amount of back pay and benefits due, and provide all relevant information requested by the Agency. If there is a dispute regarding the exact amount of back pay and/or benefits, the Agency shall issue a check to the Complainant for the undisputed amount within 60 calendar days of the date the Agency determines the amount it believes to be due. The Complainant may petition for enforcement or clarification of the amount in dispute. The petition for clarification or enforcement must be filed with the Compliance Officer, at the address referenced in the statement entitled "Implementation of the Commission's Decision."</p>
<p class="noindent">Several courts have rejected a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that full-time attendance at school demonstrates a failure to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Peyton v. DiMario</span>, 287 F.3d 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2002). However, in <span class="Italic">Kretschmar v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 04A20032 (2003), the Commission found that the complainant's attendance at college, even when it was on a fulltime basis, did not show a failure to mitigate damages. In <span class="Italic">Kretschman</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that it is not obligated to provide complainant back pay beyond one year since petitioner failed to mitigate her damages. Specifically, the agency argues that the record indicates that petitioner worked sporadically during the nine intervening years following discharge from the agency and up to the time of the EEOC's finding of discrimination and subsequent denial of the agency's request for reconsideration despite general availability of warehouse work in the commuting area. In addition, the agency argues that petitioner has conveyed that she voluntarily elected to attend college for much of the time during the intervening period. The agency argues that since petitioner elected to forego employment in favor of pursuing an education, it determined that she has failed to mitigate damages beyond the first year following her removal from the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the agency's position, the petitioner argues that she provided the agency detailed and sufficient evidence under oath (via response to the agency's propounded Interrogatories) necessary to prove that she took reasonable steps to mitigate her damages. Specifically, petitioner argues that the record shows that after diligently searching for a job making the same salary, complainant sought any employment at all in order to support herself. Petitioner provided the agency with several job rejection letters from various employers to support her contention that she diligently sought employment with a comparable salary. In addition, petitioner explained to the agency that she was required to submit at least 8 job applications each week while she was collecting unemployment benefits (at least one year) and that the unemployment benefits office retained complainant's job search records for verification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner further explained to the agency that her efforts to obtain comparable jobs were futile. Petitioner believed that the private sector was reluctant to hire women for forklift operator positions or other warehouse positions. Petitioner states she also attempted to obtain clerical jobs, but her skills were not very competitive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, petitioner explained that she had to resort to accepting a lower paying position at an American Indian gaming facility making change for gamblers. After two years in a position that petitioner found unhealthy, onerous and demeaning, she sought better employment. However, after six months of searching for a better job without a job offer, petitioner applied for financial aid and received a grant to go to college. Petitioner also immediately obtained part-time employment at the college she attended under a federal work program. During this time, petitioner stated that she searched for full-time jobs but to no avail. Petitioner explained to the agency that she would have quit college had she been offered a full-time job with comparable wages to her position with the agency. After being rejected by so many employers, complainant decided to attend college full-time, but continued to search for full-time jobs. While attending college, complainant worked additional part-time jobs during winter recess and presented workshops to faculty on Microsoft Word for which she was paid. In 2001, petitioner transferred to San Diego State University and obtained a higher paying part-time job. During this same year, petitioner notes that she received a favorable ruling by the Commission on her complaint of discrimination, but the agency failed to offer her unconditional reinstatement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A back pay claimant under Title VII generally has a duty to mitigate damages. Specifically, 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g) provides that "interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable." The burden is on the agency, however, to establish that the employee failed in her duty to mitigate. The Commission has generally held that an agency must satisfy a two-prong test to carry its burden of proof; this test requires the agency to show: (1) that petitioner failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position, and (2) that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which he or she was qualified. Where a complainant makes no effort to mitigate damages and does not explain the lack of effort, the agency does not have to meet the second prong.<span class="Italic"> See McNeil v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04990007 (December 9, 1999), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Simmons v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04930005 (December 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency has offered no evidence whatsoever in support of its position that complainant failed to mitigate her damages. In addition, we find that the petitioner responded to the agency's Interrogatories in a manner sufficient to prove that she took reasonable efforts to obtain comparable work, but was unable to do so. Accordingly, we find that the agency has failed to prove that complainant failed to mitigate her damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">To further clarify this area, Part 1614 specifically provides that the agency must bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee failed to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(d).</p>
<p class="noindent">In its section-by-section analysis, which accompanies the 1992 notice of final rulemaking, the Commission explained its rejection of agency objections to this regulation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several agencies raised objections to the requirement that agencies carry the burden of proving failure to mitigate. Case law places the failure to mitigate burden upon employers. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sellers v. Delgado Community College</span>, 839 F.2d 1132, 1139 (5th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. School Bd., City of Norton, Va.</span>, 659 F.2d 951, 959 (4th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc.</span>, 20 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1345, 1358 (10th Cir. 1979); <span class="Italic">Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 517 F.2d 387, 392 (7th Cir. 1975). Moreover, evidence of failure to mitigate is easily obtained during the agency investigation or during discovery associated with the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hubert v. Postmaster General</span>, 04920004 (1992), the Commission set forth the specific burden of proof an agency must meet in demonstrating that a complainant has failed to mitigate damages. The agency must demonstrate that the complainant did not use reasonable diligence in seeking alternative employment and also must demonstrate that alternative employment was available. The Commission determined in <span class="Italic">Hubert</span> that Title VII, and not agency regulations, govern back pay awards, including mitigation requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we disagree with the agency's contention that backpay awards under Title VII are controlled by Postal Service regulations. In a previous decision, the Commission explained that Title VII provides for make whole remedies, and noted numerous courts have awarded backpay against the Postal Service under Title VII. Under the statutes administered by this Commission, the Commission is empowered to issue orders, instructions and regulations as it deems necessary to effectuate the remedial purposes of the statutes. Regarding backpay awards, the Commission has, pursuant to Title VII and 29 CFR 1613.271, followed the regulation at 5 CFR 550.805 which sets forth a method of backpay computation. The agency may not erect a set of regulations which acts as a shield or limitation on the extent of its liability under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ann C. Ferguson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880848 (May 8, 1990). The Commission has repeatedly reaffirmed this principle. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bobby D. Jefcoat v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900261 (August 27, 1990) and <span class="Italic">Joseph I. Sellman v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04910001 (November 16, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, a backpay claimant under Title VII has a duty to mitigate damages by making a reasonable effort to find other suitable employment. Specifically, 706(g) of Title VII, 42 USC 2000e-5(g) provides "interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable." (footnote omitted). The burden is on the employer, however, to establish that the employee failed to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">Sangster v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 633 F.2d 864, 868 (9th Cir. 1980) and <span class="Italic">Patricia L. Truran v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901087 (December 28, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To satisfy this burden, the agency must show: (1) that petitioner failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position, and (2) that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which he was qualified. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Pacific Press Publishing Ass'n.</span>, 482 F. Supp. 1291, 1371 (N.D. Cal. 1979) and <span class="Italic">William Rhodes v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04900002 (January 4, 1990). We find that the agency failed to meet both prongs of this test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency failed to show petitioner did not make a reasonable effort to find other employment. Petitioner registered for employment with the Michigan Employment Security Commission, and submitted a list of eighteen different employers from which he sought or obtained jobs. The list likely is not complete because petitioner only has fragmentary records. Petitioner stated that because he needed to earn money to pay his home mortgage and other expenses, he perpetually made every effort to find employment, but was only able to secure temporary part-time jobs at low wages. Petitioner submitted seven W-2 wage and tax statements by six different employers for 1989 and 1990, and pay stubs indicating he was paid at hourly rates of &#x0024;6.10 with one employer and &#x0024;4 with another employer. As with any job search, it is more likely than not <span id="Page_1725"></span>that before obtaining all these jobs, petitioner received many rejections from prospective employers. The record corroborates petitioner's position that he made a reasonable and diligent effort to find employment during the backpay period. Moreover, given petitioner's demonstrated effort to find employment, and the effect of the termination on his work record, petitioner's statement that he was unable to find higher paying steady employment is credible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Muldrew v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.</span>, 728 F.2d 989, 992 (8th Cir. 1984) (given, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the effect of plaintiff's discharge on his work record, defendant did not meet its burden of proving failure to mitigate damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Mercy Peninsula Ambulance Service, Inc.</span>, 589 F.2d 1014 (9th. Cir. 1979), the agency argues that the number of petitioner's attempts to secure employment were insufficient to establish that he sought employment with reasonable diligence. In <span class="Italic">Mercy</span>, the employee was unemployed for nine months. He contacted or visited approximately three employers per month, but several of those contacts appeared half-hearted. The employee also registered with the Employment Security Office apparently in order to collect unemployment benefits, and spent a considerable amount of time promoting an ambulance driver's association. The employee in the <span class="Italic">Mercy</span> case also wrote someone that when he was first fired it would have been easy to walk away and get a better job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the instant case is factually distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Mercy</span>. In the <span class="Italic">Mercy</span> case, the employee admitted he could have secured a better job around the time he was removed. Whereas the employee in the <span class="Italic">Mercy</span> case appears to have registered with the Employment Security Office in order to receive unemployment benefits, petitioner was still registered with Michigan Employment Security Commission long after his state unemployment compensation expired. Thus, petitioner's motivation for registering with the Michigan Employment Security Commission is not in doubt. Also, petitioner's repeated acceptance of employment offers during the backpay period shows his efforts to find a job were sincere, not half-hearted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also failed to satisfy the second prong of its burden, which is to show there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which he was qualified. Suitable, or substantially comparable positions are those with compensation, promotional opportunities, job responsibilities, working conditions and job status which are similar to the position discriminatorily lost. <span class="Italic">Sellers v. Delgado Community College</span>, 839 F.2d 1132, 1138 (5th Cir. 1988). The help wanted newspaper ads submitted by the agency did not reflect that comparable positions were available. Accordingly, based on the above discussions, the agency has failed to meet its burden that petitioner did not mitigate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII explicitly provides that interim earnings during the backpay period shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable. Petitioner earned wages on an intermittent basis from various employers during the backpay period. The agency is entitled to deduct these earnings from the backpay award. Petitioner is required to fully cooperate with the agency's good faith efforts to determine the proper amount of backpay due. <span class="Italic">Sorce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912228. In the instant case, this requires petitioner to provide, to the best of his ability, documentation [of his interim] earnings. This includes tax returns, W-2s, pay stubs, and/or a written statement concerning how much wages he earned. If petitioner does not have complete documentation in his possession, he should make every reasonable effort to secure and/or assist the agency in securing the documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that an agency's failure to notify a complainant of his failure to mitigate damages does not absolve the complainant of that obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0720150003 (2015), provides a good example of both a complainant's efforts to mitigate damages and his subsequent failure to do so:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the four-year period of 2006 to 2010, the AJ's finding that Complainant mitigated his back pay is supported by substantial evidence. The AJ credited Complainant's testimony that he diligently searched for employment during this period by registering for work with translation and tourist companies, applying for jobs with them, and getting placed on translation lists of several linguistic organizations, which resulted in some short-term project work. HT, Complainant, 39-44.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, the AJ's finding that Complainant failed to mitigate his back pay from 2010 to 2012 is supported by substantial evidence. The AJ found that Complainant admitted he did not engage in a diligent search or work between 2010 and 2012. When Complainant was asked if he searched for a job during this period, he testified that he did, but not very strongly, and that he was discouraged. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 41. Complainant also ceased collecting unemployment insurance benefits sometime in 2010, which had previously provided him with an incentive to search for work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 143-144.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the availability of employment, the AJ approvingly recounted the Assistant Section Chief's testimony that Complainant's prospects for finding work were good in the intelligence community based on his top security clearance and being certified in five different languages. HT, Assistant Section Chief, at 51-52. The Assistant Section Chief explained that an organization would only need to get one security clearance in order to gain the ability of five linguists, making Complainant extremely marketable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Citing Complainant's testimony, the AJ found that he did not apply for translation jobs at logical employers for someone with his qualifications, including state and other federal agencies, healthcare providers, and federal and state courts. HT, Complainant, at 116-117. The AJ found that nevertheless, his search efforts for the four-year period from 2006 to 2010 were sufficient to mitigate his back pay then. We find that the AJ's findings regarding mitigation are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that in addition to the complainant's admission that he did not seek work after 2010, the agency also was required to prove that suitable employment would have been available had the complainant made diligent efforts to look for work.</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast is <span class="Italic">Damon Q. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420130028 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the March 25, 2008 to October 12, 2012 time period, we find that the Agency improperly excluded it from the computation of back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that the Agency did not show that Petitioner failed to mitigate damages during that time period. A back pay claimant under Title VII has a duty to mitigate damages by making a reasonable effort to find other suitable employment. <span class="Italic">See Hubert v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04920004 (July 10, 1992). The burden is on the agency, however, to establish that the employee failed to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The Commission has generally held that an agency must satisfy the following two-prong test to meet its burden of proof: (1) the petitioner failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position; and (2) there were suitable positions available which the petitioner could have discovered and for which he was qualified. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Where a petitioner does not make an effort to mitigate damages and does not explain the lack of effort, the agency does not have to satisfy the second prong. <span class="Italic">See Simmons v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04930005 (Dec. 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency has not met its burden. Specifically, the record reflects that Petitioner sought employment with various employers (a medical company, the VA, a janitorial services company, a barber shop, an auto repair shop) and sought employment assistance from VA VR&#x0026;E. In addition, the record contains no evidence that there were other suitable positions available which Petitioner could have discovered and for which he was qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we find no reason to exclude that time period based on Petitioner's inability in work. To the extent that Petitioner was unable to work, the medical documentation in the record for EEOC Appeal No. 0120130887 reflects that it was linked to his discriminatory termination by the Agency. For example, a January 6, 2011 note from Petitioner's VA psychiatrist stated, "It is felt that patient's more severe depression resulting in patient's...inability to work...[was] significantly exacerbated and caused by the situation of unlawful termination at the [Agency]." Similarly, an October 19, 2012 letter from Petitioner's VA psychologist stated, "Although [Petitioner] suffered from Depression prior to his termination from the [Agency], the termination appeared to have aggravated and precipitated a significant worsening in his Depression to the Moderate and Severe Range and resulted in a significant increase in his service connected compensation award. Currently, he is unable to maintain gainful employment." Therefore, because the Agency's discriminatory termination caused Petitioner to be unable to work, we find that providing full relief to the Petitioner requires that we decline to limit the time period for back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an apparently never-ending effort to avoid the issuance of back pay in any case in which it has been found to discriminate against its employees, the U.S. Postal Service continued to assist the Commission in defining and refining the agency's burden of proof in mitigation cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">Todd v. Postmaster General</span>, 04920007 (1992), the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Order in <span class="Italic">Gloria D. Todd v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01900309 (June 11, 1990), <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, directed the agency to award petitioner backpay, interest on backpay and other benefits she would have received for the period from the date of her termination to the date that she was reinstated. The only issue before us now is whether the agency properly denied petitioner backpay, interest on backpay and other benefits for the period from July 14, 1986 through June 11, 1990 based on petitioner's purported failure to mitigate damages. For the reasons explained below, we find that the agency failed to meet its burden of proof on the mitigation issue and that the agency owes petitioner backpay, interest on backpay and benefits from the date in August 1986 that petitioner first contacted the Michigan Employment Security Commission or the Vocational Rehabilitation Service seeking assistance in obtaining employment, through June 11, 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission awarded petitioner backpay pursuant to its authority under 505(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 USC <span id="Page_1726"></span>794a(a)(1). Therein, Congress established that the remedy provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, apply to violations of the Rehabilitation Act. Section 706(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC 2000e-5 (g), provides that amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable. Thus, petitioner had a duty under the Rehabilitation Act to exercise reasonable diligence to mitigate damages. She was not required, however, to seek another line of work, to accept a demotion or to take a demeaning position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 458 U.S. 219, 231 (1982). Nor was she required to seek or accept employment located an unreasonable distance from her home. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spagnuolo v. Whirlpool Corp</span>., 717 F.2d 114, 119 (4th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Rasimas v. Michigan Dep't of Mental Health</span>, 714 F.2d 614, 625 (6th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Madison Courier Inc.</span>, 472 F. 2d 1307, 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1972). Petitioner was required to seek substantially equivalent positions, that is, positions that afforded virtually identical promotional opportunities, compensation, job responsibilities, working conditions and status as the position from which petitioner was discriminatorily terminated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc</span>., 922 F.2d 1515, 1527 (11 Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Sellers v. Delgado Community College</span>, 839 F.2d 1132, 1138 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency, not petitioner, has the burden of proof on the issue of mitigation. The agency must prove that petitioner failed to exercise reasonable efforts to find work. In order to meet its burden, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the damage suffered by petitioner could have been avoided, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which she was qualified; and (2) petitioner failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking such a position. <span class="Italic">Ann C. Ferguson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912608 (December 16, 1991); <span class="Italic">Patricia L. Truran v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901087 (December 28, 1990). The reasonableness of petitioner's diligence must be evaluated in light of the individual characteristics of the petitioner and the job market. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sellers v. Delgado Community College</span>, 53 FEP Cases 127, 130 (5th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Rasimas v. Michigan Dep't of Mental Health</span>, 714 F.2d at 642.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency disallowed backpay for the period from July 15, 1986 to June 11, 1990, based on petitioner's purported lack of diligence in seeking to mitigate damages. The agency reviewed petitioner's submissions and concluded that they did not demonstrate the requisite mitigation. In effect, the agency shifted the burden of proving reasonable diligence to the petitioner. We reach a different conclusion than the agency in this case because we hold the agency to its burden of proving failure to mitigate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the agency has to prove that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which she was qualified. We find, for the reasons indicated below, that the agency failed to prove that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which she was qualified. The agency submits copies of help-wanted ads in order to meet its burden. However, the agency does not identify the ads which it claims proves that there were suitable positions available. The agency merely contends summarily that "(t)o obtain a position substantially equivalent to a Cleaner should not have been unduly difficult" and that the "ads indicate that substantially equivalent employment was readily available in the area."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the Detroit ads finds no cleaning-worker positions advertised. Thus, the Detroit ads indicate that there were few, if any, cleaning-worker positions available in Detroit during the backpay period at issue. As to the Ann Arbor ads, the agency presents no evidence that Ann Arbor, Michigan, is within reasonable commuting distance of petitioner's home. Without such evidence, we cannot conclude that petitioner should have sought employment in Ann Arbor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even assuming that Ann Arbor is within reasonable commuting distance from petitioner's home, we do not conclude, based on the ads alone, that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which she was qualified. The Ann Arbor ads included several ads for custodians, cleaning personnel, housekeepers, and janitors. The agency presents no evidence, however, that the advertised positions were substantially equivalent to the agency's cleaner position regarding promotional opportunities, compensation, job responsibilities, working conditions and status. Those ads that listed wages indicated wages substantially below what petitioner had earned at the agency. The agency also presents no evidence that petitioner could have performed the particular duties of the advertised positions within her physical limitations. As to the agency's contention that it should not have been unduly difficult for petitioner to obtain employment, we further note that the agency, itself, chose not to rehire petitioner. Moreover, her employment search was impeded by the very fact that the agency had terminated her employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the agency has to prove that petitioner failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position for which she was qualified. We find that the agency failed to make such a showing and that petitioner's efforts were sufficiently diligent. Petitioner registered with the Michigan Employment Security Commission and the Vocational Rehabilitation Service in August 1986, seeking assistance in obtaining employment. She also sought information about job opportunities from friends, former employers and other people with whom she interacted. Moreover, she contacted at least forty-five potential employers, a number of which she contacted repeatedly. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Snyder Buick, Inc.</span>, 794 F.2d 1228, 1234 (7th Cir. 1986) (a diligent complainant seeking to mitigate damages would check the want ads, register with employment agencies and discuss job opportunities with friends and acquaintances).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not know whether or not petitioner regularly checked the Detroit help-wanted ads for job openings. However, given the lack of cleaning positions in the Detroit help-wanted ads submitted to the Commission by the agency, we conclude that reading the help-wanted ads would not have facilitated petitioner's obtaining a cleaning position. In addition, we find that petitioner reasonably supplemented her inquiries to friends and acquaintances with direct contacts with potential employers, whether or not the employers had advertised job openings. Here, petitioner contacted at least forty-five potential employers during the forty-nine month backpay period at issue. Moreover, petitioner contacted a number of the potential employers several times. Furthermore, petitioner obtained one job, thus indicating that she was seeking work. We conclude that petitioner's efforts were at least as diligent as that of the petitioner in <span class="Italic">William Rhodes v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04900002 (January 4, 1990) (agency failed to establish that petitioner did not exercise reasonable diligence in his efforts to seek employment as a custodian). In the latter case, the petitioner registered with the St. Louis Division of Employment Security and contacted thirty-five potential employers during a forty-one month period, from January 18, 1986 through June 8, 1989, but was able to find only two temporary jobs, each of which lasted only a month and one-half.</p>
<p class="noindent">On occasion, a complainant whose employment has been terminated decides to attend school to improve his or her chances at finding a new job. The mere enrollment in school does not exhibit an intent to abandon the search for employment and, generally speaking, an agency still has to fulfill its burden of proving both prongs of the mitigation test. However, the rule is not so bright-line that the Commission will not look at underlying facts to determine whether the complainant has abandoned the job market. If so, then the agency does not have to prove that there were suitable positions available.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Postmaster General</span>, 04930005 (1993), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, a backpay claimant has a duty to mitigate damages by making a reasonable effort to find other suitable employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nord v. U.S. Steel Corp.</span>, 758 F.2d 1462, 1470 (11th Cir. 1985). The burden is on the employer, however, to establish that the employee failed in her duty to mitigate. <span class="Italic">William Rhodes v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04900002 (January 4, 1990). The Commission has generally held that an agency must satisfy a two-prong test to carry its burden of proof; this test requires the agency to show: 1) that petitioner failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position, and 2) that there were suitable positions available which petitioner could have discovered and for which he or she was qualified. <span class="Italic">Angelo Hubert v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04920004 (July 10, 1992). In one case, the Commission determined that an agency must satisfy both parts of the test in order to escape liability. <span class="Italic">Milton Paolozzi v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920423 (August 3, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency has carried its burden of proof regarding the first part of the test. We agree with the agency that petitioner took herself out of the job market when she enrolled in college. Enrollment in college, by itself, does not necessarily constitute a failure to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">Barbara J. Larsen v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921536 (March 11, 1993). <span class="Italic">Accord</span>, <span class="Italic">Washington v. Kroger Co.</span>, 671 F.2d 1072, 1079 (8th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Hanna v. American Motors Corp.</span>, 724 F.2d 1300, 1308 (7th Cir. 1984). Here, however, petitioner attended college for over two years and during that time apparently made no attempt to find employment. As the agency points out, petitioner submitted no documentation, nor did she ever assert, that she even attempted to find employment. We find that the agency gave petitioner adequate opportunity to show that she made reasonable efforts to find employment. Based on these facts, the Commission finds that petitioner did not exercise due diligence in seeking employment during the period in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have considered the fact that the agency rests entirely on its proof of the first prong of the test. No documentation was submitted going to the second prong, to show the existence of available, suitable positions that petitioner might have found had she searched. The agency has cited to <span class="Italic">Miller v. Marsh</span>, 766 F.2d 490 (11th Cir. 1985) and <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Safeway Stores, Inc.</span>, 524 F.2d 263 (10th Cir. 1975) in its opposition to petitioner's <span id="Page_1727"></span>petition. In <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, the plaintiff was found to have voluntarily removed herself from the job market when she enrolled in law school and made no effort to seek employment. In the earlier <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> case, the Court upheld the lower court's decision to exclude from the backpay period the time plaintiff spent in school, without considering appellant's assertions that he attempted to find work during that time. We surmise that the agency relied on these cases in deciding not to submit proof going to the second part of its evidentiary test, as neither case examined the question of whether suitable positions were available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the agency had relied solely on petitioner's college attendance, as did the Court in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, the Commission would not withdraw the second prong of the test from the agency's burden of proof. As we stated above, enrollment in college is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">Larsen</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. However, the agency also relies on petitioner's apparent failure to even seek employment. In that regard, we have considered petitioner's statement that she needed the schooling in order to find a suitable position, a statement which she presumably offers to explain why she made no effort to seek employment. The Commission concludes that given her lack of effort, petitioner's statement is unsupported and conclusory. We find that petitioner voluntarily abandoned the job market when she enrolled in college. She therefore differed from plaintiffs in cases in which courts have granted backpay for periods of college attendance. In these cases, the courts focused on whether the plaintiffs diligently tried to find work while attending school. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Brady v. Thurston Motor Lines, Inc.</span>, 753 F.2d 1269 (4th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Piekarski v. Home Owners Savings Bank, F.S.B.</span>, 752 F. Supp. 1451 (D. Minn. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since petitioner made no effort to mitigate damages and because she has not explained her lack of effort, requiring the agency to also prove that positions were available would be illogical and unnecessary. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the agency did not have to satisfy the second prong of the mitigation test. There is support for our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Sellers v. Delgado College</span>, 902 F.2d 1189 (5th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 111 S. Ct. 525 (1990); <span class="Italic">reh</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 111 S. Ct. 804 (1991). In that case, the Court reiterated the holding of a preceding opinion in the case: "...if an employer proves that an employee has not made reasonable efforts to obtain work, the employer does not also have to establish the availability of substantially equivalent employment." We think that the <span class="Italic">Sellers</span> principle rather than the principle of <span class="Italic">Paolozzi</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, applies in this case. In <span class="Italic">Paolozzi</span>, the appellant was receiving workers compensation benefits, and argued that these were mitigation of the agency's damages. He had also testified that he did not seek employment because jobs for which he was qualified would not have paid more than the benefits. Thus, appellant in that case had proffered evidence that he had met his statutory duty to mitigate. In contrast, petitioner here made no effort to mitigate and moreover, failed to explain her lack of effort. The Commission finds that petitioner failed to mitigate damages during the period from February 16, 1989 through December 30, 1990, and is not entitled to backpay for that period.</p>
<p class="noindent">"As a backpay award is subject to mitigation...there is no reason for the Commission to specifically order that...entitlement to backpay cease as of the date" the employee accepts a new position. <span class="Italic">Castillo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05870535 (1988). Also, it is not necessary for the successful complainant to accept the offer of reinstatement in order to be entitled to back pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If, during the pendency of a complaint, the agency offers employment and the employee declines, this constitutes a failure to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See Jeanmarie v. Postmaster General</span>, 05870360 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1982677458us2191672">458 U.S. 219</a> (1982)). However, the offer must be unconditional. In a case where an employee is offered a medical examination with the prospect of receiving a position if the results of the examination are favorable, the employee is not required to accept the offer because the offer is not unconditional. The agency may limit its back pay liability by renewing the conditional job offer pending a medical examination. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Collick-Brown v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05900642 (1990) (an offer of employment is not unconditional when it is premised upon withdrawal of a complaint). When a complainant rejects a proposed agency settlement offer that includes a promotion, the agency is justified in unilaterally implementing the promotion in order to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01930309 (1993). When a complainant rejects an unconditional offer of reemployment, his right to back pay is terminated as the date of that offer. <span class="Italic">See Hardee v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05A10657 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a complainant does not accept a job offer in relief after prevailing on a complaint, this may also be construed as a failure to mitigate damages that cuts off the entitlement to back pay. In the same case, the Commission also found that the agency was justified in seeking a deposition of the complainant and demanding he bring financial documents to the deposition after failing to provide evidence of efforts to mitigate his damages in response to agency requests. In <span class="Italic">Bedynak-Stumm v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120111340 (2011), the Commission found that the agency's first two offers of employment were not substantially equivalent, but the third offer was and the failure of the complainant to accept it cut off his entitlement to back pay. The Commission also indicated in <span class="Italic">Bedynak-Stumm</span> that if the complainant continued to fail to cooperate on back pay calculations, that might discharge the agency's obligation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A back pay claimant under Title VII generally has a duty to mitigate damages. This also applies to the ADEA. <span class="Italic">Sorce v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01912228 (Nov. 18, 1991). Specifically, Section 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g) provides that "interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable." The burden is on the agency, however, to establish that the employee failed m his duty to mitigate. The Commission has generally held that an agency must satisfy a two-prong test to meet its burden of proof. This test requires the agency to show that: (1) complainant failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position, and (2) there were suitable positions available which complainant could have discovered and for which he or she was qualified. <span class="Italic">See McNeil v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04990007 (Dec. 9, 1999), <span class="Italic">citing Simmons v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04930005 (Dec. 10, 1993). Where a complainant makes no effort to mitigate damages and does not explain the lack of effort, the agency does not have to meet the second prong.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In EEOC Appeal No. 0720060054 (Feb. 20, 2008), the Commission ordered the Agency to offer to retroactively place Complainant in the position of Veterans Readjustment Specialist, GS-9, and directed that he had 15 days from receipt of the offer to accept or decline it. The Commission ordered that failure to accept the offer within 15 days will be considered a declination of the offer. The Agency complied with this order in its employment offer to Complainant dated August 1, 2008. As will be detailed below, this offer was made at the correct grade and step level, and with the correct start date. Complainant's failure to accept this offer constituted a declination of a proper offer. Accordingly, under the order in EEOC Appeal No. 0720060054, the Agency is no longer obligated to make any further offers of employment to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its August 15, 2008 FAD, the Agency conceded that its first two offers of employment to Complainant did not comply with the Commission's order because they were deficient. We agree, since the Agency offered Complainant a GS-7/9 position, when he was discriminatorily denied a GS-719111 position. Given the different potential grade levels, we find the positions were not substantially equivalent. Complainant argues that he did not accept any of the three offers of employment because they were deficient. If he wished to avail himself of the opportunity to work for the Agency under the Commission's order, he was obligated to mitigate his damages by accepting the third offer. Even if his objections about the start date and step level were correct, which they were not, the third offer would still substantially comply with the EEOC's order, triggering the duty to mitigate if he wished to work at the Agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Bivens v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05890476 (April 3, 1990). The Commission retains jurisdiction to enforce its orders, and mitigating damages by accepting a job offer does not deprive the Commission of this jurisdiction to correct enforcement details.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also variously argues that if he was non-discriminatorily hired, he would have been a GS-11, step 7 or 12 by 2008. We disagree. The Commission found discrimination based on the action of the selecting officials, not Complainant's placement on hiring certificate as a GS-9 by the Agency's Human Resources Management Service In fact, we ordered that the Agency offer to retroactively hire Complainant at the GS-9 level. Given this, and the time it would take to progress one grade level and successive step levels, we find that the Agency's third offer was properly at the grade of GS-11, and step of 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that if he was non-discriminatorily hired, it would have been effective April 22, 2004. On the hiring certificate, the selecting official indicated he chose the selectee and wished to have the position filled on May 3, 2004, a Monday. She was hired effective May 2, 2004, the first day of the pay period. Given this, and that Complainant has not identified documentary evidence pointing to an earlier likely hiring date, we find that the Agency has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that had Complainant been non-discriminatorily hired, it would have been effective May 2, 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the back pay period is from May 2, 2004, through August 20, 2008, i.e., from the effective date Complainant would have started had he been non-discriminatorily hired to the effective date he declined the third offer of employment which complied with the Commission's order. The August 20, 2008, date is arrived at as follows: the third offer gave Complainant 15 days to accept or decline, and additional time for the offer to arrive to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Up to this point, the Agency has been in compliance with the back pay portion of the order in EEOC Appeal No. 0720060054. Under our order, Complainant is required to cooperate with the Agency's efforts to compute back pay and benefits due, and provide all relevant information requested by the Agency. He contends that he did this by advising the Agency he had no employment or taxable income during the back pay period. We disagree. The Agency has a right to copies of any documents to which Complainant has access which would verify his claims, and <span id="Page_1728"></span>which would otherwise show he was ready, willing, and able to perform his duties during the back pay period and met his duty to mitigate damages. Complainant's resume indicated that he was self employed, and he contends he had material "to exemptions under IRS laws."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with Complainant's contention that the Agency did not have authority to require him to submit to a deposition. Given Complainant's unclear writings and failure to submit any documentation, a sworn deposition with instruction to bring all relevant documents in his possession would be a useful tool to get the information needed from Complainant on whether he was ready, willing, and able to perform his duties during the back pay period, and met his duty to mitigate. If Complainant responds to deposition questions to the best of his ability, his fear of entrapment is unjustified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency's failure to pay back pay has been caused by Complainant's failure to cooperate, interest on any back pay paid stopped accruing on August 20, 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Should Complainant cooperate, the Agency's obligation to pay back pay would resume. At some point, which we need not decide here, if Complainant continues in his complete failure to cooperate, the Agency's duty to pay back pay will be discharged.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there is not total agreement on whether an employee must accept an alternative offer of employment in order to mitigate damages. In <span class="Italic">Boehms v. TVA</span>, 139 F.3d 452 (5th Cir. 1998), the court found that the employee complied with his duty to mitigate damages, despite refusal of positions that became available within the agency. The court in <span class="Italic">Boehms</span> found that the employee was not given the opportunity to continue in his existing employment relationship with the agency, where his division was abolished and he was offered lesser alternative employment. The court in <span class="Italic">Boehms</span>, 139 F.3d at 460, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the basis of our holding that "where an employer discriminatorily denies promotion to an employee, that employee's duty to mitigate damages encompasses remaining on the job," <span class="Italic">Jurgens v. EEOC</span>, 903 F.2d 386, 389 (5th Cir. 1990), defendants contend that Boehms failure to continue his "existing employment relationship" with TVA--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, by refusing each of the operations manager positions that became available after his nonselection--constituted a breach of his duty to mitigate damages. We reject this argument, simply on the basis that Boehms--unlike a typical nonselectee for a promotion--did not have the option to remain in his "existing employment relationship." As discussed, the position of Tupelo district manager, Boehms' post for over two years, was being eliminated pursuant to TVA's reorganization implementing customer service centers. The operations manager position, although it would allow Boehms to "remain on the job" in some sense, brought with it only a subset of the supervisory and budgetary responsibilities of the former district manager position. In such circumstances, we find that it was impossible for Boehms to "remain [in his existing] job," and therefore, we decline to apply our holding in <span class="Italic">Jurgens</span> to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Boehms</span> also rejected the agency's argument that the employee was required to accept any position that would be an improvement over his participation in the agency's temporary placement program. The court in <span class="Italic">Boehms</span>, 139 F.3d at 460, stated that the employee's job in which the discrimination occurred was the proper basis for determining reasonable alternative employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Defendants next contend that if in fact Boehms' nonselection to the position of CSC manager was aged-based discriminatory, Boehms' damage award should reflect his subsequent failure to diligently seek replacement employment<span class="Italic">. See Sellers v. Delgado Community College</span>, 839 F.2d 1132, 1139 (5th Cir. 1988) ("If an employer proves that an employee has not made reasonable efforts to obtain work, the employer does not have to establish the availability of substantially comparable work."). Defendants argue that once Boehms voluntarily entered the ETP, a position without supervisory responsibilities or an operating budget, he had a duty--under the "reasonable efforts" standard--to accept any employment that would "better" his position from that in the ETP. According to defendants, Boehms breached this duty, and thus failed to mitigate his damages, by "steadfastly refus[ing]" to accept any of the several operations manager positions that became available while he was in the ETP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unimpressed by this argument, as it would lead to the untenable result that a claimant in Boehms' position must accept almost any position that becomes available while participating in a temporary employee assistance program--provided it qualifies, as it likely will, as an improvement over his position therein. This court has noted, in the context of a Title VII failure to promote case (sex discrimination), that a claimant breaches his duty to "exercise reasonable diligence to minimize damages," and "forfeits his right to backpay[,] if he refuses a job substantially equivalent to the one he was <span class="Italic">discriminatorily denied.</span>" <span class="Italic">E.E.O.C. v. Exxon Shipping Co.</span>, 745 F.2d 967, 977 (5th Cir. 1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. E.E.O.C.</span>, 458 U.S. 219, 232 102 S. Ct. 3057, 3065, 73 L. Ed.2d 721) (1982) (emphasis added). Therefore, our focus in a mitigation analysis--and the base from which all comparisons about whether "reasonable efforts" to obtain comparable work are made--must be the employment position with respect to which discrimination occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Defendants' contention that Boehms was required to accept any employment that would "better" his position from that in the ETP is therefore meritless under our holding in <span class="Italic">Exxon Shipping</span>. We have already determined under the instant facts that Boehms was discriminatorily denied the position of Tupelo CSC manager. Defendant's brief makes no claim that Boehms failed to use reasonable efforts to seek substantially similar or "better" employment <span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> the denied CSC manager position. After a careful review of the record, we are convinced that the magistrate did not commit clear error in finding (1) that Boehms' duty to mitigate damages was satisfied by his participation in the ETP, and (2) that this duty was not breached by his refusal to accept any operations manager positions during the ensuing six-month period.</p>
<p class="noindent">When there is a dispute over the scope of relief, particularly with respect to the position offered to the complainant or its location, the complainant still has a duty to mitigate damages while the dispute is being resolved. In most cases, in order to properly mitigate damages, the complainant is required to accept the position, report to work, and pursue the issue of an appropriate remedy through the Commission's appellate procedures. However, there are limited circumstances in which a complainant is justified in accepting the position and refusing to report to work without the refusal being deemed a declination of the offer. But, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01891868 (1989), the Commission held that it may toll the agency's back pay liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have found under some circumstances where an offer was defective, an appellant's acceptance of the offer, but failure to report on the starting date, did not result in the declination of the offer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Om Parkash Kalra</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890987. Factors that we found most persuasive in that case were: (1) that the offer was not in strict compliance with 29 CFR 1613.271(b)(1); (2) that the offer was not made until about 10 months after the oriGINAl finding of discrimination; (3) the agency still had not issued a final decision on any of the relief and appellant had no appeal rights. These three factors, taken together with the fact that the offer required the appellant to relocate himself and his family, made the appellant's acceptance of the job, but refusal to report, reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, under some circumstances, we might find an appellant's acceptance of a position, but failure to report until a FAD was issued, to be reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that an individual victim of discrimination has a duty to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 2000e-5(g); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. The Madison Courier, Inc.</span>, 472 F.2d 1307 (D.C. Cir. 1972). The unconditional offer of a job previously denied to a victim of discrimination may toll the continuing accrual of backpay liability. Absent special circumstances, backpay liability is tolled when an individual rejects the job he oriGINAlly sought. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, 458 U.S. at 238, 239. Generally, acceptance of an unconditional job offer will toll backpay liability when the individual begins the job. However, acceptance of the job will not jeopardize the victim's rights to be made whole. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, 458 U.S. at 234. From this, we have found that if an individual accepts an unconditional job offer, but does not report for duty or delays the starting date, his or her action will toll the continuing accrual of backpay liability, absent special circumstances. Relocation may be a special circumstance which could be considered when deciding whether backpay liability has tolled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, 458 U.S. at 238 n.27; <span class="Italic">Om Parkash Kalra</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890987.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the accrual of backpay liability should be tolled by an appellant's failure to report to duty, the equities must be weighed. In <span class="Italic">Om Parkash Kalra</span>, we found that appellant's duty to mitigate damages extended to reporting to the job; it was reasonably apparent that he would get backpay even though the agency decision was not final, and that appellant, knowing he was entitled to full relief, would not jeopardize any make-whole benefits he was entitled to by starting the job. Therefore, we found that the agency's liability ceased on the report date, because the appellant sought a delay and did not report for duty. Similar considerations may be taken into account in the case such that if appellant fails to report for duty until the agency issues a proper Final Agency Decision on all specific remedies offered her, in accordance with the general make-whole remedies recommended by the AJ, appellant's refusal to report to duty might not be considered to be a declination of the offer. However, appellant's failure to mitigate her damages by failing to report for duty might toll the agency's future liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shortly after making this pronouncement in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the Commission revisited <span class="Italic">Kalra v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05890555 (1989). The Commission on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Kalra</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Commission, in its previous decision, relied upon the decision in <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Company v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 458 U.S. 219 (1982), in determining that appellant's failure to accept the agency's offer constituted a failure to mitigate which tolled the continuing accrual of backpay liability. Upon review, we find, however, that the facts of the present case make reliance upon the decision in the <span class="Italic">Ford</span> case inappropriate. While in the <span class="Italic">Ford</span> case there had not been a finding of discrimination at the time of the employer's job offer, this <span id="Page_1729"></span>is not true in appellant's case. The lack of an adjudication of liability was a crucial factor in the Supreme Court's determination that when a claimant refuses an unconditional offer of the position oriGINAlly sought, the refusal constitutes a failure to mitigate and the continuing accrual of backpay liability ceases. The inclusion of retroactive seniority was not found appropriate, prior to a finding of liability, since it would put the employer to additional expense and possibly put innocent incumbents at unnecessary risk should no discrimination ultimately be found. Contrarily, in appellant's case, the fact that the agency had discriminated against appellant because of his national origin and age when he was not hired was already adjudicated and established. Therefore, the reasons for limiting the accrual of backpay liability which were persuasive in the <span class="Italic">Ford</span> decision are not present in appellant's case. The issue remains, however, as to whether appellant had the duty to mitigate and/or whether that duty was breached by his failure to accept that agency's offer....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the duty to mitigate damages, under certain circumstances, continues to be applicable and obligatory upon some appellants even after a finding of discrimination has been established. (2)...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The duty to mitigate, after a liability determination, is imposed to avoid egregious results which could occur for example, if an unemployed appellant refused to accept an agency's job offer due to a minor technicality, which could be corrected after the appellant was on duty; meanwhile, the backpay liability would continue to accrue.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission remanded the case for the taking of additional evidence, given its new guidance to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant fails to mitigate damages when the agency unconditionally offers him an equivalent or greater job, provided the offer is not made as part of an effort to resolve the case. <span class="Italic">Bankston v. Secretary of Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01971472 (1998). In such cases, the complainant only is entitled to back pay from the date of nonselection through the date he declined the unconditional job offer.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is not required to mitigate her damages by accepting reinstatement to a position without reasonable accommodation, when the reinstatement order is premised on a failure to make reasonable accommodation. The complainant in <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990007 (1999), requested enforcement of the Commission's order in <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960436 (1998), to offer her reinstatement with the accommodation of a smoke-free environment for her disability of migraines triggered by smoke. The agency did eventually reinstate the complainant to a smoke free environment, but issues of back pay and its mitigation remained unresolved in <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the lack of back pay does not constitute a proper reason for the petitioner to reject the opportunity to mitigate losses by returning to work with the agency, the lack of reasonable accommodation presents a different situation. The petitioner was previously removed for failure to be regular in attendance based on disability related absences that were partly due to workplace tobacco smoke. The duty to mitigate losses did not require her to return to the agency when her disability was not going to be accommodated by reducing or eliminating tobacco smoke and the agency was going to use disability related absences to support further discipline. As the last chance opportunity made abundantly clear, the agency would promptly use future absences to remove the petitioner.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having found the complainant entitled to back pay, the Commission examined the issue of the time period for which the agency was liable in <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the petitioner's duty to mitigate losses did not require her to return to work at the agency in November 1993, she still had a duty to mitigate. The record reflects that after the Commission ordered the agency to offer the petitioner reinstatement with back pay, the agency sent her a questionnaire to elicit information on mitigation efforts. In her September 1998 response, the petitioner wrote that she did not work during the back pay period, but sought employment. She explained that during the first "couple of years" after being removed, she made numerous attempts to gain employment at many local businesses, but each time a prospective employer learned that she had been removed by the agency, the negative reaction was "palpable." She wrote that for the past several years, albeit she did not own a car, she continued to contact local businesses by telephone, but was unsuccessful because being removed resulted in her being labeled as an unfit worker to these prospective employers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency did not ask the petitioner any follow up questions, nor provide any other evidence that she failed in her duty to mitigate losses. Accordingly, the agency failed to meet either prong of its burden to establish that the petitioner failed to mitigate her losses. Hence, the agency's back pay liability runs from December 29, 1992, the effective date of her removal, to August 13, 1998, the date the agency offered the petitioner entrance on duty. Further, the agency must pay interest on back pay it has not already paid the petitioner.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, an employee is not required to accept an alternative offer of employment where the new position would not remove him from the environment where the harassment was occurring. In <span class="Italic">Oest v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110002 (2011), the complainant was a materials handler supervisor for the Bureau of Prisons. He claimed sex discrimination when he was twice denied FMLA leave for the birth of his first and second child. He also alleged harassment by coworkers of a supervisor that he reported for prisoner abuse, including a death threat. In appealing the decision of the administrative judge that he was constructively discharged from his position, the agency argued that he failed to mitigate damages when he declined a job as a supply technician in the Lock Shop under a different supervisor. The Commission rejected that argument and upheld an award of nine years of back pay finding that the job declined by the complainant would still have left him in a position where he would be subject to harassment and retaliation. The Commission also rejected an agency argument that the complainant failed to mitigate damages in his first few years of unemployment because he had no documents to establish that he looked for work. The Commission noted that the administrative judge found the complainant credibly testified about his efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency orders a complainant not to report to work but the complainant remains an agency employee, there is no duty to mitigate damages by seeking other employment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40045 (2005), the Commission found that the agency failed to provide reasonable accommodation for an employee on crutches when it determined he could not be on the workroom floor. On appeal, the agency argued that the complainant failed to mitigate his damages by seeking alternative employment. The Commission further held in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> that the period of back pay did not end on the date the complainant submitted medical documentation to the agency that he was totally disabled from working, but extended up until the date of his reinstatement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To reiterate, the AJ awarded complainant back pay from the day complainant was sent home in November 2000 until the date of his reinstatement. In response, the agency contends on appeal that it should not be compelled to pay back pay since complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability as of April 25, 2001, when he submitted medical documentation indicating he was almost totally disabled. Furthermore, the agency maintains that complainant failed to mitigate his damages because he did not seek employment during the time he was off from work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A back pay claimant under Title VII generally has a duty to mitigate damages. Specifically, &#x00A7; 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g) provides that "interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable." This provision also applies to the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794a. The burden is on the agency, however, to establish that the employee failed in his duty to mitigate. The Commission has generally held that an agency must satisfy a two-prong test to carry its burden of proof; this test requires the agency to show: 1) that complainant failed to use reasonable care and diligence in seeking a suitable position, and 2) that there were suitable positions available which complainant could have discovered and for which he or she was qualified. Where a complainant makes no effort to mitigate damages and does not explain the lack of effort, the agency does not have to meet the second prong. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04930005 (December 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that the proper back pay period should be from November 2000 until January 10, 2002, when the agency offered complainant reassignment to a Data Conversion Operator position. Although complainant testified that he did not seek employment from November 2000 onwards, we note that complainant was technically employed by the agency throughout this period, but denied work by his supervisor. Complainant testified that he was still working for the agency, and had not been dismissed. In light of the fact that he had requested reasonable accommodation during this time, complainant was reasonable in believing that he would be contacted in order to come back to work, and reasonably expected that he would be accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency claims that complainant should not receive back pay after April 26, 2001, the agency's position does not take into consideration what reassignment could have been provided to complainant had the agency properly accommodated him during this time. Accordingly, we decline to limit the agency's liability for the back pay period of April 26, 2001 until January 10, 2002, as complainant should be properly compensated for this period where he was subjected to disability discrimination and retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Truran v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902296 (1990), the Commission also noted that the fact that the employee finds part-time work does not necessarily mean the part-time earnings can be deducted from the back pay award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission notes that the agency in its brief on Appeal states that documentation substantiates appellant's contention that her part-time work was not meant to replace her agency work. The agency thus <span id="Page_1730"></span>concludes that this part-time work therefore did not excuse appellant for seeking further outside employment to replace her lost earnings when she was terminated from her agency position. Yet in her letter of February 28, 1990, to the agency Office of Review, appellant states that the money she earned from her part-time job was deducted from her back pay, an allegation which, if true, would indicate that the agency considered her part-time work as a replacement for her agency work. Hence, this part-time position would have to be considered as substantially equivalent employment to appellant's agency position for purposes of determining whether she made reasonable efforts to find such employment, for otherwise the money earned should not have been deducted as an offset to back pay....</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency also may deduct any earnings made by the employee during the time period covered by the corrective action, provided the employment was engaged in to take the place of federal employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 550.805(e)(2). The agency may not, for example, deduct earnings made as part-time wages from an outside position held by the employee prior to the personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">"The standard for determining whether mitigating earnings should be deducted from a back pay award is whether the supplemental or moonlight job is one that the complainant cannot perform once he is reinstated into the job he lost due to discrimination.... If there is reason to believe he can perform both jobs simultaneously and that he will do so, then those earnings from the supplemental job are independent of the position sought and should be not taken into account in calculating back pay." <span class="Italic">Dang v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996068 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Korchnak v. Postmaster General</span>, 04960028 (1996), the complainant contended that the agency should not be allowed to deduct interim overtime he earned from his back pay award where the position he was denied was part-time. The complainant reasoned that the agency should not benefit from the extra hours he worked where he would not have worked those hours if he had been hired by the agency. The Commission disagreed in <span class="Italic">Korchnak</span>, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's second point of contention regarding the agency's computation of back pay concerns the proper amount of interim earnings the agency should be permitted to deduct. Petitioner contends that the agency only should deduct his interim earnings on an hour-by hour basis; that is, deduct from the hours that he actually worked the hours that he would have worked for the agency. Petitioner noted that he often worked overtime in his interim job whereas he would have been limited to twenty-three hours with the agency as a part-time employee. In support of his position, petitioner cites two cases exempting so-called "moonlighting" earnings from a calculation of interim earning subject to deduction from back pay<span class="Italic">. See Lilly v. City of Beckley</span>, 797 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Behlar v. Smith</span>, 719 F.2d 950, 954 (8th cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 466 U.S. 958 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find these cases inapplicable. Earnings from a second position are not deemed interim earnings subject to deduction from a back pay award where the individual could have held both the supplemental job as well as the job s/he did not have because of the discrimination. Petitioner never makes such an argument herein. Moreover, the Commission rejects petitioner's contention that the monies earned for such extra hours should not be considered. Rather, we find that all sums actually earned during the interim period are considered in reducing the back pay otherwise allowable, unless clearly falling within the limited "moonlighting" exception. For these reasons, we find that the agency properly deducted the sum of petitioner's interim earnings for the period encompassing his discriminatory removal from the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the employee was receiving some form of part-time pay at the time he was removed, it is improper for the agency to deduct such pay from a back pay award after reinstatement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Haines v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974634 (1999), the Commission held that the agency was wrong to deduct reservist pay from a back pay award where the pay would have been received even if the complainant was not removed from his job.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who exhibited previous attendance problems related to his alcoholism may not be deprived of back pay after his reinstatement on the speculative theory that he would have continued to have a high degree of absenteeism. The Commission found that the employee completed the rehabilitation program during the period after his dismissal and remained sober. The agency's argument for eliminating the back pay award was speculative, at best. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902361 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant obtains partial relief through another process, the proper remedy is to off-set any amount of back pay due for discrimination by the amount received through the other forum. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mitchel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953287 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant's back pay award would be off-set by the amount the complainant was paid as part of a grievance settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the agency bears the burden of proof on the mitigation issue, the employee must cooperate and provide the agency with evidence of efforts to secure alternative work. The failure of an agency to notify an employee of his duty to mitigate damages does not excuse the employee from failing to attempt to do so. <span class="Italic">Source v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912228 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who is forced into a leave without pay status as a result of the agency's failure to make reasonable accommodation of her disabling condition is not required to search for alternative employment in order to mitigate her damages. <span class="Italic">See Ferguson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920329 (1992). The Commission found that the employee, in fact, was impeded from finding another job by the agency's action. It found that potential employers would be reluctant to hire her while she remained employed by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee with a disability who receives workers' compensation after his termination is not required to mitigate damages when he testifies that he did not seek alternative employment, because jobs for which he was qualified would not have paid him more than his workers' compensation benefits. In <span class="Italic">Paolozzi v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920423 (1992), the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, appellant argues that he did mitigate the agency's damages because his workers compensation benefits were, in essence, a substitute for wages. The Commission, federal courts, and other federal agencies have held that workers compensation benefits may consist of two components: payments for lost wages and reparation for physical injury suffered. <span class="Italic">Wreford v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890055 (June 29, 1989); <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880848 (May 8, 1990); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Blue and White Service Corp.</span>, 674 F. Supp. 1579, 1582 (D. Minn. 1987); <span class="Italic">American Mfg. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 167 NLRB 520 (1967). Considering appellant's admission that his workers compensation benefits constituted payment for lost wages, his assertion that he would not have been able to find a job which paid more than his workers compensation benefits, and the agency's failure to proffer any evidence that appellant could have found employment during the period in question, we conclude that appellant is entitled to backpay for the two year period from October 1986 through October 1988, offset by the workers compensation attributable to lost wages and any related benefits which he received during this period.</p>
<p class="noindent">On occasion an employee will earn more in his or her subsequent position than he or she would have otherwise earned at the agency, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Vaughn C. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120123332 (2016). By the agency's calculations, the complainant was not due back pay because of the complainant's higher rate of pay while working outside the agency. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Vaughn C</span>., disagreed, holding that where the complainant is unemployed because of the agency's discrimination, the complainant is entitled to back pay for the period of unemployment. This is true even where complainant secures a position at a higher rate of pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of a back pay award is to restore to Petitioner the income he would have otherwise earned but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 442 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975); <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (Nov. 29, 1990). The Agency is required to make certain deductions from back pay awards to ensure that the employee does not receive more in total benefits than he would have received in the absence of the discriminatory personnel action. The person who has been discriminated against must receive a sum of money equal to what would have been earned by that person in the employment lost through discrimination (gross back pay) less what was actually earned from other employment during the period, after normal expenses incurred in seeking and holding the interim employment have been deducted (net interim earnings). The difference between gross back pay and net interim earnings is net back pay due. Gross back pay should include all forms of compensation and must reflect fluctuations in working time, overtime rates, penalty overtime, Sunday premium and night work, changing rate of pay, transfers, promotions, and privileges of employment to which the Petitioner would have been entitled but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Ulloa v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04A30025 (Aug. 3, 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04940006 (May 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Perez v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A40041 (March 3, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that precise measurement cannot always be used to remedy the wrong inflicted, and therefore, the computation of back pay awards inherently involves some speculation. <span class="Italic">Hanns v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04960030 (Sept. 18, 1997). However, uncertainties involved in a back pay determination should be resolved against the Agency which has already been found to have committed the acts of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also Klook v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A40012 (June 16, 2004) <span class="Italic">citing Davis v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EOC Petition No. 04900010 (Nov. 29, 1990); and <span class="Italic">Besemer v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04890005 (Dec. 14, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our prior decision ordered the back pay period in this case to commence on the date Petitioner's resignation (constructive discharge) became effective in May 2011. The record shows that Petitioner was unemployed for about six month following his constructive discharge. After that Petitioner obtained a full-time job with a federal contractor that required him to work in Iraq and Afghanistan. It appears that Petitioner maintained this employment until he was reinstated to his employment with the Agency. The Agency has maintained that, as a result of this employment, Petitioner received higher pay for the total back pay period (from his <span id="Page_1731"></span>constructive discharge to his reinstatement with the Agency) than he would have earned at the Agency absent the discrimination. Therefore, it held that he was entitled to no back pay for the entire period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that it is more correct to examine when the back pay period, which began upon Petitioner's resignation in May 2011, terminated. Courts interpreting Title VII have terminated the back pay period when the complainant has acquired employment which is more lucrative than the job he lost. <span class="Italic">Denton v. Boilermakers Local 29</span>, 673 F. Supp. 37 (D. Mass. 1987) (back pay period ended when income from new employment became more lucrative than earnings employee would have received from prior employment). <span class="Italic">See also, Matthews v. A-1 Inc</span>., 748 F.2d 975, 978 (5th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Nordquist v. Uddeholm Corp</span>., 615 F. Supp. 1191, 1204 (D.C. Conn. 1985); <span class="Italic">DiSalvo v. Chamber of Commerce</span>, 568 F.2d 593, 598 (8th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Butta v. Arundel County</span>, 473 F. Supp. 83 (D. Md. 1979); <span class="Italic">Somers v. Aldine Indep. School</span>, 464 F. Supp. 900, 903 (S.D. Tex. 1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd without op</span>., 620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Milton v. Bell Laboratories. Inc</span>., 428 F. Supp. 502 (D.N.J.1977). Similarly, the Commission has ordered that an individual is not entitled to back pay for any period in which he or she received an amount at least equal to his or her regular pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">Petitioner v. Department of the Air Force (National Guard Bureau)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110023 (July 2, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these principles to determine when Petitioner's back pay period ended, we find that the Agency incorrectly found that Petitioner was not entitled to any back pay at all. Instead, Petitioner should be awarded back pay from the date of his resignation (constructive discharge) until he started earning more than he would have earned if he had continued to be employed by the Agency. We will order the Agency to recalculate his entitlement to back pay based on this guidance. In making this new calculation, the Agency must also consider any salary increases, including all step increases, promotions and other bonuses, that Petitioner would have been entitled to during the back pay period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, as part of back pay, Petitioner is not just entitled to his monetary salary, but also to the "benefits" he would have earned but for the discrimination, which might include annual leave, sick leave, health insurance, overtime and premium pay, night differentials and retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">See Vereb v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04980008 (Feb. 29, 1999). There is no evidence in the record that the Agency calculated what it might owe Petitioner with regard to these benefits. For example, there is no indication that the Agency has restored Petitioner's annual and sick leave balances or made appropriate contributions to his retirement benefits and/or "catch-up" contributions to his Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further remind the Agency that the Commission has held that, under both legal and equitable theories, an award to cover additional tax liability from a lump sum payment of back pay is available to complainants <span class="Italic">Van Hoose v. Dep't. of Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982628 and 01990455 (Aug. 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Goetze v. Dep't. of Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (Aug. 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Holler v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982627 and 01990407 (Aug. 22, 2001). In the event Petitioner incurs any tax liability due to a lump sum payment of back pay/benefits, the Agency is directed to comply with the aforementioned long-standing Commission precedents in accordance with the Order below.</p>
