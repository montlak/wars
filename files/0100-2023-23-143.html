<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-141"><span class="space">4.</span> Clearance to Return to Work</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not make a disability-related medical inquiry unless it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. This restriction applies regardless of whether the complainant is an individual with a disability. Moreover, the agency's intent in such cases is not relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency requires an employee to provide a medical clearance prior to returning to work, it must demonstrate that it has a reasonable belief that the employee's ability to perform essential job functions was impaired or that the employee poses a threat to himself or someone else. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Fratini v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04801 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the FAD failed to analyze complainant's claim that he <span id="Page_1241"></span>was improperly ordered to provide medical clearance prior to resuming work as a possible violation of the Rehabilitation Act, which, like claims regarding denial of reasonable accommodation, does not require any showing of discriminatory intent. An employer may not make disability-related inquiries unless it is job-related and consistent with business necessity<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1630.14(c); <span class="Italic">see</span> also EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span> (July 27, 2000) at "General Principles" B &#x0026; n.3 (noting application of ADA standard to Rehabilitation Act claims). Moreover, a complainant need not establish that he is an individual with a disability in order to raise such a claim under the Rehabilitation Act. The provisions regarding when an employer may require a medical examination apply to all employees, not solely to individuals with disabilities as defined under the Rehabilitation Act<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this standard, if an employer has a reasonable belief that an employee's present ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition or that he will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition, the employer may make disability-related inquiries. Any inquiries, however, must be limited in scope to what is needed to make an assessment of the employee's ability to work. Usually, inquiries related to the specific medical condition for which the employee took leave will be all that is warranted<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at question 17. In the instant case, the record indicates that complainant suffered from chronic anxiety disorder with occasional panic attacks and some depression. In light of those medical reasons, complainant was absent from work from January 15 through February 22, 1998.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency had a reasonable belief, based on the record evidence, that complainant's ability to perform his essential job functions were impaired. Consequently, the agency's request for medical clearance from complainant's treating physician was not improper. We further find that the agency sent complainant home because he had not complied with the agency's policy of having medical clearance prior to returning to work after an extended medical leave. The record evidence provides that complainant's supervisor sent him a letter explaining that medical clearance would be necessary when he returned to work. Consequently, although complainant was initially sent home, he was permitted to return to work the day after he received the necessary medical clearance from his medical doctor. Furthermore, complainant did not rebut the agency's articulated reason. He produced no additional evidence to show that the agency's proffered reason for sending him home was pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are actually two requirements for making a medical inquiry prior to clearance for return to work. The agency must demonstrate that it has a reasonable belief that the employee cannot perform an essential job function or is a direct threat, and that belief must be based on "objective evidence." Further, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that the criteria are met. For example, in <span class="Italic">Triplett-Graham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A44720 (2006), the agency demonstrated both criteria existed where the complainant had been off from work for over two years, and she stated that she didn't know if she had any restrictions and that her doctor had told her to work at her own pace and report to him if she experienced any pain.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency has a reasonable belief based on objective evidence where the complainant is a nurse in a surgical unit and her condition is infectious. In <span class="Italic">Norton v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A51018 (2006), the complainant was out of work due to cellulites. Her physician originally sent the agency a note indicating that the complainant might have some level of infection. Even though her physician sent a later note indicating that the complainant was healing without complications and did not pose a risk of infection, the Commission found that the agency was justified in seeking a further explanation from the physician.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122855 (2013), the Commission found that the agency did not violate the ADA where his psychologist cleared him to return to duty after an 11-month absence, but the complainant's wife wrote to the agency indicating that her husband was "mentally unstable." The agency then asked the complainant to have his psychologist respond to the wife's letter with specific information. In finding that the agency's request was job-related and consistent with business necessity, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist originally cleared Complainant to return to work with no restrictions. The note provided no explanation why, after an eleven months absence, Complainant was now healthy enough to return. Complainant's immediate supervisors failed to follow proper procedure and have him cleared through the medical unit. Then, based on W's letter attesting to Complainant's mental instability, which Complainant himself sent, management sought additional affirmation from Complainant's treating psychologist that he was able to return to work. Complainant refused to cooperate with management's request. We find that the decision not to permit Complainant to return work and the request for additional medical documentation were reasonable, job-related, and consistent with business necessity and therefore not in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120121517 (2015), the Commission found a medical examination for clearance to return to duty was warranted where, as the result of an accident, the complainant was absent for an extended period of time and the complainant had also made statements indicating an incestual relationship with his daughter:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as discussed above, the record reveals that management sent Complainant for the FFDE based on multiple reasons. First, S2 affirmed that Agency policy required Complainant to be cleared by the Agency's Employee Health Physician before returning to work because he had been out an extended period of time. In addition, S2 stated that Agency management had concerns about the circumstances surrounding Complainant's accident and his explanation of the accident. Further, S2 was concerned about a series of "very bizarre and incriminating" statements Complainant made sometime prior to his accident that he had been accused of child molestation, that he was accused of passing a sexually-transmitted disease to his own child, that he had been questioned by his wife regarding an incestuous affair with his daughter, and other statements related to oral sex and his daughter. S2 noted that Complainant repeated these statements over the course of several months. Thus, based on the totality of this evidence, management sent Complainant for an FFDE, which subsequently found that he was unfit for duty as a police officer. The Commission finds that there was nothing unlawful about the FFDE as the Agency has established that S2 ordered the FFDE based upon objective evidence that Complainant may have been unfit to carry a weapon and therefore unable to perform the essential functions of his job.</p>
<p class="noindent">As an alternative to showing that it has a reasonable belief that the employee's present ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired, an agency may also show it has a reasonable belief the employee poses a direct threat. <span class="Italic">Courtney v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981316 (2001). See Chapter 15 under the heading "'<a href="0100-2023-24-022.html#sec15-23">Direct Threat' of 'Elevated Risk' Standard</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant provides medical documentation that he is unable to work due to a medical condition and placed on leave, it is job-related and consistent with business necessity for an agency to request medical documentation that the complainant is cleared to return to duties. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120132485 (2015), the Commission found that the agency was justified in ordering a fitness-for-duty examination after the complainant returned to work and his coworkers reported strange behavior:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find the medical documentation requested was job related and consistent with business necessity. Until the Agency received the August 2011 documentation, it was not clear that Complainant was authorized to return to work. From July-early August, the medical documentation submitted by Complainant was vague and in some cases, begged further questions. For example, the documentation dated on or about August 5, 2011 states that Complainant could return to work activities, but his symptoms would prevent him from completing his duties on occasion. Furthermore, she wrote, "being able to return to work will allow us to see how he is progressing with his medications and counseling sessions." However, once Complainant's physician submitted the medical documentation requested, Complainant was approved to return to work at the end of August 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although it does appear that this process could have been more efficient, and was likely delayed a few weeks due to communication issues, we find insufficient evidence that the Agency delayed this process intentionally, or asked for an unreasonable amount of clarity. Had Complainant requested a hearing in this matter, management's motive could have been explored more, but Complainant specifically requested a Final Agency Decision in this matter, so we are left to access management's credibility based on the existing record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 6, 2011, Complainant returned to work for approximately one hour, when it became clear he could not physically perform his work duties due to a new impairment. He requested a reasonable accommodation, and again, the Agency reasonably requested documentation supporting his return to work. <span class="Italic">See</span> Enforcement Guidance at Question 6 (October 17, 2002) ("When the disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious, the employer may ask the individual for reasonable documentation about his/her disability and functional limitations. The employer is entitled to know that the individual has a covered disability for which s/he needs a reasonable accommodation...Reasonable documentation means that the employer may require only the documentation that is needed to establish that a person has an ADA disability, and that the disability necessitates a reasonable accommodation.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, the Agency and Complainant began back and forth communications which were less than ideal. In some instances, Complainant submitted conflicting medical evidence which reasonably caused the Agency to consider whether Complainant was able to perform the essential functions of his job. For example, Complainant's neurologist submitted a note dated October 20, 2011 which stated that Complainant <span id="Page_1242"></span>was recovering and could return to some work, but that Complainant was also advised about short term disability given the uncertainly of the course of his illness. Once Complainant submitted an accommodation request with supporting medical documentation regarding his specific limitations, he was brought back to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a few months, however, the Agency received complaints from co-workers regarding Complainant's behavior, and placed him on administrative leave and requested a fitness for duty examination. Complainant asserts this was done because of his disability and in retaliation for having requested an accommodation. One co-worker stated she overheard Complainant having conversations with himself; yelled at people who were not even in the work; and seemed more agitated than usual. Another stated that Complainant vacillated between politeness and outright hostility, used obscenities, and became belligerent and challenging. Other employees stated that Complainant walked around the office without shoes on, and removed his dentures while speaking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Agency placed Complainant on administrative leave and required him to submit medical documentation for a fitness for duty examination because it had a reasonable belief, based on the best available objective evidence, that he was unable to perform the essential functions of his job or that he could pose a direct threat. Following the FFDE, Complainant was deemed unfit for work and applied for disability retirement. Complainant did not prove, more likely than not, that the Agency's reason for placing him on administrative leave was a pretext for discrimination. Furthermore, after a review of the record, we find that the Agency's requested medical documentation was job-related and consistent with business necessity, and did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant cannot avoid a legitimate medical inquiry simply by asserting that provision of medical documents would interfere with therapy. In a case that arose under a settlement agreement, the Commission held that the complainant had breached the agreement by not providing the records because he had never explained in what way disclosure of the records would interfere with his therapy. In <span class="Italic">Wilks v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21276 (2002), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determines that provision 1 obligates complainant to do more than merely present himself to the examining physician, but further requires that he cooperate in the examination process. Due to the nature of his mental/physical impairment, this necessarily includes submission of current medical records reflecting whether complainant has been compliant with his treatment and abstinent from alcohol. Additionally, we find that the August 29, 2000 physician statement fails to explain how complainant's therapy would be compromised by disclosure of these records, given that disclosure is solely for the purpose of determining whether complainant may safely resume his former position, or if not, for the purpose of determining an appropriate reasonable accommodation. Moreover, we find that complainant fails to indicate that he shares this concern about the effect of disclosure on his therapy, and otherwise provides no reason for not authorizing release of these records. Therefore, we find that any noncompliance regarding provisions 1 and 2 are due to acts attributable to complainant, and we find no breach of either provision by the agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.504 (c).</p>
<p class="noindent">If continued treatment is a condition of employment then the employee must provide proof of that treatment prior to returning to work. In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120071409 (2009), the complainant was placed in an off-duty, off-pay status after receiving a report from a psychiatrist that he could return to work only if he participated in psychotherapy. The complainant signed a "return to work" agreement that required him to attend weekly sessions. The Commission found that in the absence of sufficient medical documentation to demonstrate he was adhering to that requirement that the agency was justified in not permitting him to return to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency's need for additional medical information is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the Commission has no jurisdiction over an allegation that the agency has contacted his physician without his permission. In <span class="Italic">Cimo v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A52441 (2005), an agency nurse contacted the complainant's physician after he was released from the hospital following a suicide attempt to determine if was fit to return to work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cimo</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ correctly stated that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when the agency nurse contacted complainant's physician without complainant's consent. Again, an employer may make disability-related inquiries that are job-related and consistent with a business necessity. As stated above, the agency was entitled to make a disability-related inquiry because of its objective belief that complainant posed a direct threat. It is true that the agency contacted the doctor without complainant's consent. However, whether an agency may contact an employee's physician without his or her permission is outside the purview of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Jaskot v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01996450 (June 19, 2002) ("[F]ailure of an agency to obtain a release prior to making an otherwise permissible disability-related inquiry does not violate the Rehabilitation Act").</p>
<p class="noindent">Short delays in evaluating an employee's medical clearance for return to work do not violate the Rehabilitation Act. For example, in <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120062895 (2007), the Commission found that an employee with epilepsy who had seizures at work and was injured was not subject to discrimination where the agency rejected the first medical clearance as not containing sufficient information and took eight days to decide on the second medical clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the medical documentation is required by an agency handbook or policy manual does not provide a defense to a claim of an improper inquiry under the ADA. In <span class="Italic">Bernal v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080038 (2008), the Commission found that the complainant's supervisors were following the agency's Employee Labor Manual and standard operating procedure when they requested more detailed medical information after the employee presented a note from his physician for a one-day absence indicating that, among other things, he had been seen for depression. Noting that the agency had already amended the ELM provision to require medical evidence only when job-related and consistent with business necessity, the Commission nonetheless upheld the finding of its administrative judge that the inquiry violated the ADA because the supervisors admitted they did not believe the depression interfered with the complainant's performance.</p>
