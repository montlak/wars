<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-107"><span id="Page_1062"></span><span class="space">9.</span> Personal Effects</h4>
<p class="noindent">Employees often are permitted to keep personal effects in their work area. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with this practice and, often, family pictures and other memorabilia give the workplace a personal touch and can lead to increased pride in the appearance of the employee's work space. A problem can arise where those personal effects include items of religious significance. A supervisor does not engage in religious discrimination by ordering an employee to remove a Bible from his desk where the directive is to remove the "clutter" from the work area, is not directed exclusively to the Bible and includes other personal books and papers. <span class="Italic">Harpe v. Department of Navy</span>, 01851383 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Juhl v. Attorney General</span>, 01944685 (1996), the Commission addressed the issue of whether allowing the complainant to keep religious articles in her office would create an undue hardship. In that case, the complainant had several religious objects in her workspace, including a Bible, religious pamphlets and a painting of Jesus. The complaint arose when she was ordered to remove the objects. Finding that both the administrative judge and the complainant failed to understand the proper analysis to apply in <span class="Italic">Juhl</span>, the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first issue concerns whether appellant was discriminated against on the basis of her religious beliefs and retaliated against for her activities as an EEO counselor when she was told to remove religious articles from her office. The AJ found that appellant was not discriminated against because she offered no comparative evidence that a similarly-situated employee outside her protected group was treated more favorably. The AJ also found that even if employees who were not instructed to remove religious materials were outside appellant's protected group, appellant presented no evidence that they were similarly situated. Appellant contends that the AJ erred in not applying a mixed-motive analysis to this case, as required by <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). Appellant argues that because there is direct evidence of discriminatory motive, the three-step test set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the AJ and appellant misapprehend the pertinent inquiry. Instead of a disparate treatment analysis, a religious accommodation analysis is appropriate to this case. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers may be liable for failure to accommodate the religious practices of their employees, absent proof that such accommodation could not be made without imposing an undue hardship on the employer. 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(j); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.2(b)(1). In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on the failure to accommodate, the complainant must demonstrate that: (1) she has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement; (2) she informed her employer of this religious belief; and (3) she was disciplined for failure to comply with the conflicting employment requirement or otherwise adversely affected<span class="Italic">. Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.</span>, 736 F.2d 1022, 1026 (5th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Reilly v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941810 (November 17, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an employee has been required to remove religious articles from his or her work space, the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case are normally apparent. The employer has "enough information about an employee's religious beliefs to permit the employer to understand the existence of a conflict between the employee's religious practices and the employer's job requirements." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Polk County</span>, 68 FEP 648 (8th Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate that it cannot reasonably accommodate appellant's religious beliefs without incurring an undue hardship upon its operations. 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(j); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.2(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Pyro Mining Co.</span>, 827 F.2d 1081, 1085 (6th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Alvarea v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921341 (June 4, 1993). Undue hardship has been construed as anything more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost to the employer<span class="Italic">. Trans World Airlines Inc. v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 84 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of failure to accommodate her religious beliefs, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate that it cannot permit appellant to keep religious articles at her work station or to allow her to try to convert inmates whom she counsels. The agency's evidence with regard to the order to remove religious articles has focused on a complaint that RO 1 received from an inmate regarding the number of religious articles in appellant's office and apparent attempts by appellant to convert inmates; the inmate who complained also indicated that other inmates had similar concerns. RO 1 asked the Associate Warden to look into the situation and have appellant "tone down" the number of religious articles if it was in excess. RO 2 was then instructed to have appellant remove some of the materials to ensure a professional atmosphere. RO 2 testified that the number of religious articles gave the appearance of interfering with appellant's duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are uncertain that allowing appellant to keep religious material in her office would create an undue hardship. It will generally be difficult for an employer to establish that permitting an employee to keep a Bible on his or her desk, or other expressions of his or her religious beliefs in a private work station, would create an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Polk County</span>, 68 FEP 648 (order to remove religious articles described as "extraordinary").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, where the employee counsels clients, a display of religious articles might create an undue hardship where the display could reasonably be perceived as agency endorsement of a particular religion<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Spratt v. County of Kent</span>, 621 F. Supp. 594, 600 (W.D. Mich. 1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 810 F.2d 203 (6th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 480 U.S. 934 (1987) (sheriff had limited flexibility with regard to accommodation of social worker's religion, where social worker used his religion in his psychological counseling of jail inmates, because of sheriff's obligation under the establishment clause to maintain policy of neutrality on religious matters).</p>
<p class="noindent">The evidence was unclear whether the display might reasonably be perceived as agency endorsement of religion. Similarly, the evidence was unclear whether the agency could show that attempts to convert could interfere with complainant's counseling duties. The Commission remanded the case for the agency to investigate whether the complainant actually was attempting to use religion in counseling the inmates. On remand, the agency was further required to determine what the complainant was doing, whether it infringed on the inmates that she was responsible for counseling, and whether it interfered with the agency's philosophy of counseling. Moreover, the Commission noted, even if the complainant was inappropriately using religious counseling, it was not clear whether agency officials ever asked her to stop this practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A61291 (2006), the Commission found that the agency had not failed to accommodate the complainant's religious beliefs in ordering him to remove religious objects displayed in areas beyond his private workspace. In finding that there was no failure to accommodate, the Commission noted that the agency also ordered the removal of nonreligious objects that it considered inappropriate from public areas. It further noted that, contributing to the possible perception that the agency was endorsing a religion through his displays, was the complainant's aggressive attitude in sharing his religious views with coworkers. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Boyd</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record amply supports the agency's reasons for its actions. Further, to the extent that complainant raised a claim of harassment, we find that the alleged actions do not rise to the level of a hostile work environment and that complainant failed to show that the alleged actions were based on discriminatory motives. Specifically, regarding the incident alleged in (d), assuming that complainant showed that he had a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicted with his employment, i.e., witnessing to others through religious statements and displays, the agency showed that it accommodated complainant and that, to do more, would cause it an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. 1605.2(c); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10112 (June 27, 2002). Here, the investigative file reveals that the agency gave complainant written information regarding the appropriate exercise and expression of religion in the Federal workplace and suggested that he remove some items from areas that were in public view or exceeded his work space. Essentially, the agency asked complainant to remove items from areas that may give the impression that the agency endorsed the views expressed by the items. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Juhl v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983150 (September 28, 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Polk County</span>, 61 F.3d 650 (1995)). We note that the items included more than religious possessions, e.g., the picture of a woman in a suggestive pose and the FAA tee shirt with a government seal. The agency showed that allowing complainant to display a significant amount of religious items in public view or beyond his work space, coupled with his aggressive and judgmental manner of sharing his religious beliefs to coworkers and clients, could constitute the agency's endorsement of a particular religion or otherwise render an undue hardship on the agency.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> For instance, the nature of the agency's business was based on "policing" and complainant interfered with the manner in which the agency conducted its business.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Accordingly, we find that the agency did not deny complainant a reasonable accommodation as he alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Lin v. Agency for International Development</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120064322.txt">0120064322</a> (2006), the Commission found that the hanging of a crucifix in the acting director's office of the Center for Faith--Based and Community Initiatives did not create a hostile work environment for a Jewish employee. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lin</span>, agreed with the agency's findings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding allegation 1 of the religious harassment claim, the agency stated that the alleged discriminatory conduct was not so severe or pervasive so as to have created a hostile work environment abusive to employees or unreasonably interfering with complainant's work performance. The agency noted that complainant did not complain about the display of the crucifix until he wrote a letter, dated October 18, 2004, to the agency's Office of General Counsel (OGC). The agency further noted that the space occupied by the crucifix was the Director's personal office space which was by necessity used for meetings with staff and other persons needing to meet in the Center. The agency also noted that the crucifix was not displayed in a conference room. The agency <span id="Page_1063"></span>further stated in its decision that because the Acting Director did not discuss religion, she did not know that complainant was Jewish until she was told in August 2004. The agency also noted that the Acting Director had sought the advice of the OGC before placing the crucifix on her office wall.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's Compliance Manual, Section 12-IV, C, 6, b, addresses the parameters for determining if a religious display in the workplace could be an undue hardship based on interactions with customers or clients:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether it is an undue hardship to allow employees to engage in religiously oriented expression toward customers is a fact-specific inquiry and will depend on the nature of the expression, the nature of the employer's business, and the extent of the impact on customer relations. For example, one court found that it was a reasonable accommodation to allow an employee to use the general religious greeting "Have a Blessed Day" with coworkers and with customers who had not objected, rather than using it with everyone, including a customer who objected. However, other courts have found undue hardship where religiously oriented expression was used in the context of a regular business interaction with a client. Whether or not the client objects, religiously oriented expression may create an undue hardship for an employer where the expression could be mistaken as the employer's message, particularly in the instance of government employers. Where the religiously oriented expression is not limited to use of a phrase or greeting, but rather is in the manner of individualized, specific proselytizing, an employer is far more likely to be able to demonstrate that it would constitute an undue hardship to accommodate an employee's religious expression, regardless of the length or nature of the business interaction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 50--Display of Religious Objects by an Employee</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Susan and Roger are members of the same church and are both employed at XYZ Corporation. Susan works as an architect in a private office on an upper floor, where she occasionally interacts with coworkers, but not with clients. Roger is a security guard stationed at a desk in the front lobby of the XYZ building through which all employees, clients, and other visitors must enter. At a recent service at Susan and Roger's church, the minister distributed posters with the message "Jesus Saves!" and encouraged parishioners to display the posters at their workplaces in order to "spread the word." Susan and Roger each display the poster on the wall above their respective workstations. XYZ orders both to remove the poster despite the fact that both explained that they felt a religious obligation to display it, and despite the fact that there have been no complaints from coworkers or clients.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Susan and Roger file charges alleging denial of religious accommodation. The employer will probably be unable to show that allowing Susan to display a religious message in her personal workspace posed an undue hardship, unless there was evidence of disruption to the business or the workplace which resulted. By contrast, because Roger sits at the lobby desk and the poster is the first thing that visitors see upon entering the building, it would appear to represent XYZ's views and would therefore likely be shown to pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 51--Undue Hardship to Allow Employee to Discuss Religion with Clients</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Helen, an employee in a mental health facility that served a religiously and ethnically diverse clientele, frequently spoke with clients about religious issues and shared religious tracts with them as a way to help solve their problems, despite being instructed not to do so. After clients complained, Helen's employer issued her a letter of reprimand stating that she should not promote her religious beliefs to clients and that she would be terminated if she persisted. Helen's belief in the need to evangelize to clients cannot be accommodated without undue hardship. The employer has the right to control speech that threatens to impede provision of effective and efficient services. Clients, especially in a mental health setting, may not understand that the religious message represents Helen's beliefs rather than the facility's view of the most beneficial treatment for the patient.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Inman v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064352 (2006), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim for relief where the complainant maintained that the agency had made her erase religious statements from a board at her work station and the postmaster ordered the removal of all religious materials. The Commission found the complainant stated a claim for denial of religious accommodation that needed further factual development.</p>
