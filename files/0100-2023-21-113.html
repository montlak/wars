<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-84"><span class="space">2.</span> Agency's Duty to Investigate</h4>
<p class="noindent">Once an agency has actual or constructive knowledge of allegedly harassing, it has a duty to promptly investigate the conduct. That duty to investigate the alleged conduct should not be confused with an EEO investigation that occurs after a complaint has been filed. The duty to investigate the alleged conduct arises at the time of the agency's knowledge of potentially harassing conduct. The investigation must be both prompt and impartial. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Notice No. N-915-050, Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (March 19, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The case of <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070020 (2010), demonstrates precisely what the agency should not do when it receives a complainant of harassment, as well as the downside of the oft-played "blame the victim" defense. In <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, the complainant and a coworker had a consensual relationship for a few years. That relationship ended and the complainant subsequently married someone else. The complainant was then awarded a bid position that brought him back in proximity of the coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent">The coworker, having learned of the complainant's marriage, started asking the complainant to go on dates. After he refused, she told him "Fuck you and go to hell." The complainant was then regularly subjected to obscenities and comments about his sexual prowess with the coworker telling him things like, "you not shit" and "eat my pussy." She also told coworkers that the complainant had a "little penis" and that she did not want him anyway. The comments, according to the complainant, ranged from twice a week to daily and he was repeatedly subjected to her comments because she was a union steward who could freely move about the plant regardless of the machine the complainant worked on.</p>
<p class="noindent">In December 2002, the complainant brought the coworker's behavior to the attention of his supervisor, who responded, among other things, by telling the complainant "Oh, I wish I had those problems." The complainant against brought the coworker's behavior to the attention of his supervisor in January 2003 and was told, "Hey, you need to just knock this shit off and just give it up." Finally, in April 2003, the coworker told the complainant to "eat my pussy" and grabbed her crotch. The complainant told her to "Leave me alone, bitch." This time his complaint to his supervisor contacted Labor Relations. The complainant was not interviewed in the ensuing investigation that resulted in both him and the coworker receiving letters of warning for conduct unbecoming.</p>
<p class="noindent">The coworker was also moved to another building but returned a couple of weeks later. The agency turned down a request by the complainant to work a different shift so he would not have to encounter the coworker. Finally, the agency transferred the complainant to another building over his objection.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had little difficulty affirming the findings of its administrative judge on the existence of a hostile environment. It also found liability rejecting agency arguments that the initial complaints were trivial and did not rise to the level of a hostile environment. As the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the complainant must establish that the agency knew or should have known of the harassment. This addresses the issue of whether the agency should be held liable for the existence of a hostile working environment. Where, as here, the alleged harassment is perpetrated by a co-worker, liability is imputed to the employer if it knew or should have known of the misconduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 at 29-30 (March 19, 1990); <span class="Italic">Owens v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940824 (September 5, 1996). What is appropriate action will necessarily depend on the facts of the particular case, the severity and persistence of the harassment, and the effectiveness of any initial remedial step. <span class="Italic">Owens, supra</span>. The employer should make follow-up inquiries to make certain that the harassment has not resumed and the victim has not suffered retaliation. EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 at 30 (March 19, 1990). Here, the record clearly establishes that complainant reported the ongoing sexual harassment to management and nothing was done until the April 9, 2003 incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the agency's argument that the earlier complaints were trivial and did not rise to the level of harassment to be wholly without merit. We further find that the AJ correctly characterized this case as a classic instance of blaming the victim. The Commission notes <span id="Page_907"></span>that, on appeal, the agency argues that complainant often flirted and teased. The agency also mentions that witnesses indicated that they did not witness the sexual harassment that complainant complained about. However we find the agency completely overlooks the substantial evidence that its supervisor was aware of complainant's allegations of sexual harassment. Further, agency management indicated that it decided to remove complainant from his work location because of the April 9, 2003 incident. The Commission has long held that in instances of sexual harassment the victim is not the person who should undergo any punishment or inconvenience to correct the harassment; such actions against a victim reek of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency has not presented any evidence which indicates that the AJ's decision finding of discrimination was in error. In fact, the agency spends a substantial amount of its time defending the agency's investigative summary of the April 9, 2003 incident. The agency appears to be shocked that its investigative process and findings were criticized. However, based on our review of the record, these criticisms were fairly and deservedly made. Further, with respect to the agency's complaints regarding the cross-examination of its management officials and leading questions by complainant's attorney, the Commission notes that the agency was represented by counsel at the hearing. Any objections the agency may have had in the course of the hearing should have been raised with the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, as discussed more fully below, conducting a prompt investigation does not absolve the agency of liability when it fails to take prompt corrective action after confirming the alleged conduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Trey M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120180781 (2019) (conducting inquiries into the alleged harassing behavior and referring the alleged harasser to EAP did not qualify as appropriate corrective action); <span class="Italic">Danita S. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120161096 (2018) (the agency failed to take appropriate corrective action where it launched an investigation shortly after management was made aware of the harassment and issued the alleged harasser a letter of reprimand, but left the harasser to work with the complainant during the investigation, which led to the complainant asking for a transfer); <span class="Italic">Schmid v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101575 (2012) (no defense to liability where agency initiated investigation within five days of the allegations but failed to take any corrective action for four months).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rockymore v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110311 (2012), the Commission found that the agency's investigation was not prompt where it delayed several weeks in responding to a complaint that include a coworker kissing and hugging the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record clearly established that Complainant reported the sexual harassment to the Acting Supervisor and the Acting Manager on November 4, 2008. However, the Acting Manager waited one week before discussing the matter with the parties involved. The Acting Manager stated that she conducted an investigation. However, we find no evidence in the record to explain the extent of any purported investigation. The only notes provided by the Acting Manager showed that she spoke to Complainant on November 16, 2008, and then, on November 18, 2008, to the Co-worker. The Acting Manager then brought the Complainant into her meeting with the Co-worker so that the Co-worker could apologize. The Acting Manager then told Complainant that it was her word against his and that nothing could be done. The Acting Manager stated that she could not issue disciplinary action against the Co-worker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, one month later, the Senior Manager and Plant Manager responded to Complainant's complaint of sexual harassment by bringing the parties together and discussing the incidents. Again, we find a month delay by management fails to meet the requirement of a prompt investigation. Further, we note that the Managers did not conduct an investigation, but seemed to have questioned the individuals together about the alleged harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that its management officials responded appropriately to Complainant's complaints of sexual harassment. The Agency indicated that the Acting Manager conducted an investigation and responded to the complaints. Further, the Agency showed that, in December 2008, the Plant Manager and the Senior Manager met with Complainant and the Co-worker about the alleged harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find no justification for the Acting Manager's two week delay in responding to Complainant's complaint of harassment particularly in light of the fact that Complainant indicated that the Co-Worker physically touched her. We find that such a delay in responding to Complainant's complaint showed that the Agency failed to take prompt corrective action. Further, we again note that beyond the Acting Manager's assertion that she conducted an investigation, there was little evidence to show that the purported investigation was sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we cannot find that the Acting Manager's action constituted prompt action. <span class="Italic">See Coley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120062109 (Apr. 11, 2008) (finding that a two week delay in responding to an employee's claim of harassment was not appropriate); <span class="Italic">see also Guess v. Bethlehem Steel Corp</span>., 913 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1990), (stating that "The employer acts unreasonably either if it delays unduly or if the action it does take, however promptly, is not reasonably Likely to prevent the misconduct from recurring."); <span class="Italic">Bacon v. Art Inst. of Chicago</span>, 6 F. Supp.2d 762, 767 (N.D. Ill. 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, any inquiry by the Plant Manager and the Senior Manager in December 2008, a month after Complainant alleged harassment, was similarly not considered to constitute immediate and appropriate corrective action. The Plant Manager indicated that Complainant did not push management on the claim of harassment in their meetings in December 2008. However, we find such a statement by the management officials to be unpersuasive. We note that in November when Complainant raised the harassment complaint, she was told by the Acting Manager that nothing could be done. Further, the Plant Manager and the Senior Manager did not come to speak to Complainant until over a month after she raised her complaints. It is reasonable for Complainant not to be aggressive regarding her claim of harassment by December 2008, particularly in light of the information Complainant was provided by the Acting Manager and the delay in responding to her complaints by all of the management officials. Based on our review of the record, we find that Complainant was subjected to sexual harassment at the hands of the Co-worker and that the Agency's management officials failed to take prompt corrective action. Therefore, the Agency is liable for the hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060003 (2007), the Commission rejected an agency argument that an OIG investigation into allegations of sexual harassment should exempt it from liability, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the agency's arguments wholly unpersuasive, and our case law on this matter is clear. When an employer becomes aware of alleged harassment, it has the duty to investigate the charges promptly and thoroughly. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953850 (Aug. 29, 1996). By "thoroughly" the Commission means "effectively," taking whatever action necessary to end the harassment and prevent the misconduct from recurring. <span class="Italic">See Voigt v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931799 (Dec. 20, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record clearly reflects, and the agency acknowledges in its brief on appeal, that the OIG was contacted regarding complainant's allegations in May 2003, but the investigation finding sexual harassment was not completed until November 2003. Further, we concur with the AJ's finding that not only was the agency's investigation far from prompt, no appropriate corrective action was undertaken in the interim to end the harassment and prevent its recurrence. As evidence of this, we note that in June 2003, after the agency was put on notice and the OIG began its investigation, complainant was awarded a temporary restraining order (TRO) against S1 by the California Superior Court, despite agency officials appearing at the TRO proceedings in support of S1. Based on the evidence of record, we concur with the AJ's findings that the agency failed to reasonably and timely identify and investigate complainant's complaint of sexual harassment, and the agency is, therefore, liable for this harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120130331 (2015), the Commission found that a two-week delay by the supervisor in questioning the alleged harasser was sufficient to establish liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the record does establish that once the Agency learned of the harassment, it failed to take prompt and effective action to address the harassment. The record gives conflicting dates for when S1 finally began to address the sexual harassment; Complainant stated that S1 talked to her on September 10 or 11, 2010, while in contrast S1 stated that he spoke to Complainant on September 15, 2010. We will give S1 the benefit of the doubt and assume that he spoke to Complainant on September 10, 2010, which is 11 days after he learned about the harassment. The Agency has offered no justification for why it took S1 11 days to speak to Complainant, or why during those 11 days he never spoke to CW2 or took any other steps to address the allegations of sexual harassment. In fact, the record establishes that S1 did not speak to CW2 about the harassment until September 20, 2012, which is 21 days after S1 learned about the allegations of sexual harassment. We find that a 21 day delay in speaking with an alleged sexual harasser constitutes a failure to act promptly to address harassment. <span class="Italic">See Rockymore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110311 (Jan. 31, 2012) (The Commission found a two week delay in responding to notification of harassment that included an allegation of physical touching showed that the Agency failed to take prompt corrective action).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Between the date that S1 spoke with Complainant about the harassment and the date that he finally spoke with CW2 about the harassment, CW2 continued to harass both Complainant and CW4. The record shows that on September 17, 2010, CW2 heard Complainant say that she was hungry and he made a reference to oral sex when he told her, "I want to eat something too, but you won't let me." Additionally, Complainant stated that on September 18, 2010, while she was in the warehouse CW2 made a comment about her backing her buttocks up to him. Complainant's allegations of the continued harassment are supported by a statement <span id="Page_908"></span>from CW4, who said that CW2 harassed her on September 17, 2010. The harassment would not have continued if S1 promptly and effectively addressed the harassment when he learned of it on August 30, 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that S1 did not act promptly or effectively when he did not separate Complainant and CW2 immediately after he learned of the allegations of sexual harassment. The record shows that Complainant told S1 on a few occasions that she wanted to be separated from CW2, however CW2 continued to be present in her workplace. ROI at 50. Complainant stated that she was told that they could not be separated because CW2 was a federal employee and it was his workplace too, and they could not prevent him from coming through her cashier lane. This is inaccurate, as every measure should be taken to ensure that parties are separated when allegations of sexual harassment involving physically touching are made. Further, the record indicates that when the parties finally were separated, Complainant was forced to change her shift against her will, while CW2 was allowed to keep his shift. ROI at 17. While Complainant did not raise this as a claim in her formal complaint, we want to make sure the Agency is aware that this could have stated a claim of reprisal for her protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, while S1 stated he conducted an investigation, there is little evidence in the record that would establish that the Agency took appropriate corrective action to address the harassment. <span class="Italic">Rockymore, supra.</span> (The Commission noted that beyond the Manager's assertion that she conducted an investigation, there was little evidence to show that the purported investigation was sufficient). There is no evidence in the record that would demonstrate why S1 thought a three day suspension was reflective of the severity of the conduct. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that would indicate that the Agency took any steps to ensure the harassment would not occur again, such as providing CW2 with anti-harassment training beyond the non-effective annual training he had received previously. Further, since the record indicates that this harassment likely affected more than just Complainant, the Agency should have provided the whole Commissary with anti-harassment training. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091468 (Aug. 31, 2012) (The Agency failed to take prompt and effective corrective action when it failed to provide training to a harasser, and when it failed to provide anti-harassment training to all employees where the actions were widespread in the office).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, we find that the Agency is liable for any acts of harassment that occurred after it was put on notice of the harassment on August 30, 2010, and any compensatory damages Complainant may be entitled to for that harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's duty to investigate arises upon having knowledge of alleged harassment, even if the alleged victim does not request that the agency pursue the matter. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120130622 (2015), the Commission found, without deciding whether harassment had occurred, that the agency was not liable for any harassment, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we assume that Complainant established elements 1-4, we must find that she was unable to establish her sexual harassment claim because the record establishes that Complainant did not notify management about any of the incidents until August 4, 2010. Complainant stated throughout the record that she did not report the incidents after they occurred, nor were there any witnesses to the incidents. There is also no evidence in the record that would establish that the sexual harassment was done so openly and in front of others that the Agency should have known that it was occurring.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, the record shows that on August 4, 2010, Complainant told her supervisor about the sexual harassment and asked that it be kept "off the record." The supervisor properly informed Complainant that it was "on the record" and he immediately reassigned the male coworker to a different building and instructed him to have no interactions with Complainant. The supervisor reported the alleged harassment and an investigation was immediately started. A preponderance of the evidence in the record establishes that the Agency's response to the harassment was prompt and thorough.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence in the record also establishes that the Agency's actions were effective, because Complainant stated that she has not had any further interactions with the male coworker since he was moved and she has not been subjected to any further sexual harassment. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that any other employees were subjected to sexual harassment after the male coworker was moved. Further, the record shows that the supervisor held an all staff meeting on August 5, 2010, where he reminded all staff that harassment is not permitted in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant acknowledged that she knew of the Agency's anti-harassment policy, and she had received training on how to report harassment. There is no evidence in the record that would establish that the Agency failed to act promptly and effectively to end the harassment. As a result, we find that a preponderance of the evidence of the record does not support a finding that the Agency is liable for the coworker's harassment.</p>
