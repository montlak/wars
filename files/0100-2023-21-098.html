<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-104"><span class="space">2.</span> Restoration of Employee Benefits</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a decision of questionable validity, the Commission held that an agency is not required to restore benefits to a victim of harassment if it has otherwise taken prompt and effective corrective action to bring an end to the harassment and prevent future incidents. In other words, if an agency has taken prompt and effective corrective action, it is not liable for any harm as a result of the initial incidents of harassment. The validity of the decision is in doubt because it would seem to fly in the face of the Commission's Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment which required taking actions to make the victim whole. Even though the Commission cited the Guidance, in <span class="Italic">Archie v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11558 (2003), it found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that complainant was subjected to sexual harassment when a co-worker (CW) told complainant about a sexually explicit dream he had about her and then forced his hand down the front of her pants. The AJ further found, however, that the agency was not liable for this harassment. The AJ noted that in instances of sexual harassment by a co-worker, the agency is liable if it knew or should have known of the harassing behavior and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. The AJ concluded that there was no dispute that as soon as complainant told her supervisor about the incident, the agency took prompt and appropriate action by sending CW home, immediately investigating complainant's allegation, and issuing CW a Notice of Removal. In addition, the AJ noted that the agency had credited the complainant with over half of the sick leave she took following the harassment. The AJ also found that there was no dispute that the agency had no reason to suspect that CW would engage in such activity prior to being informed about the October 17, 1998 event, as there had never been a similar claim made against him and, in fact, he had never been disciplined for any type of inappropriate behavior. Concluding that the agency took immediate and appropriate corrective action as soon as it had reason to know of the harassing behavior, the AJ found that it was not liable for the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to complainant's argument that the agency's corrective and remedial actions were not sufficient because it did not restore to her the full 90 hours of leave she used following the harassing incident and did not award her compensatory damages, the AJ noted that agency is not obliged to remedy the effects of harassment for which it is not liable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ then found that even assuming complainant was required to work in the trailer where the October 1997 incident took place upon her return to work, she failed to establish that she was subjected to a hostile work environment on the bases of sex, prior EEO activity or disability. The AJ noted that this incident was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to rise to the level of a hostile work environment. The AJ further found that the agency's request that complainant work in the trailer was not motivated by her membership in a protected class, but by the operational needs of the facility. The AJ also concluded that there is no nexus between the request that complainant work in the trailer and complainant's prior EEO activity, noting that complainant was not asked to work in the area immediately upon her return in early November 1997, but only during <span id="Page_889"></span>the heavy Christmas season and at times thereafter. The agency's final order adopted the AJ's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant essentially reiterates arguments she made in response to the agency's motion for summary judgment. She also argues that the AJ erred in concluding that the agency took sufficient remedial action, contending that leave she used due to the harassing incident should have been restored. In response, the agency asks that its FAD be affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations allow an AJ to issue a decision without a hearing when he or she finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). This regulation is patterned after the summary judgment procedure set forth in Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that summary judgment is appropriate where a court determines that, given the substantive legal and evidentiary standards that apply to the case, there exists no genuine issue of material fact<span class="Italic">. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby</span>, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court's function is not to weigh the evidence but rather to determine whether there are genuine issues for trial<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 249. The evidence of the non-moving party must be believed at the summary judgment stage and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in the non-moving party's favor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 255. An issue of fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find in favor of the non-moving party<span class="Italic">. Celotex v. Catrett</span>, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.</span>, 846 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1988). A fact is "material" if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. If a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, summary judgment is not appropriate. In the context of an administrative proceeding, an AJ may properly consider summary judgment only upon a determination that the record has been adequately developed for summary disposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning first to Issue 1, there is no dispute that complainant was sexually harassed by CW. Nor is there a dispute with regard to what actions the agency took in response to complainant's allegation. Both parties agree that the agency immediately sent CW home, conducted an investigation and disciplined CW appropriately. Complainant asserts, however, that the actions the agency took were insufficient to shield it from liability because the agency failed to reimburse her for the full 90 hours of leave she took as a result of the harassment. In making this argument, complainant relies on <span class="Italic">Quintero v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960836 (April 21, 1998), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980515 (June 29, 2000) (Commission found that the agency failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action, and was therefore liable for the harassment complainant suffered at the hands of a co-worker, when it did not reimburse her for leave reasonably taken as a direct result of the harassment and failed to offer her assurances that she would not be required to work alongside the harassing co-worker).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the AJ noted, in situations involving co-workers, the agency is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace only where the agency knows or should have known of the conduct, and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> (June 18, 1999) at p. 5 (Commission's long-standing guidance on employer liability for harassment by co-workers remains in effect--an employer is liable unless it knew or should have know of the misconduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action); Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (March 19, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ and the agency found that the agency took immediate and appropriate corrective action because it promptly sent CW home, conducted an investigation, issued a Notice of Removal to CW upon confirming complainant's allegations, and reassured complainant that she would not have to work with CW again.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (Policy Guidance) (March 19, 1990) states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When an employer receives a complaint or otherwise learns of alleged sexual harassment in the workplace, the employer should investigate promptly and thoroughly. The employer should take immediate and appropriate corrective action by doing whatever is necessary to end the harassment, make the victim whole by restoring lost employment benefits or opportunities, and prevent the misconduct from recurring. Disciplinary action against the offending...employee, ranging from reprimand to discharge, may be necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees with the AJ that the agency conducted a sufficiently thorough investigation of complainant's allegation in a timely manner. Moreover, although the Notice of Removal was reduced to a Last Chance Agreement through the grievance process, this agreement provided that CW would never work in the same facility as complainant and was sufficient to deter future acts of harassment by CW and others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that under <span class="Italic">Quintero</span>, appropriate corrective action necessarily includes the restoration of any leave reasonably taken as a direct result of the harassment and that the agency's failure to restore leave she took due to the harassment therefore renders it liable. Here, the facts do not support a conclusion that the agency's failure to reimburse the leave complainant used rendered its corrective action insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Quintero</span>, the record established that the agency failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action in that it failed to assure the complainant that she would not be required to work alongside the harasser. In addition, the complainant (C1) had been sexually assaulted in the past and the harassing co-worker's actions caused her to relive this memory, resulting in severe emotional distress and hospitalization for more than two weeks. Moreover, after this period of hospitalization in May 1994, C1 did not report back to work and, in September 1994, the Office of Worker's Compensation Program (OWCP) accepted her claim that she sustained a traumatic injury while in the performance of her job duties when she was sexually assaulted by a co-worker. As of the date of the hearing on C1's complaint, she had not returned to work. Under those circumstances, the Commission concluded that the agency's corrective actions were insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, however, there is no dispute that the agency conducted an immediate and thorough investigation, disciplined CW when it determined that he had harassed complainant, allowed her to take leave, and assured her that CW would never work in the same facility as she. The agency's prompt and effective action--ending the harassment and showing that complainant's concerns were taken seriously and that the agency would take the steps necessary to protect her--was sufficient to reassure her that the work environment is a safe place. Accordingly, we discern no basis on which to disturb the AJ's finding that the agency took immediate and appropriate corrective action when notified of the sexual harassment and therefore is not liable for that harassment. The agency's adoption of the AJ's finding of no discrimination in regard to Issue 1 is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>
