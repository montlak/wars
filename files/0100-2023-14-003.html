<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-4"><span class="space">B.</span> CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVILEGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">As a matter of EEO law, settlement negotiations are confidential and privileged. This includes settlement proposals made or discussed, as well as statements made during the course of negotiations. The reason for such a policy is to "facilitate candid interchange to settle disputes informally." <span class="Italic">Montague v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05920321 (1992). The fact that a settlement has been offered and any statements made by either party during the course of settlement discussions are not admissible evidence. Most adjudicative bodies have similar policies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because settlement negotiations are confidential, statements made during such negotiations cannot form the basis of a complaint. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01975252 (1998), the Commission found that racist remarks allegedly made by the agency representative during settlement discussions failed to state a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant's each allege in their individual complaints, dated April 17, 1997, that the agency's representative, a Labor and Employee Relations Teams Facilitator, made "inconsiderate" and "racist" remarks in response to a settlement proposal which their representative presented during a prehearing conference. Allegedly, the agency's representative responded in the presence of nine of the ten appellant's and their representative, that "those people don't have the aptitude to learn another language." The appellant's representative allegedly replied in pertinent part that, "so now Black females don't have the aptitude to learn Spanish!" The agency's representative then allegedly stated, "it would be a total waste of agency time and money on people who have not shown they have the ability to learn another language."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision dismissed the appellant's' complaints for failure to state a claim. The decision noted that the Commission has held that comments made during settlement negotiations are confidential and privileged and do not constitute admissible evidence of discrimination. Additionally, the decision indicated that the appellant's allegations were more properly addressed during the processing of the underlying claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the appellant's, through their representative, contend that racial statements serve no useful purpose in settlement negotiations, and, therefore, should not be protected and should be admissible in a separate proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency contends that the appellant's have failed to allege a direct harm affecting a term, condition, or privilege of their employment. The agency also contends that the Commission has repeatedly held that settlement negotiations, including any statements therein, are to be treated as confidential and privileged in order to facilitate candid interchange to settle disputes informally. The agency argues that to otherwise would unduly restrict discourse and have a chilling effect on the settlement process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the entire record, the Commission finds that the appellants' complaints fail to state a claim under 29 CFR Part 1614. The remarks allegedly were made in the context of a settlement discussion and, therefore, do not involve alleged unlawful discrimination regarding hiring, termination, compensation, or any other term, condition, or privilege of employment. Nor are the remarks sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also finds that question of the admissibility of the alleged remarks to prove discrimination in any other context is not properly before the Commission at this time. In so ruling, the Commission notes the agency's expressed concern about the potential chilling effect of disclosure on the settlement process. The Commission also suggests that the agency should be equally concerned about the potential chilling effect that the alleged remarks, if in fact they were made, could have had on the settlement process. Although the appellant's' allegations do not state a claim that should be processed under 29 CFR Part 1614, the Commission suggests that the agency investigate the appellant's' allegations to determine if training or other action is needed to prevent any such occurrences in the future<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(2) and (6).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dura v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01975249 (1998) (during settlement negotiations, an agency official stated that his personal character and integrity were affected as a result of filing the EEO complaint, and that the complainant would not be placed into the position as requested).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, actions taken by an agency during settlement may not form the basis of a new complaint, absent an allegation that action has been threatened if the complainant fails to accept a settlement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Keenan v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01975121 (1998), the Commission dismissed an allegation that the agency delayed a reassignment of the complainant and made it a part of settlement negotiations. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Keenan</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, appellant's position within the agency was to be abolished but could not be abolished until appellant was reassigned. Pending a permanent reassignment for appellant, she was temporarily detailed to another department within the agency in August of 1996. During the time of appellant's temporary detail she alleged that she was placed in a hostile work environment and subjected to continuing harassment and intimidation. The record herein indicates that also during the time appellant was temporarily detailed, she had entered into negotiations with the agency to settle a prior discrimination complaint. According to appellant's complaint which is the subject of the instant appeal, the agency wrongfully included a permanent reassignment for appellant in its settlement proposal. In her complaint appellant asserts that the agency purposely held up her permanent reassignment in order to force her to accept its proposal of settlement. The Commission is not persuaded by appellant's assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The gravamen of appellant's complaint and the instant appeal is that the agency improperly delayed appellant's reassignment and tied it in to settlement negotiations regarding appellant's prior complaint. The Commission notes that settlement negotiations, including any statements or proposals, are to be treated as confidential and privileged to facilitate a candid interchange to settle disputes informally<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05941002 (March 23, 1995). We have held that to allow a new complaint based on a settlement offer would defeat this purpose<span class="Italic">. See Montague v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920231 (May 2, 1992). The record is devoid of any evidence that there was a threat of adverse action if appellant failed to accept the agency's offer. In fact, appellant's permanent reassignment became effective December, 9, 1996, prior to the expiration of her temporary detail assignment. Appellant was not aggrieved by virtue of the agency's offer of settlement which included her permanent assignment; <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it did not adversely affect a term, condition, or privilege of appellant's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the exception in <span class="Italic">Keenan</span> is narrow. Carrying through on an agency action proposed prior to the initiation of settlement negotiations likely would not be viewed as a threat of adverse action for failure to settle. For example, if an agency proposed a complainant's removal for misconduct and, subsequently, the removal became part of negotiations to settle a previously outstanding complaint, a likely result of the failure to consummate an agreement would <span id="Page_335"></span>be the removal of the complainant. The Commission probably would not view such a scenario as containing a threat to remove if the complainant does not settle. The exception envisioned in <span class="Italic">Keenan</span> is one where the agency threatens some negative action premised solely on the complainant's failure to accept a settlement proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A02404 (2000), the Commission held that an alleged threat made during ADR did not state a claim and could not form the basis of a new complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jensen</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Settlement negotiations, including any statements or proposals, are to be treated as confidential and privileged to facilitate a candid interchange to settle disputes informally." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05941002 (March 23, 1995). To allow complainant to file a new complaint regarding the comments made by an agency official during settlement negotiations of a previously filed EEO complaint would defeat this purpose<span class="Italic">. See Millea v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980235 (May 21, 1998); <span class="Italic">Montague v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920231 (May 2, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, confidentiality is considered one of the "Core Principles" of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). "Parties who know that their ADR statements and information are kept confidential will feel free to be frank and forthcoming during the proceeding, without fear that such information may later be used against them." <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 3-16, 3-17 and Appendix H (November 9, 1999). Therefore, we find that complainant's claim regarding statements made by the counselor during a mediation meeting (claim 2), fails to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120132597 (2015) ("Without the maintenance of confidentiality, there would be a chilling effect on the utilization and success of ADR. ...Because the record establishes that the comments were made during mediation and not after it, we find that Complainant fails to state a claim.").</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other hand, the agency may not take advantage of information that it learns of in settlement negotiations to the detriment of the complainant. In an interesting scenario, the Commission found it was retaliation for a supervisor to deny training to the complainant because of her desire to leave that component of the agency, where the supervisor had learned of that desire through EEO settlement negotiations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01963662 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, actions taken subsequent to settlement are not confidential or privileged. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Muzny v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02488 (2000) (supervisor's failure to honor the terms of the settlement agreement could be considered evidence of hostile environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though settlement negotiations are taking place, events that happen outside the context of those negotiations may be admissible as evidence. In <span class="Italic">Newman v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120070789 (2008), the Commission found that evidence of an alleged termination threat made during a mediation was not admissible evidence. However, it also determined that the administrative judge erred in not admitting evidence of an alleged threat that occurred in the hallway outside the mediation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Newman</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find that in the instant case, the AJ erred in granting the agency's Motion to Preclude' Complainant From Introducing or Raising Any Evidence of Claim Related to an Alleged July 2002 threat. The record indicates that in her July 7, 2005 deposition, complainant alluded to the fact that AM threatened her with termination both during the mediation session, and outside of the mediation session. In her reply to the agency's Motion, complainant states "during a break from that same EEO mediation on July 15, 2002, [AM] and Complainant were in the stairwell together (outside of the mediation room and outside the presence of the mediator) when [AM] said to Complainant something to the effect of, "Your [evaluation] numbers are good now. They're going to be a lot lower. And I will see that you're terminated for this EEO action." Complainant argues that these comments are evidence of AM's retaliatory animus toward her. The AJ granted the Motion to Preclude these communications as inadmissible evidence because they constitute confidential settlement discussions. The Commission agrees that the threat allegedly made by AM during the mediation session is confidential, and therefore, not admissible as evidence in the instant case. However, in this particular case, complainant also alleged that AM threatened her with termination for participating in the EEO process when the parties were not in joint session and the mediator was not present. This communication is admissible evidence of AM's retaliatory motive.</p>
