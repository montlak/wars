<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-86"><span class="space">13.</span> Proximity in Time</h4>
<p class="noindent">An essential element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal is a showing that the alleged retaliation "followed the complainant's engagement in protected activity within such period of time that one can infer retaliatory motive." <span class="Italic">Speece v. USPS</span>, 01831994 (1984). When the investigative record only shows that appellant engaged in previous EEO activity but does not show when, the complaint should be remanded for further investigation to establish the dates of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The emphasis is on the proximity in time between the protected EEO activity and the adverse treatment, not simply the proximity in time between the filing of the complaint and the adverse treatment. So, for example, the Commission found retaliation in <span class="Italic">Solomon v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A50082 (2006), where the denial of leave occurred three weeks after the complainant entered an agreement settling her EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="italic">Karolyn E. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2021003151 (2021) (17 days between the disclosure and adverse action was temporally close enough to infer causation); <span class="Italic">Zonia C. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120161120 (2016) (alleged discriminatory conduct, i.e., yelling and pushing complainant's hand off a computer mouse, occurring within weeks of the responsible management official having to testify at complainant's EEO hearing sufficiently proximate in time and reasonably likely to deter complainant and others from engaging in the EEO process); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720060004 (2006) ("We note that the filing of an EEO complaint is not the conclusion of protected activity by the anti--retaliation provisions of Title VII. Rather, following the filing of a complaint, significant interaction between a complainant, the alleged discriminating officials, and the agency's EEO officials generally occurs,..."). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120140774 (2014). Nor is there any requirement that the complainant be successful in her EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120091994 (2010) (finding of retaliation where latest EEO activity was grant of summary judgment to agency in U.S. district court case).</p>
<p class="noindent">"The causal connection may be inferred by evidence that the protected conduct was closely followed by the adverse action." <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01933573 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Grant v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.</span>, 622 F.2d 43 (2d Cir. 1980)). There is no set period of time in which the Commission will infer retaliatory motive. Cases are reviewed on an individual basis. However, the Commission's trend in recent years has been to significantly decrease the time interval that will support an inference of retaliation in the absence of any other evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proximity in time between the protected activity, the adverse action and the knowledge of agency officials taking or recommending the action are prerequisites to establishing reprisal. But it is also clear that those elements, standing alone, generally will not give rise to a finding of reprisal, though particularly close proximity in time may do so. To prevail, the employee must present other evidence tending to establish a retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Carmelita S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142795 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's entire claim appears to rest on the closeness in time between the initiation of her previous EEO complaints and the two disciplinary actions at issue in her complaint. We certainly agree that such temporal proximity is enough to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. To raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the OIC's motive, however, Complainant must, as we emphasized above, go a step further and present enough evidence to support an inference that the reason that the OIC gave for placing her in EAL and ultimately terminating her, namely that she falsified route information, was a pretext for retaliation. On this crucial issue, Complainant did not provide evidence of any of the indicators of retaliatory motive described above. She has not submitted any sworn statements from other witnesses or documents that contradict the explanation provided by the OIC or which call the OIC's veracity <span id="Page_1536"></span>into question. We therefore find, as did the AL that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to Complainant's claim of reprisal in connection with her being placed on EAL and subsequently terminated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission relied on the short period of time between the complainant's EEO activity and the change in the agency CEO's treatment of her to support its conclusion that the CEO "pursued a vendetta" against the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jacquetta C. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2019002196 (2020). The Commission noted that after the CEO learned that the complainant engaged in the EEO process, the CEO threatened the complainant with disciplinary action, tried to demote her, and denied her a retention incentive. The Commission found that these adverse actions followed the complainant's protected activity within such a period of time that retaliatory motive could be inferred in <span class="Italic">Jacquetta C</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant engaged in prior EEO activity as she stated that she inquired about initiating the EEO process on November 18, 2017, she filed an informal complaint on November 25, 2017, and then a formal complaint on December 21, 2017. Complainant withdrew the prior complaint in February 2018. The record reflects that the CEO learned at some point between November 25, 2017-December 21, 2017, that Complainant was pursuing the EEO complaint process. Subsequently, Complainant was subjected to adverse treatment in the form of being threatened with ER/LR disciplinary action on several occasions, an attempt to demote her and the denial of her retention incentive. We find that these adverse actions followed Complainant's protected EEO activity within such a period of time that retaliatory motivation may be inferred. We find that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further finds that the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its denial of Complainant's retention incentive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the Agency explained as to claim (1)(a) that the CEO denied Complainant a retention incentive based on a Fraud/Waste/Abuse complaint in late June/early July 2017 from Employee 2. The CEO also claimed that Complainant failed to disclose the tenant in her Agency housing unit, which he stated was dishonest and against policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant now bears the burden of establishing that the Agency's stated reasons are merely a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960403 (Dec. 9, 1996). Complainant can do this directly by showing that the Agency's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. <span class="Italic">Tx. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant attempts to establish pretext by challenging the validity of the reasons cited by the CEO. The CEO stated that he based his denial decision on Complainant's performance and conduct. S1 stated in her affidavit that an employee may receive a retention incentive if they are in a hard-to-fill critical position, with specialized skills or competencies and/or they are likely to leave if they do not receive a retention incentive. In terms of whether Complainant's prior EEO activity was a factor in the denial of her retention incentive, S1 stated that she could not say for certain, however, she suspected given the timing and other retention incentive approvals that it was a factor. S1 asserted that she recommended a retention incentive for Complainant as she was in a hard to fill position, had several other job offers and was performing beyond expectations. S1 noted that Complainant had previously received two retention incentives during her time as a Clinical Pharmacist at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The DHSA stated in his affidavit that he agreed with S1 that Complainant deserved the retention incentive. The DHSA asserted that the denial of the retention incentive was strictly the CEO's decision. The DHSA observed that the Pharmacy and Health Center Joint Commission Review returned results higher than any other time in the history of the institution, and that in his opinion Complainant contributed greatly to this while she was Chief Pharmacist. The DHSA attached to his affidavit an extensive list of Pharmacy accomplishments during Complainant's tenure as Chief Pharmacist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Fraud/Waste/Abuse complaint referenced by the CEO, S1 stated that she never saw the allegations that Employee 2 purportedly submitted after Complainant gave her a sub-par mid-year evaluation. S1 stated that Complainant was on a one-year supervisory probation and did not receive Supervisory 101 training until 10 months into her supervisory tenure. S1 asserted that Complainant made great efforts to improve as a supervisor. According to S1, in one of the Pharmacy Reviews conducted during Complainant's tenure, the reviewer stated on September 27, 2017, that the current staff does appear to work well together. As for the issue of Complainant participating unprofessionally on Skype messaging with subordinates, S1 stated that she issued a Letter of Expectation to Complainant and all Pharmacy staff, and the matter was reflected in Complainant's PMAP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that Complainant's prior EEO activity was clearly a factor in the CEO's decision to deny Complainant a retention incentive. The CEO became vindictive toward Complainant beginning with his reaction to her proposed termination of Employee 1. Subsequent to nullifying the proposed termination, the CEO subjected Complainant to measures that included pursuing a Fraud/Waste/Abuse report for which he lacked documentation, having three pharmacy reviews performed even though usually only one was conducted each year and seeking Complainant's demotion despite a clear consensus as to Complainant being an excellent Chief Pharmacist. The CEO became aware of Complainant's prior EEO activity at some point between November 25, 2017-December 21, 2017, and he ordered the denial of Complainant's retention incentive approximately four months later. The record supports that the CEO may have been displeased with Complainant's proposed termination of Employee 1, a proposed termination that was prompted by Employee 1's fundamental mistake that could have endangered patients. We note that not only did the CEO reverse the proposed termination, he also ensured that Employee 1 received a perfect rating for her PMAP closeout by forcing the DHSA to sign the document. In fact, the DHSA stated that he feared retaliation from the CEO if he did not comply. We observe that no other Pharmacist during the relevant time period was denied a retention incentive. Additionally, neither of the two Pharmacists who received retention incentives during the relevant time period had prior EEO activity. We find that the CEO's explanation for denying Complainant a retention incentive is unworthy of credence. We find that the denial of Complainant's retention incentive was attributable to reprisal based on Complainant's prior EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the merits of this claim, Complainant engaged in prior EEO activity when she filed an informal EEO complaint on November 25, 2017, and subsequently filed a formal complaint on December 21, 2017. Complainant maintains that the CEO issued threats of ER/LR disciplinary action against her on seven occasions from November 2017 to April 2018. We find that the identified incidents, considered cumulatively, were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment and that the incidents were attributable to retaliatory harassment based on Complainant's prior EEO activity. Furthermore, the conduct was sufficiently material to deter Complainant or others from engaging in protected activity in the given context. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Complainant has established that she was subjected to a retaliatory hostile work environment as to claim (1)(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that it is clear the CEO pursued a vendetta against Complainant in part based on her prior EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission allowed an inference of causation in <span class="italic">Karolyn E. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2021003151 (2021), where 17 days passed between the disclosure and the complainant's receipt of a reprimand for discourteous behavior. The agency defended the reprimand with evidence that the complainant was previously disciplined for similar behavior. Finding pretext, the Commission noted that agency witness' testimony was contradictory and the agency failed to follow its own disciplinary policies in <span class="italic">Karolyn E</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency issued Complainant the Reprimand 17 days after learning of her EEO activity and we find that this close temporal proximity is sufficient to infer a causal nexus. Accordingly, we find that Complainant established a <span class="italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Agency proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for issuing the Reprimand. S1 testified that he issued the Reprimand because S2 reported to him that Complainant yelled and was discourteous to her. Since Complainant had previously been counseled for similar behavior, the next appropriate step in the disciplinary process was a reprimand. HT at 243.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the AJ erred by substituting her own judgment for the Agency's business reasons for issuing the Reprimand. However, we find that the AJ did not substitute her own judgment; rather, the AJ found the management officials' proffered reasons were not worthy of belief. For example, the AJ noted that while the Agency represented that Complainant's behavior was disturbing and required an urgent response, S2 did not schedule a timely follow-up meeting or memorialize their conversation until after she was notified of Complainant's EEO activity. The AJ also observed that neither S1 nor S2 completed the employment action soon after the incident or placed the Reprimand in Complainant's OPF. Consequently, the AJ determined that the Agency's actions were "illogical" and management's responses were not persuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's determination that the Agency's proffered reasons were pretexts for discrimination. Pretext can be demonstrated by showing such weaknesses, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the Agency's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence. <span class="italic">See Opare-Addo v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120060802 (Nov. 20, 2007) (finding that the agency's explanations were confusing, contradictory, and lacking credibility, which were then successfully rebutted by the complainant), <span class="italic">request for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080211 (May 30, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1537"></span>S2 testified that when she spoke with LERR on August 10, 2016, he indicated that a reprimand would be the appropriate next step. HT at 172. However, we find that this testimony is inconsistent with other evidence. The record shows that S2 emailed S3 on August 10, 2016, to inform her of a "brewing situation" due to an employee's request for a reassignment. Hearing Exhibit 35. S2 also emailed LERR on August 10, 2016, writing that Complainant raised issues regarding S1's deadlines, prioritization of work, and holding Complainant accountable. S2 explained to LERR that she wanted to "respond in writing to the concerns raised on the call." Hearing Exhibit 36. At the end of the day, on August 10, 2016, S2 sent S3 a follow-up email to inform her that she was unable to schedule a meeting with Complainant for the next day because she had computer issues and Complainant had already finished her workday. Hearing Exhibit 34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the email evidence shows that at the end of the day on August 10, 2016, after S1 spoke with S3 and LERR, her plan was to conduct an in-person discussion regarding Complainant's behavior, and there is no mention of a reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S2 also provided contradictory testimony that LERR5 recommended that she meet with Complainant in-person to discuss her conduct, but she did not recall if she met with Complainant prior to the issuance of the Reprimand. HT at 164-5, 190. We find that S2's inconsistent testimony about LERR's recommended next step, in addition to the email evidence showing that S2 had no plans to issue a reprimand to Complainant following her discussion with LERR on August 10, 2016, demonstrates pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we agree with the AJ that S1's decision to not place the Reprimand in Complainant's OPF is evidence of pretext for discrimination. An Agency's departure from, or failure to apply its policies, without explanation, can be probative of pretext. <span class="italic">See Carl M. v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120160005 (Nov. 16, 2017). The Agency's policy stipulates that reprimands shall be maintained in an employee's OPF for a determined length of time not to exceed two years. ROI at 414. Here, S1 testified that he did not place the Reprimand into Complainant's OPF nor contact Human Resources to initiate the process. HT at 310-11. We note that S1 did not offer an explanation for his deviation from the Agency's policy of including a reprimand to the OPF, additional indication of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that the Reprimand was intended to chill Complainant's EEO activity. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.101(b) provides that no person shall be subject to retaliation for opposing any unlawful discriminatory practice or for participating in any stage of the EEO complaint process. The statutory anti-retaliation provisions prohibit any materially adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. <span class="italic">Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. 53 (2006). Although petty slights and trivial annoyances are not actionable, adverse actions such as reprimands, threats, negative evaluations, and harassment are actionable. Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation at II.B. We find that the issuance of the Reprimand was an adverse action that would reasonably deter a person from engaging in protected activity. As such, we REVERSE the Agency's final order rejecting the AJ's finding of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The passage of a year or more between the protected activity and the adverse action does not give rise to an inference of retaliation. <span class="Italic">See O'Neill v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45961 (2005); <span class="Italic">Webster v. USPS</span>, 01842494 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Knight v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54821 (2006), the Commission drew no inference of retaliation where at least six months had passed between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. In doing so, the Commission cited with approval <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Ferguson Construction Co.</span>, 231 F.3d 1248 (10th Cir. 2001), holding that a three month period was insufficient to support such an inference. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Klein v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120061721 (2008); <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A62609 (2006). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Roxane C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120142363 (2016) (finding nexus where the alleged discriminatory act, removing the complainant from a training roster, was committed within three months of the complainant's protected activity and management conceded that why the agency removed the complainant from the roster was an "open question"). However, when the adverse action follows protected activity by a period of only one month, an inference of retaliation is justified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jiminez v. USPS</span>, 01870265 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Conrad v. Attorney General</span>, 01200412751 (2006) (inference of retaliation strong where demotion followed reporting alleged harassment by only three weeks); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120131310 (2013) (inference of retaliation where protected activity and agency action were separated by three months).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Beverly-Grogg v. USPS</span>, 01821029 (1983), the employee prevailed by presenting evidence that, shortly after filing her complaints, she was transferred to a larger mail route and then constantly criticized for lateness in her deliveries. She also presented evidence that a negative comment was made about her assistance to another employee who was considering filing a complaint, that she was "clocked" at the restroom and that generally she was watched closely and questioned often about her job performance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The calculation of time does not always begin on any one specific date, such as the date the formal complaint was filed. If a claim is still pending when the adverse action is taken, the complainant has met the timing requirement. In <span class="Italic">Moreno v. Secretary of Education</span>, 05970983 (2000), the agency argued that two years passed from the time the complainant filed the formal complaint to the time the adverse action was taken. The Commission, on the other hand, found that there was a casual connection based on closeness in time, noting that the "complainant's prior EEO complaint, while filed in 1990, was being processed through April 19, 1993, the date on which the agency forwarded the current complaint to the EEOC District Office for consolidation with the prior complaints awaiting a hearing." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission in <span class="Italic">Moreno</span> therefore found that the complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0720140029 (2015), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the prior protected activity was too remote from the alleged incidents of retaliation to support an inference of causation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the hearing, the parties stipulated that Complainant filed EEO complaints against S3 in September and November of 2007, and that the Commission found in favor of the Agency on these complaints at the end of August 2010. Joint Hearing Exhibit 1, &#x00B6; 9. On appeal, the Agency argues that the two-year and three-year intervals between the November 2007 complaints and the two incidents are too long to support an inference of causation. We disagree. The prior complaints against S3 were still active when the first incident occurred, and were ultimately ruled on by the Commission barely more than seven months before the second occurrence. In addition, S3, who had been named as the responsible management official in the prior complaints, was the same individual Complainant alleged was responsible for the conduct at issue herein. This evidence is sufficient to support an inference of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cedar v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A44162 (2006). the Commission held that its administrative judge erred in finding no causal connection because over a year had passed between the filing of the complaint and the nonpromotion at issue, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the AJ's analysis to be faulty. First, the length of time between the filing of the two complaints is irrelevant. For temporal proximity purposes, the important points in time are the discriminatory act and the most recent protected activity prior to the discriminatory act. In considering the time elapsed, "the proper inquiry includes consideration of what has transpired since the complainant initiated EEO Counselor contact or filed his formal complaint, including communications between the EEO office and management or co-worker witnesses, investigative interviews or execution of affidavits, and so on." <span class="Italic">Hicks v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01994651 and 01A00380 (April 24, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the investigation of complainant's pregnancy discrimination claim was actively-underway during the selection process. Indeed, less than one month before complainant was informed of her nonselection, one of the management officials who recommended employees for promotion to the position complainant was seeking, was required to submit an affidavit in the investigation of complainant's pregnancy discrimination case.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Report of Investigation Tab F. This is sufficient to establish temporal proximity between complainant's prior protected activity and the nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Goblirsch-Erickson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110390 (2011) (selecting official was aware of complainant's previous EEO activity but no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where that was the only evidence in support of retaliation claim and case was settled a year and a half before the disputed nonselection).</p>
<p class="noindent">The passage of time between the protected activity and the adverse personnel action at issue is only one factor for the Commission to consider in determining whether an inference of reprisal is warranted. The mere passage of a significant amount of time is not sufficient to dissipate the inference if there are other factors present. For example, in <span class="Italic">Moss v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01913531 (1992), the Commission found that, even though the previous EEO activity had occurred two years prior to the complainant's nonselection, an inference of reprisal was still permissible because the selecting official in the current complaint of nonpromotion was the successful candidate for the promotion in the previous complaint. The selecting official's close involvement with the previous complaint was sufficient to raise an inference of reprisal. The passage of one year between the last complaint activity and alleged reprisal did not prevent an inference of retaliation when the complainant was still in the same organizational unit of the agency and involved with the same individuals implicated in his previous complaints. <span class="Italic">See White v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01921110 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will look at the circumstances of each complaint rather than apply a strict timing formula. For example, in <span class="Italic">Leatherman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01983615 (2000), the Commission found retaliation despite the passage of three years since the complainant's prior EEO activity. The complainant alleged that her second-line supervisor directed her first-line supervisors to "lean on her" in an effort to systematically retaliate against her for her previous protected activities. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Leatherman noted</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that because complainant's protected activity took <span id="Page_1538"></span>place in 1991 and the LOR was issued in 1994, an inference of reprisal cannot be drawn. While the period of time between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation can be telling, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case can be established by other evidence tending to establish retaliatory motivation<span class="Italic">. See Hochstadt</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wibstad v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972699 (August 14, 1998). We find that complainant provided sufficient evidence on which to base an inference of retaliatory motivation. Specifically, complainant alleged that a hearing on the sexual harassment case involving S2, for which she previously gave a deposition, was scheduled for 1995 and that she was retaliated against not only due to her 1991 deposition, but to discredit her testimony at the 1995 hearing. The agency failed to respond to this claim. Moreover, co-workers indicated that management promoted an atmosphere of intimidation and made trouble for employees who did not fall into line, such as complainant. One co-worker (CW6) testified that when she began working for the agency in November 1991, S2 told her not to associate with complainant. Another coworker (CW5) testified that S1, at the direction of S2, forced her to write a memo saying complainant "put work off on her." Based on this evidence, we find that complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation in regard to the issuance of the LOR....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Howard v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060026 (2008), where the protected activity took place three years before the retaliation. In upholding the finding the administrative judge that the agency had engaged in retaliation, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Howard</span>, explained that proximity in time is only factor that can establish nexus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Social Security Admin.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960403 (Dec. 6, 1996) (<span class="Italic">citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973))., Specifically, in a reprisal claim, and in accordance with the burdens set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology,</span> 425 F. Supp. 318, 324 (D. Mass.), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976), and <span class="Italic">Coffman v. Department of Veteran Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960473 (November 20, 1997), a complainant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal by showing that: (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the agency was aware of the protected activity; (3) subsequently, he or she was subjected to adverse treatment by the agency; and (4) a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. <span class="Italic">Whitmire v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A00340 (September 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency takes issue with the AJ's finding that complainant established the fourth prong of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; that a nexus existed. While the agency is correct in noting that some Commission cases have held that a few months do not amount to temporal proximity and establish a causal connection, we agree with the AJ's legal argument that an examination of the entire record and consideration of all the facts result in a finding of discrimination. The mere passage of time between the protected activity and the adverse action is only one factor to consider and is not sufficient to dissipate the inference of reprisal if there are other factors present. <span class="Italic">See Moss v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal. No. 01913531 (January 27, 1992) (a temporal proximity of more than two years did not disprove retaliation if the facts as a whole raise an inference of reprisal). While the passage of time between the adverse action and the protected activity can be telling, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case can be established by other evidence tending to establish retaliatory motivation. <span class="Italic">Leatherman v. Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No 01983615 (April 26, 2000). Here, we agree with the AJ's finding that the record as a whole reflected a retaliatory motive against complainant. Specifically, the record reflects that M2 took a special interest in complainant after she accused him of creating a hostile work environment. M2 purposely stayed apprised of issues concerning complainant, even after she left his supervision. The record also reflects an overall retaliatory animosity by M2 towards complainant since she engaged in the protected activity. M2 made it a point to be actively involved in the adverse actions alleged in the complaint. Additionally, the record supports the AJ's conclusion that M1's role in the adverse actions was that of an obedient subordinate to M2 and he was following M2's orders. Additionally, the record reflects that the agency's articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons were merely pretext for reprisal discrimination, The AJ's findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record, and therefore we AFFIRM the AJ's finding of reprisal discrimination and REVERSE the agency's final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01955261 (1997), the Commission upheld a finding of reprisal by the administrative judge, even though the protected activity had taken place six years earlier. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> noted that the responsible management official had been made aware of the protected activity more recently, and that it was still a common topic of conversation around the office:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented is whether appellant has proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was discriminated against on the basis of reprisal when she was not given a monetary performance award (MPA) for the evaluation period of July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant contends that the testimony of the Director of Training (DOT) was inconsistent and not credible, in line with the finding of the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the AJ found that the DOT, who was the RMO responsible for submitting names of candidates for MPAs to the Position Management Board, was not credible when he testified that appellant was not considered for a MPA because her name had not been submitted to him. This finding was due to the fact that the DOT had contradicted himself because he had previously told the EEO Counselor that he had received appellant's name from appellant's first-line supervisor (S-1). This earlier admission was corroborated by S-1 and appellant's second-level supervisor (S-2), who testified that he had received appellant's name from S-1 and had passed it on to the DOT. In addition, while the DOT told the investigator that appellant had not been recommended by S-1 for an award, he also indicated that appellant was one of two employees he had cut from the list to be submitted to the PMB. Because of this conflicting testimony, and the testimony of S-1 and S-2, the AJ rejected as pretextual the agency's articulated reason for not giving appellant a MPA, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that her name was not submitted to the DOT.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ further found that the DOT did not submit appellant's name to the PMB in reprisal for her prior EEO complaint activity. Although appellant's prior EEO activity had occurred in 1986-1988, the DOT testified that he had been made aware of it in 1992 by an unidentified employee who cited appellant's success with her previous EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the AJ determined that the testimony of the DOT and other witnesses supported the finding that appellant's prior EEO complaint still generated interest and conversation in her department, despite the fact that it had been filed six years previously. The AJ then concluded that this finding supported in turn the reasonable inference that appellant's successful prior filing had "generated lingering tension" in the workplace. The AJ found that this became apparent from the testimony of other witnesses, one of whom testified that appellant's former supervisor had stated that appellant would not receive an award due to the residual tension stemming from her prior EEO complaint. In this regard, appellant testified, without contradiction, that she had received awards before filing her previous complaint, but had not received any since that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, appellant testified that subsequent to filing her prior complaint, she had been recommended for cash awards by three supervisors but was denied them despite having achieved outstanding performance ratings of level 5. In contrast, one other employee had received a cash award even though her performance, at level 4, was less than outstanding. Taking all the above facts and findings into consideration, the AJ concluded that discrimination on the basis of reprisal had occurred when the DOT did not submit appellant's name to the PMB for a MPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, the Commission will not disturb the credibility determinations of an AJ. The Commission has consistently held that credibility determinations require more deference than other findings of fact. <span class="Italic">See Gaithers v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890894 (Nov. 9, 1989); <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Gould</span>, 808 F.2d 493, 499 (6th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. City of Bessemer City</span>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985). In the present case, we find that the agency failed to show that the AJ had erred in her credibility determination or findings of fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, after a careful review of the record, including contentions made on appeal, the Commission finds that the AJ's RD accurately summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. We, therefore, discern no basis to disturb the AJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to appellant's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112242 (2012) (six years between protected activity and adverse treatment did not defeat inference of causal connection when RMO allegedly made statements critical of complainant, such as, "she sues everyone"). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Peace-Jackson v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01980251 (2001) (there was no inference of a causal connection where the alleged retaliation took place four years after the protected activity and there was no evidence that the present supervisors knew of past activity); <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956932 (1997) (four years between the prior activity and the personnel action does not justify inference of a causal connection even when combined with the allegation that the past and present supervisors were friends).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McHugh v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120072925 (2012), the Commission also found that three years between the protected activity and the adverse actions of suspension and removal were causally connected where the complainant had been labeled as a "troublemaker":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A preponderance of the evidence also establishes that reprisal towards Complainant's prior protected EEO activity more likely than not played a role in the Agency's actions. The record establishes that Complainant's termination was the culmination of three years of retaliation towards <span id="Page_1539"></span>Complainant. The record establishes that after Complainant engaged in EEO activity, he was repeatedly labeled by management as a "troublemaker" and as someone who "causes trouble," and management officials told subordinates to "stay away from" Complainant. The record also establishes that reprisal was rampant throughout all of CSMS, and every employee feared reprisal by CSMS management officials. For example, the EEO Counselor noted in the report that amongst the CSMS employees interviewed there were widespread feelings of intimidation and fear, and that "[m]ost employees work under constant threat of losing their jobs if they speak out against unfair treatment." CSMS employees told the Counselor that the action taken against Complainant was a way to let them know that the same could happen to them if they spoke out about managements' unfair treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the record establishes at least two other white employees were permitted to park in spaces other than their own, and they were never questioned about it let alone disciplined. Further, many individuals, including officials within the Agency, did not feel that termination was a suitable disciplinary action for Complainant's offense of parking in the wrong parking spot and refusing to talk about it after it had already been resolved. For example, after reviewing all of the evidence including Complainant's personnel file, Human Resources recommended a suspension from 15 to 30 days for Complainant's conduct. CSMS management officials ignored this recommendation. The DOD hearings examiner found that the removal was harsh, stated that he was surprised that Human Resources' recommendation was ignored by management officials, and also recommended less severe discipline such as a suspension and relocation. CSMS management officials also ignored these recommendations and continued with their decision to terminate Complainant. The EEO Counselor noted in the report that while discipline was appropriate, the punishment that management chose against Complainant was "harsh in comparison to that received by others for more severe offenses." Finally, the AJ noted that she did not find Complainant's refusal to answer managements' continuous questions about the parking lot incident to be unreasonable, and that "[p]arking in the wrong parking space and refusing to continually answer a question that is asked repeatedly seems little cause for termination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision to terminate Complainant instead of giving him more appropriate discipline was motivated by discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span> towards Complainant's race and in reprisal for his prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the years, the Commission has shortened the period of time between the protected activity and the adverse treatment that will support an inference of retaliation. Generally, that time period is now measured in months. However, there is no <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule and the Commission will look to other factors in determining if an inference of retaliation exists. For example, in <span class="Italic">Neal v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40059 (2005), the Commission found that a period of two years did not negate an inference of retaliation where the RMO was closely involved with the previous complaint and had ongoing obligations under the settlement agreement reached in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent">As previously noted, in <span class="Italic">Knight v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54821 (2006), the Commission found that a six-month period between the protected activity and the adverse treatment did not support an inference of retaliation. However, in <span class="Italic">Leung v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120063435 (2007), the Commission found that a three-month interval did support such an inference, particularly where there was other evidence of reprisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that a nexus may be shown by evidence that the adverse treatment followed the protected activity within such a period of time and in such a manner that a retaliatory motive is inferred. The Supreme Court has held that the temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and the adverse employment action must be "very close." <span class="Italic">See Clark County School District v. Breeden,</span> 532 U.S. 268 (2001). In this case, we find that the approximately three month time span between complainant's EEO activity and his termination, coupled with the personal manner in which complainant and the Postmaster discussed complainant's concerns that he was subjected to national origin discrimination, establishes a nexus between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. Consequently, we find that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD found that the agency provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. However, the Postmaster's statement that complainant was a temporary casual employee whose term had ended is the only explanation for terminating complainant provided by the agency. While the Postmaster's statement correctly notes that casual employees are appointed for specific terms at a time, it is not a specific explanation of the issue at hand: Why did the agency choose to terminate complainant's employment on July 1, 2005, although it had renewed his employment at the end of each term since October 2000? The Postmaster's response does not address this question. In fact, the Postmaster contends that complainant performed well in his position before he was terminated. Significantly, the District Manager that the Postmaster identified as making the decision to terminate complainant did not submit an affidavit for the record. The Commission finds that the agency has failed to set forth, with sufficient clarity, a legitimate reason why it terminated complainant on July 1, 2005, such that he has been given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons are pretext. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990): <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997). The agency has therefore failed to provide an articulation of its reason for terminating complainant sufficient to overcome complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Prevo v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972832 (March 10, 2000). Therefore, we find that the agency retaliated against complainant when it failed to renew his casual appointment on July 1, 2005.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120120772 (2014) (three years between protected activity and nonselection where selecting official was RMO in previous complaint); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120141629 (2014) (inference permissible where EEO activity occurred in June/July 2013 and reassignment occurred in October/November 2013); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121587 (2014) (inference permissible where there were eight months between the protected activity and alleged retaliation where RMO was also named in the previous complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible that the proximity in time test will be satisfied for a complainant with respect to one alleged act of reprisal, but not another. For example, in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Chemical Safety &#x0026; Hazard Investigation Board</span>, 01A21995 (2003), the Commission found that the complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where she was removed from the SES and suspended within a month of protected activity. However, the Commission found that no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was established for a six-month suspension that occurred some 20 months later.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as a lengthy period of time between the protected activity and the adverse action does not necessarily defeat a retaliation case, at least one court has held that a very short time between the activity and adverse action does not necessarily establish retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Sherman v. Runyon</span>, 235 F.3d 406 (8th Cir 2000). In <span class="Italic">Sherman</span>, the plaintiff, deaf since birth and a 15-year Postal Service employee, reported to work two days after filing an EEO complaint alleging disability discrimination by his supervisor. The supervisor criticized the complainant's work, and the complainant became upset, and started "vocalizing" and signing. The supervisor allegedly misinterpreted the signs as threatening gestures, sent the complainant home, placed him on emergency suspension, and discharged him. The court found the supervisor's fear justifiable, and found that the agency in <span class="Italic">Sherman</span>, 235 F.3d at 410, did not engage in reprisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The timing of a plaintiff's discharge in relation to his protected activity can sometimes establish causation for the purpose of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case<span class="Italic">. See Smith v. Riceland Foods, Inc.</span>, 151 F.3d 813, 820 n.5 (8th Cir. 1998). However, timing on its own is usually not sufficient to show that an employer's non-discriminatory reason for discharge is merely pretext<span class="Italic">. See Stevens v. St. Louis Univ. Med. Ctr</span>., 97 F.3d 268, 272 (8th Cir. 1996). Instead, the timing of the discharge is usually evaluated in light of other evidence, or lack of other evidence, in the record<span class="Italic">. See Nelson v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc.</span>, 75 F.3d 343, 346 (8th Cir. 1996) ("In light of all of these circumstances, we cannot agree with the trial court that the mere coincidence of timing established a submissible case of retaliatory discharge.") The timing of the two incidents is insufficient, in light of the events of November 19 and the USPS' zero tolerance policy, to show retaliatory intent. The district court's finding that the USPS did not retaliate against Sherman is not clearly erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEO reached a similar conclusion in <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. Postmaster General</span>, 05991013 (2001), where only seven months passed between the filing of an EEO complaint and the complainant's reassignment. The Commission found the close proximity in time in <span class="Italic">Gilmore</span> did not support an inference of retaliation where the complainant's supervisor was not involved in the decision to transfer the complainant and the transfer was required because the complainant's work location no longer had any permanent light-duty positions available.</p>
<p class="noindent">The holdings of the Eighth Circuit and the EEOC were essentially affirmed in <span class="Italic">Clark County School District v. Breeden</span>, 532 U.S. 268, 121 S. Ct. 1508 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Supreme Court noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be "very close," <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co.</span>, 237 F.3d 1248, 1253 (CA10 2001)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Richmond v. Oneok, Inc.</span>, 120 F. 3d 205, 209 (CA10 1997) (3-month period insufficient); <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Derwinski</span>, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-1175 (CA7 1992) (4-month period insufficient). Action taken (as here) 20 months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Myklebust v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01982377 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even very close proximity in time is not sufficient to establish a claim of retaliation if the agency provides a legitimate nonretaliatory reason and there <span id="Page_1540"></span>is no other evidence of retaliatory motive. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120121451 (2015), the Commission found no retaliation where the denial of compensatory time and the supervisor's knowledge of the complaint occurred on the same day:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant maintains that the compensatory time was necessary because her assigned tasks were unrealistic and were not completed. Complainant also argues that her Supervisor became aware of her EEO activity the same day that he denied her compensatory time request. We can see how Complainant could believe this was more than a coincidence and thus retaliatory. However, the close proximity in time is not by itself sufficient to establish discrimination by refuting the Supervisor's assertion that Complainant could have completed the work within the hours of a regular duty day. We find that Complainant has not presented sufficient evidence to support her position and thus has not established that the rejection of her request for compensatory time was discriminatory. In terms of the Supervisor allegedly stating that he expected Complainant to work overtime without compensation, the Supervisor denied that he ever made such a comment. We find that Complainant has not submitted persuasive argument or evidence to refute the Supervisor's position.</p>
<p class="noindent">On occasion, acts that occur subsequent to the discriminatory personnel action will be relevant to a finding of reprisal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Harley v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 01862884 (1987), the Commission took notice of the fact that interview criteria for a selection did not exist at the time the interviews took place. The criteria also did not bear a direct relationship to the vacancy announcement. The Commission concluded that, in all probability, the criteria were devised after the RMOs learned that the complainant intended to file an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that harassment begins before the protected activity and extends to other employees who did not file EEO complaints does not preclude a finding of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Nale v. Postmaster General</span>, 01891085 (1989). The appellant established that the harassment increased after his complaint and was more severe than that of others who did not file complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">While the temporal proximity between protected activity and an adverse action, standing alone, may be sufficient to satisfy the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> requirements of a retaliation case, at least one court has held that it cannot be sufficient, without other evidence, to establish pretext. <span class="Italic">Stevens v. St. Louis Med. Ctr.</span>, 97 F.3d 268 (8th Cir. 1996).</p>
