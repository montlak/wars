<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-56"><span class="space">B.</span> ENTITLEMENT TO POSITIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many of the Commission's cases involve issues of relief related to the complainant's entitlement to a specific position. Complaints over failure to hire, failure to promote, or failure to receive details all entail remedies in which the complainant may be entitled to either a specific position, or at least a comparable position. In addition, in cases where employees were removed and are later reinstated, questions can arise concerning the employee's entitlement to a past position that was filled in the interim.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the evidence clearly establishes a complainant's entitlement to a position, it is not enough, from a remedial perspective, for the administrative judge to order that the agency review the complainant's application to determine whether the complainant would have been selected. That is what the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Brenton W. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120130554 (2017), a case involving air traffic control specialist who was removed from employment by Presidential Order for participating in a 1981 strike. When the ban on rehiring was lifted years later, the agency instituted a separate hiring policy in which it would only consider the strike participants for rehire at the <span id="Page_1749"></span>GS-9 level. The complainant alleged age discrimination when the agency refused to hire him as GS-12, and the Commission upheld the administrative judge's finding of age discrimination, but modified the remedial order that the agency consider the complainant for a GS-12, finding the complainant was absolutely entitled to be placed in the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that, because Complainant had been subjected to disparate treatment because of his age, the Agency must review Complainant's application, along with other qualified applicants, for the GS-12/13/14 position to determine if Complainant would have been selected. The AJ further found that, if the Agency determined that Complainant would have been selected, it must offer Complainant the position at the GS-12 level with all appropriate benefits until the date of his retirement. The AJ also ordered the Agency to provide EEO training to all related personnel, to review its policy of rehiring ex-PATCO applicants, and to post a notice of the finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the AJ's remedy for Complainant's nonselection is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, we note that the SO acknowledged that "it is probable that I would have selected the Complainant [for a bid GS-12/13/14 position under AEA-AAT-96-074-11006] if his name had appeared on any list presented to me." Additionally, Complainant was hired by the Department of Defense as a GS-11 Air Traffic Controller in July 1989, and was subsequently promoted to the GS-12 level in 1996. Further, the record reveals that the Agency hired GS-11 Department of Defense ATCs and immediately promoted them to the GS-12 level upon selection under bid AEA-AAT-96-0740-11006. Additionally, a Personnel Management Specialist testified that Agency policy provided that Department of Defense ATCs should be hired at their Department of Defense grade levels, unless the selecting official determined that the applicant could not perform at that grade.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we find that the evidence overwhelmingly reflects that Complainant was highly qualified for the Agency's ATC position and, absent discrimination, likely would have been selected at the GS-12 level, with promotion shortly thereafter. Consequently, in order to make Complainant whole, he must be retroactively promoted to a GS-12 position. Additionally, on appeal, Complainant contends that he would have continued to work for the Agency until he reached the age of mandatory retirement (56 years old), or nine years after his non-selection. We note that the record reflects that CP retired from subsequent employment at the Department of Defense at the age of 62. Therefore, we find that Complainant is entitled to back pay from the date of his nonselection for a GS-12 position, until the date of his 56th birthday, offset by any other pay and benefits he received during that time period. We further find that Complainant is entitled to an adjustment to his current retirement benefits to account for the effects of the Agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the passage of time between the complaint and its ultimate resolution makes it impossible to determine the precise level at which the complainant would have been hired, the Commission may order placement in the highest appropriate grade level. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01933987 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also notes that appellant is no longer employed by the agency. Although appellant was in no way responsible for the great length of time which has passed, it has unquestionably affected the circumstances of this matter. Notwithstanding, under Federal regulations, an identified victim of discrimination, such as appellant, is usually entitled to an "immediate and unconditional offer of placement...to the position the discriminatee would have occupied absent discrimination, or to a substantially equivalent position, even if the placement of the discriminatee results in the displacement of another of respondent's employees." Section (3), Appendix A to Part 1613--Policy Statement on Remedies and Relief for Individual Cases of Unlawful Discrimination. Therefore, the agency is ordered to place appellant in the highest wage grade Lithographic Worker position, for which appellant was qualified or a substantially equivalent position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the grade level is not at issue, there can be questions about the appropriate step within a grade that should be awarded. Generally, the employee will be entitled to credit for time served until relief is granted, and appropriate step increases should be included in any remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The concept of make-whole relief mandates that a complainant be placed in a position at the same grade level as the selectee if he is qualified for that grade level. In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01944385 (1996), the agency placed a complainant into a position at the GS-7 level as a remedy for discrimination. However, the female selectees who, like the complainant, were GS-7s at the time of the selections were all placed into the positions at the GS-9 level. The Commission had little difficulty determining that the complainant was entitled to be placed in a GS-9 position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's offer of a position must be specific. For example, in <span class="Italic">Healey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A52950 (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied,</span> 05A61010 (2006), the Commission held that the agency failed to comply with the order of the administrative judge noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the agency failed to fully comply with its November 2004 final order. The record reflects that the AJ's decision addressed complainant's non-selection for a position located in Specialty Clinics, Patient Care Services, VA Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa. In fully adopting the AJ's decision, the agency agreed to provide complainant with "make whole" relief, which included offering complainant another Patient Care Services position. We find that the agency's written offer of employment failed to comply with the November 2004 final order because the offer did not address any specifics of the position being offered, other than listing the job title, grade, and that the job would be located within the Iowa City Health Care System. We find, in order to fully comply with the November 2004 final order, the agency was required to provide complainant with an offer for a Patient Care Services position, GS-6, in Specialty Climes, Patient Care Services, VA Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa, or a comparable location in Iowa City, Iowa. Furthermore, because we find that the agency failed to fully comply with its November 2004 final order, we find that the agency is also required to recalculate and pay complainant additional back pay, with interest, and other benefits due complainant pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501 from November 2002 to the date complainant either accepts or fails to accept a revised offer from the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Healey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0420070007 (2007) (granting complainant's petition for enforcement).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant was discriminated against in the selection process, in most cases, will result in retroactive promotion as relief. However, because the goal of the Commission's remedial authority is to place the victim of discrimination where he or she would have been absent the discrimination, a permanent promotion is not always the proper remedy. In <span class="Italic">King v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940441 (1995), the Commission identified a situation in which retroactive promotion was not the appropriate relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, the previous decision properly concluded that appellant had met his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency gave him a "basic" rating on his application for Initial-Level Supervisor Candidacy because of his prior EEO activity. We have granted the agency's request for reconsideration of the previous decision, however, because we agree with the agency that make-whole relief for the agency's discrimination does not include retroactive promotion to an initial-level supervisory position as ordered by the previous decision. Appellant testified, without contradiction in the record, that clerks did not get promoted to Initial-Level Supervisory positions without first becoming 204(b) acting supervisors. Based on this evidence, we conclude that appellant's lack of 204(b) acting supervisory experience, not his "basic" rating, prevented him from obtaining a permanent Initial-Level Supervisory position. In addition, given the number of applicants who received "above average" and "superior" ratings, it appears that selections for Initial-Level Supervisory positions were highly competitive. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the award of a permanent Initial-Level Supervisory position exceeded make-whole relief for the agency's discrimination. Therefore, we order the agency to make appellant whole for the agency's discriminatory denial of 204(b) acting supervisory assignments for the period of time in which appellant's "basic" rating remained in effect without an opportunity for re-rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic rule in selection cases is that the complainant is entitled to promotion if any part of the selection process is discriminatory. In <span class="Italic">Pachecano v. Postmaster General</span>, 05990053 (2002), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the issue of relief, we find that the previous decision involved an erroneous interpretation of law when it found that complainant was not entitled to a retroactive promotion based on the AJ's finding of discriminatory treatment in this case. In a long line of decision, both the Commission and Judicial Courts have ruled that if the selection process is discriminatory at any phase, the applicant must be awarded full relief, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the position retroactively, unless the employer shows by clear and convincing evidence, that even in the absence of discrimination, the applicant would not have been selected<span class="Italic">. Shipley v. Dugan et al.</span>, 874 F. Supp. 933, 941 (S.D. Ind. 1995); <span class="Italic">Nanty v. Barrows Co.</span>, 660 F.2d 1327, 1333 (9th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">King v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 738 F.2d 255, 259 (8th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Lucious Pryor v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal no. 05980405 (August 6, 1999); <span class="Italic">Barbara J.</span> <span class="Italic">Gimbel v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01982882 (September 14, 2001). Placing such an onerous burden on the employer is proper, inasmuch as the employer's unlawful acts caused the difficulty in determining what would have resulted if there had been no discrimination<span class="Italic">. EEOC v. Spokane Concrete Products</span>, 534 F. Supp 518, 523-534 (E.D. Wash. 1982); <span class="Italic">Nanty v. Barrows,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1333. Thus, in a case such as this one, appellant is entitled to retroactive placement in the position, unless the agency can show by clear and convincing evidence that, even absent the discrimination, appellant would not have been hired by the agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> also 29 C.F.R. 1614.501(b); <span class="Italic">Day v. Mathews</span>, 530 F.2d 1083 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once a complainant shows that discrimination was the reason he was <span id="Page_1750"></span>eliminated from consideration for a position, there still remains a question of remedy. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05950309 (1996), the complainant demonstrated that the agency regarded him as physically disabled and eliminated him from consideration for a supervisory police officer position based on lack of physical agility. In remanding the case for further investigation in order to fashion a remedy, the Commission reminded the agency that it must support any conclusion that the complainant would not have been hired, even absent discrimination, by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> was remanded with the following instructions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that full relief in this case does not mandate appellant's automatic appointment to the Supervisory Police Officer position. The record indicates that as a predicate to appointment to the position, a qualified applicant must pass physical agility and drug tests. It further indicates that the agency instituted a hiring freeze in mid-March 1992, encompassing the Supervisory Police Officer position, but that it made the decision not to select appellant on February 24, 1992. Accordingly, the Commission will order the agency to allow appellant to take the appropriate tests and determine whether he is qualified for the Supervisory Police Officer position. If appellant passes these tests, the agency next must determine whether appellant would have been offered the position before it instituted the hiring freeze. That is, the agency must ascertain whether, in the normal course of business, it would have offered the position to appellant on or about February 24, 1992, conditioned on his successful completion of the physical agility and drug tests and, if appellant passed the tests, it would have honored its offer and placed him into the position despite the hiring freeze. If the agency would not have extended a conditional offer to appellant on February 24, it must ascertain whether it would have had sufficient time commencing from February 24 to continue the processing of appellant's application before the freeze went into effect on or about March 20, 1992. The burden is on the agency to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, either that it would not have made appellant a conditional offer that it would have honored or that it would not have had enough time to complete the processing of his application. In making these determinations, the agency should investigate, and document, its usual appointment/promotion practices and the time necessary to complete the testing process and finalize a promotion decision. If appellant would have been given a conditional offer that the agency would have honored or if the process would have been completed before the freeze went into effect, the agency shall appoint appellant to the position of Supervisory Police Officer, or a comparable GS-9 position, retroactive to the date he would have been promoted, and pay appropriate back pay and benefits. If the hiring freeze would have barred appellant's appointment in March 1992, the agency shall determine whether and, if so, when appellant would have been appointed to that or a comparable GS-9 position, effect his promotion, and pay appropriate back pay and benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although reinstatement to the same position under the same supervisor is the norm, the Commission will take into account special circumstances in ordering relief, including the past supervisor's discriminatory attitude. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120131556 (2014), the Commission order the complainant be reinstated under a different supervisor where his past supervisors had displayed hostility toward his accommodation requests:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We consider the AJ's observations regarding the animosity of S1, Complainant's immediate supervisor, and S2's hostility toward Complainant in the final months of Complainant's tenure with the Agency, during which Complainant's various requests for accommodation were met with denials because the two supervisors had already determined that Complainant could not succeed in the position. The AJ found the steps undertaken to accommodate Complainant's disabilities immediately prior to his separation were a sham and were motivated in part by S1 and S2's disbelief that Complainant's diabetes was a disabling condition. The AJ also found that S1 and S2 believed instead that Complainant was making excuses for his failure to progress as expected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur with the AJ's observations that whether Complainant would have succeeded in the position had he been accommodated from the time he entered on duty in May 2009, remains unknown because the initial accommodations he requested, specifically, an ergonomic chair and keyboard, voice recognition software, and a flexible schedule, were never provided. We note that Complainant identified a different supervisor willing to provide Complainant with adequate training (and presumably effective accommodations) and that this supervisor had done so in the past for other employees. We find this reassignment to the same position in a different supervisory chain is reasonable upon this finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, where a complainant establishes discriminatory separation, an order for reinstatement requires that the Agency offer to place Complainant in the position he would have held, absent discrimination, or a substantially equivalent one. Under the circumstances of the instant case, we find that appropriate make-whole relief includes ordering the Agency to reinstate Complainant to the position he held at the time he was terminated from the Agency, or to a substantially equivalent position, subject to the successful completion of the remaining months of his probation, and that he be provided immediately with effective reasonable accommodations. We find it appropriate to require that Complainant be placed in a position where he receives appropriate training, and that he reports to different supervisors than those whom the AJ found failed to fulfill their obligations under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the circumstances of this case do not meet the criteria for an award of front pay. We do not find that Complainant's former position has been abolished or that reinstatement would necessarily entail an antagonistic relationship between the Agency and Complainant in light of the identified Agency official who was willing to accept Complainant for training through reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We shall order the Agency to comply with the AJ's order of remedies, as slightly modified, plus our requirement that Complainant be reinstated with different supervisors to complete his probationary period.</p>
