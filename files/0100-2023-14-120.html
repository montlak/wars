<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-120"><span id="Page_432"></span><span class="space">VII.</span> SETTLEMENTS REACHED THROUGH OTHER PROCEDURES</h2>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has no authority to directly enforce settlement agreements entered in other dispute resolution processes, unless the agreement purports to resolve a claim of discrimination, or the complainant alleges the noncompliance is based on a discriminatory motive. An employee who alleges that the agency failed to implement a settlement of a grievance on the basis of national origin has stated a complaint of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DiCerbo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24522 (2003); <span class="Italic">Sotelo v. USPS</span>, 01831904 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">A settlement agreement that is entered into before the complainant initiates EEO counseling and not invoking allegations of discrimination in any other forum is not a legally binding settlement agreement for EEOC enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">Tittle v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A12067 (2002). By contrast in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120142463 (2014), the Commission found that it had jurisdiction over a grievance settlement for enforcement purposes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is some question about whether the agreement can be enforced under the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process because the parties technically entered into the settlement agreement in the grievance process. However, in this case Complainant filed her EEO complaint over the same suspension the day after she filed her grievance and several months before the agreement was finalized. Moreover, the agreement expressly stated, as one of its terms, that Complainant was withdrawing her EEO complaint (identified by case number). Therefore, we conclude that while also settling the grievance, this agreement was made "in conjunction with" the EEO process, and, therefore, the alleged breach is properly before us. <span class="Italic">See Title v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12067 (October 8, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where it is unclear whether a particular settlement agreement was in response to an EEO complaint or to some other complaint process such as a grievance and the settlement contains items that resolve issues of discrimination, the Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the agreement for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921134 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, the complainant initiated both an EEO complaint and a grievance. The complainant, with the assistance of the union, then entered a memorandum of understanding with the agency that partially resolved some issues raised in precomplaint EEO counseling. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that it did not have jurisdiction for enforcement purposes because the settlement was reached in the grievance process. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, the Commission held that once it determines that it has any jurisdiction over the agreement, it may enforce all provisions of the agreement, even those that do not relate to discrimination issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that appellant sought EEO counseling in July of 1988 concerning several issues, including being harassed, being publicly informed of EAP counseling, having her work hours changed, and being denied the opportunity to meet with her representative prior to an EEO meeting. Some of these same issues were raised at the labor/management meeting of August 15, 1988, and were part of the agreement memorialized in the September 14, 1988 Memorandum of Understanding. Specifically, provisions (6) and (11) of the Memorandum of Understanding address the allegations concerning the EAP counseling incident raised in EEO counseling, and provision (11) addresses retaliation because of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, nowhere does the Memorandum of Understanding specify that it constitutes the settlement of a grievance. Under these circumstances, where an agreement addresses matters raised in EEO counseling, concerns retaliation for EEO activity, and fails to state that it is in settlement of a grievance, such agreement is not within the exclusive domain of the grievance procedure. The Commission therefore has jurisdiction to consider the agreement as it constitutes a settlement, at least in part, of EEO matters. Furthermore, although the EEO matters allegedly settled in the Memorandum of Understanding were not part of a formal EEO complaint, this is not fatal to EEO jurisdiction of the agreement, since an EEO settlement can arise out of the precomplaint process. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bauer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913984 (December 9, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also determine, that contrary to the final agency decision, only provisions (6) and (11) of the settlement agreement are raised in the complaint of October 10, 1988, specifically in allegation (5). Thus, appellant appears to have raised the allegation of the breach of settlement on November 5, 1988, as a separate allegation. Since we have determined that the settlement agreement contains EEO allegations and that the Commission has jurisdiction, the agency has had the obligation to determine whether there has been a breach of settlement with respect to each and every provision of the Memorandum of Understanding. Because the record as it currently exists contains insufficient evidence to make such a determination, and because the agency previously failed to undertake such investigation as required by our previous order, EEOC Appeal No. 01920427, it will be required to do so at this point in time, on remand. Failure of the agency to provide this information through a supplemental investigation may result in the imposition of an adverse inference against the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wendling v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900063 (February 6, 1990) (Commission has the power to draw the inference that evidence, withheld by the agency and within the agency's exclusive control, is unfavorable to the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01922608 (1992). In that case, the complainant's removal was proposed while she had an EEO complaint on other matters pending. The agency and the complainant subsequently entered into a settlement agreement in which the agency withdrew the proposed removal in exchange for the complainant's voluntary resignation. In the same agreement, the complainant also agreed to withdraw her pending EEO complaint. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the settlement agreement was not reached in the context of an EEO proceeding. Instead, the Commission found that "appellant's withdrawal of her EEO complaint was part of the consideration, or detriment suffered by appellant and a benefit to the agency, for which appellant obtained her benefit to the agreement. As such, the agreement constitutes a settlement of her EEO complaint, regardless of what the agency may consider the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Suter v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093523 (2010), holding that the EEOC did not have jurisdiction over provisions of a settlement agreement that related to grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere statement in a grievance settlement agreement that the agreement resolves all of the employee's complaints, including EEO complaints, is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the Commission for enforcement purposes, where there is no evidence that the complainant had ever initiated precomplaint counseling or filed a formal complaint of discrimination, or that any issues resolved by the agreement related to anything other than grievance issues. <span class="Italic">Walton v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01997258 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has shown a reluctance to enforce so-called "last chance" settlements that are popular with the Merit Systems Protection Board where such agreements can be construed as requiring a prospective waiver of EEO rights. The Commission has found that such agreements are not enforceable. See "<a href="0100-2023-14-022.html#sec5-22">Waiver of Rights</a>," above.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not use a subsequent agreement reached in another forum to satisfy its obligations under a previously existing EEO agreement. <span class="Italic">Batton v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01903212 (1990). In that case, the agency settled an EEO complaint by agreeing to give the complainant priority consideration for future vacancies in which he expressed an interest. In the course of being interviewed for a prospective position, the complainant was asked about his union affiliation. As a result, the complainant then filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the Federal Labor Relations Authority. In settlement of that complaint, the agency awarded the complainant a promotion to a new position. The Commission rejected an argument by the agency in <span class="Italic">Batton</span> that the promotion, in accordance with the FLRA settlement, fulfilled its obligations under the EEO settlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency has existing obligations <span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> appellant and the EEO settlement agreement. The paramount obligation is that the agency act in good faith in implementing the letter as well as the spirit of the settlement agreement. The Commission finds that appellant remains entitled to priority consideration for a second position in which he expresses an interest. The agency shall act within the parameters of personnel rules and regulations as well as within the terms of the settlement agreement in affording appellant his...priority consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee of the Postal Service voluntarily settles a grievance, he is not prohibited from seeking additional remedies under Title VII provided that further relief would still be available on his EEO claim. <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933030 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, the EEOC has no authority to enforce settlement agreements reached in MSPB proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Guinn v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 03A20055 (2002) (holding that the Commission had no authority to enforce a settlement agreement reached in a Board case where the validity of the agreement was not affected by the Older Workers' Benefits Protection Act).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the settlement is made in an MSPB case, the employee has the option of seeking specific enforcement through Board procedures. However, the employee also may have the right to proceed with an independent EEO complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Britt v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01961237 (1997), the employee settled a Board appeal in exchange for consideration for promotion. When the employee was nonselected for two promotions, he filed a breach of settlement allegation with the Board. He also filed an EEO complaint charging his nonselections were discriminatory. Because the Board's breach procedures do not resolve allegations of discrimination, the employee was entitled to pursue, independent of the Board's decision, his EEO complaint over the nonselections.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Laber v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01961992 (1997), the Commission determined that the complainant's allegations of breach were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is properly applied in the instant matter for the following reasons: (1) the MSPB decision on February 27, 1996 involved a party to the instant appeal; <span id="Page_433"></span>(2) the issues in the instant matter are in substance the same as those resolved in the MSPB decision on February 27, 1996; (3) controlling facts and legal principles have not changed significantly since the MSPB decision on February 27, 1996; and (4) there are no other special circumstances warranting an exception to the normal rules of preclusion<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 155.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that appellant is collaterally estopped from raising the breach allegations which he raised in his November 13, 1995 letter because such issues have been actually and necessarily determined, in the agency's favor, by the MSPB in its Initial Decision of February 27, 1996. The Commission finds that the agency properly found on March 26, 1996 that appellant's allegations of noncompliance raised in his November 13, 1995 letter were barred.</p>
<p class="noindent">It appears the difference between <span class="Italic">Britt</span> and <span class="Italic">Laber</span> is that in the latter case there was no allegation that the breach itself was discriminatory. The Board's decision served to estop the complainant from pursuing an identical allegation of breach with the Commission. However, in <span class="Italic">Britt</span> the complainant alleged the nonselections were actually discriminatory--an issue that the Board could not address in an enforcement proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the employee seeks enforcement of the settlement agreement before the MSPB, the Commission has no authority to enforce the Board's final order in the case. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972410 (1997). The proper forum for enforcement of a Board order is the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the employee specifically agrees that enforcement will lie with the MSPB, then the Commission has no jurisdiction to determine if the agreement has been breached. In <span class="Italic">Hegedus v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996304 (2001), the Commission found that the complainant elected the Board as a forum and entered into a settlement agreement. Because one of the provisions of the agreement provided for enforcement before the Board, the Commission held that enforcement jurisdiction resided with the Board. The <span class="Italic">Hegedus</span> decision is unclear on whether the Commission was relying solely on the provision to determine that enforcement jurisdiction was with the Board, or on the fact that the agreement had been entered in a Board proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC cannot enforce an agreement reached in another forum if it does not resolve allegations of discrimination. But it does have jurisdiction over a complaint that the agreement is not being complied with on the basis of discrimination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Petitto v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01966508 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. The appellant is an aggrieved employee because he has demonstrated some direct personal loss or harm he suffered with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment. A review of the entire record indicates that the appellant in his formal complaint clearly specified his allegation that he received disparate treatment when the agency did not honor their prior settlement agreement concerning his retention. Even though this prior agreement may not have been entered into in settlement of an EEO complaint, appellant can still file an EEO complaint alleging disparate treatment with regard to the agency's failure to follow through with the terms of the agreement. Thus, while appellant's allegations may not be processed as a breach of settlement agreement under Section 1614.504, it is appropriate to process the complaint under Section 1614.103. Therefore, we find that the agency erred when it found that the complaint did not state a claim because the agreement was falling outside of the complaint process. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim is REVERSED and the matter is REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and the applicable regulations.</p>
