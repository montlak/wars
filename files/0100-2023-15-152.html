<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-150"><span class="space">6.</span> Failure to Produce Witness</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under 29 CFR 1614.109(e), it is the agency's responsibility to arrange for the appearance of approved witnesses who are agency employees. The employee is not required to contact the witness and request his or her attendance. Pursuant to 1614.109(f)(3), an administrative judge may sanction either party for failing to provide a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent">As in many areas, the Commission remains less than clear on the ramifications to an agency when it fails, without good cause, to produce a witness. There are cases holding that when the agency fails to produce such a witness at the hearing, the administrative judge should continue the hearing and require the agency to produce the witness<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Harden v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883826 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, the Commission held that when a critical agency witness who is on sick leave fails to appear for the hearing, the appropriate course is for the administrative judge to postpone the hearing or to arrange for the testimony of the witness on a particular date. The imposition of an adverse inference against the agency was inappropriate where there was no showing of agency bad faith and the witness, because he was on sick leave, was beyond the agency's control. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923237 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission has also imposed an adverse inference as a sanction for failure to produce a witness. When an approved witness within the agency's control fails to appear, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that there was good cause for that failure. In <span class="Italic">Wienecke v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01941659 (1995), the Commission upheld an adverse inference against the agency where the selecting official, who was an approved witness, failed to appear without adequate justification:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we will address the propriety of the adverse inference drawn by the AJ against the agency. Pursuant to 29 CFR Section 1614.109(d), if a party fails "without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es)," an AJ may, in appropriate circumstances, draw an adverse inference that the requested information or testimony would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the information. In this case, having considered the evidence of record, we find that the AJ acted properly in drawing an adverse inference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the SO was aware, approximately two months prior to the hearing, that he was expected to testify. While the agency argues that the SO was only approved with regard to Issue 2, we find that this is a meaningless distinction, since he was still on notice that he was supposed to testify. Furthermore, although the agency emphasizes that it was only given two weeks notice that Issue 1 would be heard with Issue 2, we find that this has nothing to do with the availability of the SO to testify, since the agency acknowledges that, up until the time of the hearing, it was expected that the SO would be able to testify. Therefore, the relevant question is whether the agency has demonstrated that the AFGE negotiations made it impossible for the SO to appear at the hearing on either of the days in question. Our review of the record indicates that, not only has this not been demonstrated, but the agency has not attempted to make such a showing. Although the affidavit submitted by the President-AFGE, is not, by itself, conclusive, it does indicate that the SO could have made time to testify, especially since the negotiations on December 2 do not appear to have lasted the entire day. Furthermore, given the importance of the EEO hearing, coupled with the fact that the SO knew for two months that he was expected to testify, we find that the SO should have made time to testify. In this regard, we note that the AJ made attempts to fit the SO in, either during one of his breaks or his lunch hour, and that he apparently made no effort to appear. While the agency argues that, when the SO learned of the conflict, he offered to testify by teleconference or at a later time, the agency did not specifically identify when this offer was made. Moreover, even if such attempts were made, the AJ apparently believed that, based on the circumstances of this case, the SO should be required to appear at the hearing. This decision was clearly within the AJ's discretion, and the agency has offered insufficient evidence for us to second-guess the AJ on this point. Finally, we note that the AJ raised the possibility of drawing an adverse inference during the first day of the hearing and, for this reason, we find that the agency was provided with adequate notice that such an action might be taken.</p>
<p class="noindent">Obviously, there is a vast difference between a witness who cannot appear because of legitimate illness and one who simply fails to appear for a hearing. In the former case, good cause can be established for the failure of the witness to appear. Probably the best statement of the Commission's position is that, if an agency can establish good cause for its failure to produce the witness the hearing should be rescheduled, or alternative arrangements should be made to take the testimony of that witness. Otherwise, in the absence of good cause, sanctions are appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">To some extent, whether the Commission will impose sanctions for failure to produce a witness depends on the significance of the witness and the nature of the testimony he or she would give. There is a difference between a situation as was presented in <span class="Italic">Wienecke</span> involving a selecting official and that in <span class="Italic">Keene v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04830 (2003), where the complainant merely contended that the agency failed to make an "important witness" available:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, complainant notes that on the first day of the hearing, the agency did not have "an important witness" available. He argues that the agency claimed that the witness was no longer an employee which he states was a lie. The record reveals that the agency was on notice to have complainant's witness, a co-worker, available for the hearing. The agency representative initially stated that the co-worker was no longer with the agency. The representative later corrected himself and informed the AJ and complainant that the co-worker was on maternity leave. The record indicates that both parties attempted to contact the co-worker to no avail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency should have provided such information regarding the availability of a witness prior to the first day of the hearing. The agency is responsible for ensuring that all approved witnesses who are federal employees are notified of the date and time of the hearing. MD-110, at 7-3. Clearly the agency should have been aware that the witness was going to be out on maternity leave prior to the hearing. Had the agency raised the matter to the AJ and complainant, the AJ could have ordered the agency to take steps to obtain testimony from the witness in the form of an affidavit or interrogatory. We note that the AJ, at her discretion, could have delayed the hearing until a time when the witness was available or sanctioned the agency. 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(e) and (f)(3); <span class="Italic">See</span> also MD-110, at 7-9 to 7-10. The agency's failure to provide such information was inappropriate, however complainant has not established that he was harmed. Complainant summarily argues that she would have proven his case. He does not provide any information as to what evidence the co-worker would have provided in support of his claims of discrimination. Therefore, we conclude that complainant has not shown how the omission of the witness hampered his case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Wienecke</span>, the Commission imposed attorney fees as a sanction where the agency's failure to produce a witness resulted in delay of the hearing. In <span class="Italic">Salem v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976674 (1999), because of an inability to secure babysitting, an agency witness could not attend the scheduled hearing unless she could bring her children. The hearing was rescheduled at a time when the witness could attend and the agency representative was advised the witness could bring her children. Although the agency representative informed the witness of the change in hearing date and time, he did not advise the witness that she could bring her children and, therefore, she did not appear. The Commission rejected an argument that the agency believed complainant's representative, who sought to call the witness, would inform her she could bring her children and imposed attorney fees against the agency as a sanction for the time spent waiting for the witness to get to the hearing. In <span class="Italic">Salem</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a preliminary matter, we note that an AJ has broad discretion in the conduct of a hearing, and that pursuant to 64 Fed. Reg. 37,644, 37,657 (to be codified and hereinafter referred to as 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e)(3)(v)), an award of sanctions in the form of attorney's fees and costs is a remedy available to an AJ<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Stull v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942827 (June 15, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circumstances relating to the imposition of sanctions are as follows: upon learning that W-1 could not attend the hearing to be held at the agency because she could not bring her children and did not have a baby sitter available, the AJ changed the location to the EEO District office and the date from July 18 to July 22, 1996, so W-1 could bring her children. The agency representative was so informed but simply had the agency notify W-1 of the new date and location of the hearing, assuming that complainant's counsel would inform W-1 that she could bring her children to the hearing. When W-1 did not appear at the hearing, however, this caused the hearing to be delayed for one and a half hours. Consequently, the AJ imposed, as a sanction on the agency, attorney's fees for the time wasted by complainant's attorney owing to W-1's nonappearance. Although the agency contended that its only responsibility was to notify <span id="Page_525"></span>W-1 of the new date and time of the hearing, which it did, the AJ imposed the sanctions because she had stressed to the agency representative on July 18, 1996, the agency obligation to provide for W-1's attendance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that under 64 Fed. Reg. 37,644, 37657 (1999) (to be codified and hereinafter referred to as 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e)), the regulations state only that "[a]gencies shall provide for the attendance at a hearing of all employees approved as witnesses by an administrative judge" (italics added). Where, as here, an approved witness within the agency's control fails to appear, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that there was good cause for the failure<span class="Italic">. Wienecke v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, SSA, EEOC Appeal No. 01941659 (May 2, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency representative testified that she did not tell W-1 that she could bring her children as she believed "in good faith" that complainant's attorney, who had initiated the request to change the location of the hearing, "would tell her own witness that she could bring the children." The Commission finds, however, that this reason does not suffice as "good cause" for the failure of W-1 to appear under <span class="Italic">Wienecke, supra</span>, in light of the fact that the AJ had stressed to the agency representative the agency obligation to provide for W-1's attendance, and the agency representative knew that W-1 would not appear unless she was told that she could bring her children to the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that it is responsible only for making its employees, and not their children, available to testify at a hearing. In support of this contention, we note that the above regulation applies only to agency employees and not to their dependents. Yet we further note that EEOC Management Directive (MD)110, as revised, November 9, 1999, also states that the agency responsibility at the hearing stage includes not only "ensuring the appearance" but also the "travel arrangements to the hearing site of approved witnesses who are federal employees" (Ch. 7, II, B, 7-3) (italics added). In this regard, we find that the agency representative knew that W-1 would not appear at the hearing unless she could bring her children as part of the travel arrangements, and that the AJ had stressed to the agency representative the agency obligation to provide for W-1's attendance, which would necessarily entail providing for the attendance of W-1's children as well, when W-1 could not procure a babysitter. Therefore, we determine that the AJ did not exceed her authority in imposing sanctions upon the agency when W-1 failed to appear, since it was the agency's responsibility, and not that of complainant's counsel, to ensure W-1's attendance at the hearing by informing her that she could bring her children.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, an administrative judge does not abuse his discretion when he denies an agency request to reconvene a hearing to take additional testimony when the agency fails to produce two previously approved witnesses. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981174 (1999), the Commission upheld not only the denial of the request to reconvene the hearing, but an adverse inference against the agency for failing to produce two selection committee members. In upholding the rulings, the Commission noted the agency did not advise the judge that the witnesses would not appear until the day of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the Commission's administrative judges do not have subpoena power, this can lead to problems in the production of critical witnesses. This is particularly true in the case of former agency employees. In <span class="Italic">Comer v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01912386 (1991), the Commission found that the administrative judge had erred in not allowing hearsay testimony on the agency's proffered legitimate reasons for not selecting the complainant in a case where the selecting official had retired and refused to voluntarily appear at the hearing. Noting that it does not, in any event, strictly apply the rules of evidence with respect to hearsay, the Commission found the excluded testimony was necessary in evaluating the legitimacy of the agency's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not entirely relieved of its responsibility to produce a witness because the witness no longer works for the agency. In <span class="Italic">Crummer v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01913933 (1992), the Commission upheld the use of an adverse inference against the agency by its administrative judge where the agency delayed in notifying the complainant's counsel of the retirement of an approved witness and, thereafter, refused to provide the address or telephone number of the witness to complainant's counsel or the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a witness who has given an affidavit in the investigation fails to appear and testify at the hearing, a party can request that the administrative judge strike the affidavit from the report of investigation as a sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is improper for the administrative judge to let all of a complainant's testimony stand as unrebutted simply because the agency no longer has control over former employees. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932323 (1993). The Commission accepted the agency's contention that such a ruling gives a complainant "'a wide range to say anything, whether true or not, simply because there were no witnesses to rebut his testimony.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission held that to the extent the appellant's testimony related to matters raised in his affidavit, the agency could rebut such testimony through other affidavits obtained in the investigative process. To the extent the appellant raised new matters in his testimony, the Commission held it would assess that testimony as part of the overall record in the case. "The Commission will not automatically accept appellant's testimony on new matters as preponderant evidence simply because the agency was unable" to produce witnesses no longer within its control. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Education</span>, 05950147 (1996), the Commission found it was improper for the administrative judge to draw an adverse inference from the failure of a second-level supervisor to appear at the hearing where the supervisor no longer worked for the agency. The Commission reasoned in <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> "the Supervisor's failure to attend the hearing cannot be deemed to be a refusal by the agency to submit evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In order to raise the failure of an agency to produce a witness or disclose the location of the witness on appeal, the complainant must seek an order from the administrative judge requiring the agency to produce the witness or disclose his location. <span class="Italic">Knapp-Huffman v. Attorney General</span>, 01991026 (2002).</p>
