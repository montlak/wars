<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-65"><span class="space">2.</span> Failure to Produce or Destruction of Documents</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jew v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120073047 (2009), the administrative judge imposed a sanction of an adverse inference when the agency destroyed the applications of candidates for a selection. The judge inferred that the applications would have shown that the complainant was better qualified than the selectees. However, the Commission found that the sanction did not preclude the agency from demonstrating the legitimacy of its selections where it presented evidence that the selections were based on interview performance and the desire to hire an outside candidate. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jew</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, assuming complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the alleged bases, the agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. Specifically, as to the first vacancy announcement, complainant was the first candidate on OPM's Certificate. In September of 1996, the agency interviewed all candidates, including complainant. The interview panel interviewed, rated, and ranked all ten (10) candidates. The agency offered the EEM position to two individuals, not in complainant's protected groups, both of whom ultimately declined to accept the position. SO1 stated that because she and the other two panelists spent a great deal of time developing standard interview questions for the candidates, they "very much relied on those [resulting] point scores." The agency indicated that complainant was ranked 8th based on his interview. An interviewer testified (upon reviewing his notes which are contained in the record) that complainant's responses during the interview were not as "focused" as he had expected or wanted. The same interviewer further explained why complainant was not selected, as follows: A recent EEO Report (which grew out of an EEO Task Force on which the interviewer served) evaluating the agency's EEO program, concluded that the agency's EEO program was deficient in meeting proposed objectives. Consequently, while he believed complainant certainly had broad EEO experience, he was still a part of the old regime, and felt that the office would best be served by hiring someone from the outside as opposed to someone from the inside. The record reveals that in contrast to complainant who already worked for the agency's EEO office, at the time of selection, S1 was employed with the Executive Office of the President, and S2 was employed with the National Archives. Therefore, even drawing the adverse inference that complainant's application, if produced, would have reflected that complainant was more qualified than S1 or S2, the agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, and this record does not indicate by a preponderance of the evidence, that complainant was not selected because of his membership in a protected group.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission was more forgiving of the agency's failure to preserve notes from the selection process in <span class="Italic">Jaleesa P. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120172110 (2018), where witness testimony filled in the evidentiary gap. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jalessa P</span>., upheld the administrative judge's sanction that the agency could not use the affidavits provided by the panelists in support of its motion for summary judgment, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the Human Resources office was undergoing reorganization at the time and the notes were destroyed by staff who were not included on the request to preserve the case file. That, together with the fact that the destruction of the interview notes was a routine practice at the Agency, tends to negate any inference that the Agency destroyed the notes in anticipation of Complainant's filing an EEO complaint. Moreover, by requiring a hearing on the claim, the testimony provided by ten witnesses, including the Panelists and Complainant, filled in the evidentiary gap created by the destruction of the notes. Aside from her own assertions, Complainant has not presented affidavits, declarations, or statements from witnesses other than herself or any documentary evidence that contradicts the Agency's explanation as to why the notes were destroyed, or undermines the Agency's veracity to the reasons for the selection decision at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Helen G. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120150182 (2017), upheld an administrative judge's refusal to impose sanctions against the agency for the selecting officials' failure to retain interview notes in a nonselection case. The administrative judge's analysis in <span class="Italic">Helen G</span>. is instructive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ held a hearing on August 4, 2014. Prior to the conclusion of the hearing, the AJ declined to sanction the Agency for failing to retain the interview notes. Although Complainant had requested a sanction, the AJ found that a sanction was not appropriate for the following reasons: (1) the selecting officials were operating from a good faith belief that the interview notes did not have to be retained; (2) the Agency was taking steps to ensure the preservation of such records in the future; and (3) the prejudice to Complainant was small because the selecting officials drafted contemporaneous justification memoranda memorializing what they relied upon at the time of the selections and because the selecting officials were subject to full cross-examination about the interview process, the interview questions, and the comparable qualifications of the applicants. The AJ concluded that there was no evidence suggesting that the interview notes contained information adverse to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion by not sanctioning the Agency for failing to retain the interview notes. We agree with the <span id="Page_591"></span>AJ's detailed explanation as described above about why a sanction was not warranted in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Miguelina S. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720160012 (2018), the administrative judge found that the complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the bases of sex, age, and disability with regard to her constructive discharge claim and was entitled to personal relief. As a sanction for complainant's failure to attend an agency deposition and respond to discovery, however, the administrative judge rescinded the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> finding and limited the complainant's remedies to compensatory damages and attorney fees. Both parties appealed, and the Commission in <span class="Italic">Miguelina S</span>. reversed the administrative judge's sanction limiting the complainant's damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant essentially argues that she should not have been sanctioned because she made a good faith effort to comply with the Agency's discovery request by filing an objection to the scope and nature of the Agency discovery requests; she established good cause for a temporary delay in the discovery proceedings; and the AJ improperly found that the Agency had the right to conduct the deposition on damages despite its failure to timely complete the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant filed an objection to the Agency's interrogatory and document request and opposed the Agency's Motion to Compel. In these filings, Complainant mainly objected to the scope and relevance of several interrogatories and documents. On July 1, 2014, the AJ issued a Ruling and Order that addressed Complainant's objections to the Agency's discovery requests, which resulted in the AJ narrowing the scope of the requested information and ordering Complainant to respond to the discovery requests within 10 days. Complainant did not respond to the Agency's discovery requests, despite being served with them on June 6, 2014. Additionally, Complainant did not appear at a scheduled deposition on July 24, 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we first find that there is no evidence that the AJ abused his discretion with respect to his rulings on discovery. In fact, the record reflects that the AJ appropriately narrowed the scope of discovery so that the Agency's requests were reasonable and relevant to the determination of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After narrowing the scope of discovery, the AJ ordered Complainant to respond to the Agency's discovery requests. Complainant did not provide the discovery responses as ordered. Additionally, Complainant did not attend a scheduled deposition. We note that the AJ's December 3, 2012, Acknowledgement and Order warned the parties that failure to abide by an AJ's order may result in sanctions. Further, the AJ's May 30, 2014, Hearing Order on Damages provided that Complainant must attend the Agency's deposition. As explained above, the AJ gave Complainant the option of several sites for the deposition. Therefore, we reject Complainant's claim that she could not attend the deposition at one particular site.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"> We determine that Complainant has not provided adequate justification for willfully violating the AJ's order with respect to discovery. Under these particular circumstances, we do not find that the AJ abused his discretion when he canceled the damages hearing as a sanction for Complainant's conduct. However, we determine that the AJ's initial finding that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discriminatory constructive discharge was the proper legal conclusion based on the evidence in this case. As such, we find that it was inappropriate for the AJ to rescind this legal finding as a sanction against Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the AJ appropriately entered default judgment in favor of Complainant, and Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination for her constructive discharge claim, she is entitled to personal relief, including equitable remedies. Thus, Complainant is entitled to reinstatement to her position, back pay and benefits, compensatory damages, and attorney's fees and costs associated with her constructive discharge claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In early case law, the Commission held that the mere destruction of evidence, without more, does not justify the drawing of an adverse inference. In <span class="Italic">Worsley v. Attorney General</span>, 05920803 (1993), the complainant argued the administrative judge should have drawn an adverse inference over the failure of the agency to produce tape recordings of interviews with witnesses taken by the EEO investigator. The tape recordings in <span class="Italic">Worsley</span> had been destroyed by the investigator prior to the complainant's request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t appears that appellant believes that if the audio tapes of interviews were destroyed contrary to common practice, that is enough to warrant an adverse inference. Whether there was an agency-wide common practice at all is an open question, since unlike the referenced EEO Counselors, the investigator in this case, according to the agency, routinely reused tapes after transcribing taped interviews into affidavit form. However, more than mere destruction is needed before the adverse inference rule is properly applied. The adverse inference rule provides that when a party has relevant evidence within his or her control and fails to produce it, that failure gives rise to an inference that the evidence is unfavorable to the party. <span class="Italic">International Union (UAW) v. NLRB</span>, 459 F.2d 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1972). The Commission has adopted the rule in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the administrative appeal process. <span class="Italic">Diane C. Wendling v. Department of Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900063 (February 6, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rule is generally viewed as a permissive one, which may be applied at the discretion of the fact finder. <span class="Italic">Wilcox v. Kerr-McGee Corporation</span>, 706 F. Supp. 1258 (E.D. La. 1989). "These inferences, to be sure, cannot fairly be made except upon certain conditions; and they are also always open to explanation by circumstances which make some other hypothesis a more natural one than the party's fear of exposure." 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence 5285 (Chadbourn rev. 1979). Here, the AJ noted that the evidence sought was already available in the form of affidavits. We note that all affidavits were signed by the affiants, thus attesting to the accuracy of the transcription from tapes, except for the affidavit of one official who testified at the hearing. Clearly, under those circumstances the AJ did not consider the audio tapes to be relevant evidence. We agree with the previous decision in finding that the AJ's refusal to draw an adverse inference was a proper exercise of his authority. Accordingly, Exhibit 36 does not warrant a reopening of the previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, as noted below, the Commission now adheres to the view that a demonstration of bad faith in destroying records is not required to impose sanctions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will apparently infer bad faith where the agency destroys selection records after it is on notice that a complaint has been filed. In <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01933987 (1994), the Commission held that, in such circumstances, the agency has an "absolute duty" to preserve the records and that an adverse inference will be drawn unless the agency introduces evidence that it was acting in "good faith" in destroying the records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal regulations require a federal agency to maintain all records relevant to an EEO complaint until after final resolution of that complaint. General Services Administration, Federal Property Management Regulations, 101.11.4, General Records Schedule I, Item 26. Our regulations parallel that requirement. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1602.14(a) makes it clear that in the case of a contested selection decision, the agency shall maintain all pertinent information regarding the employment decision. In this case, the agency has failed to meet its duty to maintain or provide information crucial to this case. The evidence contained in the record is insufficient for purposes of allowing appellant a full and fair opportunity to establish his case of discrimination or to show pretext on the part of the agency. While the agency guidelines may have permitted destruction of the information, the record established that all of the selection packages were purged after appellant had filed his formal complaint of discrimination. Since the agency had prior notice that appellant had filed a complaint and since the destroyed records were highly relevant to the matters raised in the complaint, we find that the agency had an absolute duty to preserve the records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to either retain the necessary record or reconstruct the record. The Commission further finds that the agency's conduct made it impossible for appellant to establish his case of discrimination based on race and to show pretext. This failure compels the application of an adverse inference that if the relevant information had been provided it would have been favorable to the appellant and unfavorable to the agency<span class="Italic">. See Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">In the Matter of the Request to Reopen by Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No., 05860212 (May 26, 1987). To do otherwise would encourage federal agencies to purge records related to EEO complaints which they are legally obligated to maintain and provide to this Commission upon request. It is a widely accepted rule that when a party has relevant information within its control which it fails to properly produce, that failure to produce such evidence gives rise to the inference that the evidence is in fact unfavorable<span class="Italic">. International Union (UAW) v. NLRB</span>, 459 F.2d 1329, 1335 (D.C. Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The adverse inference rule is also used generally by the Commission to avoid unnecessary delays in the administrative appeal process, which occur when discovery orders or evidentiary requests are ignored<span class="Italic">. Diane C. Wendling v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900063 (February 6, 1990). When such bad faith conduct occurs, we have not hesitated to employ this rule accordingly<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Charlotte E. Grimes v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900374 (July 16, 1990); <span class="Italic">Joseph I. Sellman v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890993 (December 14, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the facts of this case as outlined in the background and in numerations above clearly warrant invoking this rule. Further, the agency has failed to proffer any arguments establishing that its failure to provide such information upon request results from a good faith misinterpretation of their duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the above, we find that the agency's failure to preserve the records made it impossible for appellant to establish his case of discrimination based on race and to show pretext. Since this failure compels the application of the adverse inference rule, the Commission finds that if the relevant information had been provided it would have <span id="Page_592"></span>been favorable to the appellant and unfavorable to the agency. Thus, appellant satisfies his burden in establishing that the agency's actions were based on his race and in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Commission notes that appellant was denied selection to specific positions (Lithographic Worker, WG-7, WG-9, WG-10 and WG-11) sought in 1988. However, the agency's failure to preserve the records makes it impossible to determine the appropriate wage grade level to place appellant. Thus, the Commission orders the agency to have a Personnel Staffing Specialist review appellant's qualifications and rank appellant on each wage grade level in the Lithographic Worker series from WG-7 to WG-11.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">King v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940441 (1995), the Commission upheld an adverse inference imposed by the administrative judge where the agency's policy of destroying certain selection documents was deemed to prevent any meaningful inquiries into discrimination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">King</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the previous decision's finding that it was proper for the AJ to draw an adverse inference, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3)(i), that information requested but not produced by the agency would have been unfavorable to the agency. We agree with the AJ that the agency did not show good cause for its failure to produce the requested information. The AJ properly observed that the agency's express policy of requiring the destruction of documents that go to the heart of the rating procedure for Initial-Level Supervisor Candidacy, including CEB worksheets, if permitted to continue, would frustrate the purposes of Title VII by keeping facts from coming to light as to how candidates in a particular group were rated by a particular CEB. The agency also failed to provide sufficient justification for its failure to maintain other clearly relevant documents, including the applications of the other applicants<span class="Italic">. See Rogelio Ramirez v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920839 (March 4, 1993) (adverse inference appropriate where agency failed to ensure that relevant interview records were retained and may even have been instrumental in ensuring that some of the relevant records were destroyed). Because the agency did not show good cause for its failure to produce the requested information, we draw the adverse inference that the requested information, if disclosed, would have revealed that the CEB treated appellant's application less favorably than it treated similar applications of others who had not filed EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cottrell v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05991163 (2002) (a sanction of adverse inference was appropriate where the agency destroyed selection documents).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sewell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A30006 (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 05200701141 (2007), the Commission upheld an adverse inference against the agency that resulted in summary judgment where the agency destroyed the merit promotion file after the EEO complaint was filed and also was unable to produce the official personnel file of the successful candidate. The Commission specifically noted that once an EEO complaint is filed, the agency is required to retain all relevant records. Thus, the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in drawing an adverse inference against the agency's articulated reason for the selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">EEOC administrative judges have wide discretion in conducting hearings and that extends to conducting hearings on whether a sanction is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090010 (2010). As with other factual findings of an administrative judge based on hearing testimony, the Commission will defer to the factual findings made by a judge after a sanction hearing and overturn them only if the evidence is such that "a reasonable person could not come to the same conclusion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, the judge held a hearing on the existence of a logbook that purportedly memorialized employee work assignments. After hearing the evidence and making credibility findings about agency witnesses, the judge concluded the logbook had existed and imposed an adverse inference that the logbook would have shown disparate treatment in work assignments of the complainant and coworkers. Apparently, not content to leave well enough alone, the agency argued that even if the logbook existed, it would have been destroyed prior to the complainant's request for it in compliance with agency record retention policies. The judge ordered the agency to produce the policies and when it failed to do so, imposed a second adverse inference that the policies would have reflected unfavorably upon the agency if they had been produced.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that AJ-1's ruling that a logbook showing complainant's daily assignments even existed was contrary to the weight of the evidence. We note, however, that AJ-1 made a finding regarding the existence of the logbook after holding an in-person hearing, at which time he was able to observe the witnesses' testimony and make findings on their relative credibility. Post-hearing factual findings are subject to a substantial evidence standard. We find that the agency has not shown that AJ-1's finding regarding the existence of the logbook was so clearly in opposition to the evidence before him that a reasonable person could not have come to the same conclusion. An AJ's findings on credibility are also given great weight on review. Therefore, we decline to reverse AJ-1 on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ-1 drew an adverse inference from the agency's refusal/inability to produce the logbook which would have shown complainant's daily assignments, in comparison with those of the other screeners. The agency claims that because it was not truly on notice that discriminatory work assignments were part of complainant's claim, and were not part of the accepted claim, it should not be penalized for the destruction of those records. We find it somewhat inexplicable that an agency would destroy records of employee work assignments on a daily, or even monthly, basis, given that the regulations found at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) give a complainant 45 days from the date of the discriminatory event to contact an EEO Counselor. Even monthly destruction would not comport with the agency responsibility to produce documents related to any complainant's claim, even one filed within 45 days and accepted a in manner which would put the agency immediately on notice that those documents were required. Although the agency argues here that because AJ-1 did not redefine the claim until February 2006, it was not able to produce the relevant records, we note that under the policies it asserts were in effect, it would not have been able to produce the records at any time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations afford broad authority for the conduct of hearings by Administrative Judges. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.; <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 17, 2001). When a complainant or agency fails to comply with an AJ's order, an AJ may take action against the noncomplying party pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), up to and including issuing a decision in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3)(iv). Sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). A sanction may be used to deter the noncomplying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that AJ-1's issuance of a sanction in the form of an adverse inference was not an abuse of discretion, and was narrowly tailored to the agency's action. We also find that this ruling serves to put the agency on notice that similar conduct in the future will be unacceptable with respect to other employees' complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ-1 also ruled that the agency failed to comply with his Order to produce its records management and retention policies, and failed to show good cause as to why it did not do so. We find that the adverse inference drawn from the non-production of those records retention policies was also within the AJ's discretion. AJ-1, in response to the agency's assertion that the logbook records had been destroyed, gave the agency an opportunity to establish that it had lawfully destroyed those records in accordance with agency records retention policies. The agency did not comply with AJ-1's Order to produce those policies. Therefore, we find it reasonable that AJ-1 drew an adverse inference that the records retention policies would have reflected unfavorably on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The rule that bad faith is not a required showing for an imposition of sanctions, however, does not guarantee the imposition of sanctions when documents are destroyed. In <span class="Italic">Stenken v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120055305 (2007), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in failing to impose sanctions where the complaint file was destroyed pursuant to a retention schedule. The case, which has a lengthy procedural history that is not fully explained, apparently spent several years at OFO during which time the complaint file was destroyed by the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stenken</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we address the matter of sanctions. Complainant contends that sanctions are warranted based on the numerous excessive (and unexplained) agency delays which are documented in the record, and she contends that the AJ should have imposed them against the agency. Complainant asks the Commission to impose sanctions and draw adverse inferences against the agency at this juncture. First, we discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the AJ. Administrative Judges have broad discretion in the conduct of hearings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e); Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110) at 7-8 to 7-14 (revised November 9, 1999); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980746 (September 19, 2000). In so finding, we note that it appears that much of the reason for the delay in the processing of this case was that on June 25, 2002, when the Commission remanded the claims herein to the agency for further processing, the agency had already purged the file, and the file subsequently had to be reconstructed. Complainant notes, but does not specifically dispute, that the file was purged because the regulatory retention period had expired. Although the agency ought to have more immediately notified the Commission that the file in this case was purged, we decline to find that the AJ's failure to issue sanctions, constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120120882 (2014), where the destruction of emails was the result of a <span id="Page_593"></span>catastrophic failure of a computer hard drive, some emails had been printed out and retained by the supervisor and the emails were tangential to the issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that the AJ failed to rule on his motion to compel the Agency to produce SI's computer hard drive or to sanction the Agency for failing to retain this evidence. . .. We note that this is not a case wherein the Agency destroyed evidence. Instead, it is a case where the hard drive containing the evidence unexpectedly and catastrophically failed. Contrary to Complainant's assertions, we do not find that the Agency was derelict in its duties to preserve evidence just because it did not print out or make electronic backup copies of all the e-mail before the hard drive failed. Further, we note that the record contains some of the email because Si printed out e-mail that she thought were relevant to this case before the hard drive failed. Additionally, much testimony was elicited during the hearing that covered the subject matter of the missing e-mail. Finally, we note that the missing e-mail purportedly concerned the approval of C2's VLTP application, not Complainant's suspension. While the approval of C2's application has some tangential relevance to Complainant's complaint, it is not the core matter at issue in this case. As such, we do not find that Complainant is prejudiced or otherwise unfairly disadvantaged because the Agency cannot produce every email about C2's VLTP application. Therefore, we find that the AJ's failure to rule on Complainant's motion to compel was harmless error.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720140033 (2014), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to impose sanctions for the destruction of interview notes, but did order training for management officials on document retention:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the interviewees' notes were written records of past events that were at issue in this nonselection case, and because the interviewees' notes were within the Agency's control, we find that these notes constitute "records pertaining to the failure or refusal to hire" under the ADEA's recordkeeping requirements, records that the Agency should have preserved. Therefore, we determine that the AJ did not err in his ultimate conclusion that the Agency violated the EEOC's recordkeeping requirements by destroying the interviewees' notes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . ..</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in declining to draw an adverse inference against the Agency for failing to preserve Complainant's interview notes. Complainant has not given us reason to believe that the notes would show that she answered the hypothetical questions in a manner that would contradict the interviewers' accounts. What one takes down in notes does not necessarily reveal the manner in which one verbally answered the interview questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we determine that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in ordering the Agency to communicate with and train all of its managers and supervisors, who participate in selections, to retain all interview notes.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120123333 (2014), the Commission determined that the administrative judge did not err in failing to impose an adverse inference as a sanction for the destruction of documents but did find a sanction of failing to consider the testimony of two agency witnesses was appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we agree with the AJ's denial of an adverse inference, we nonetheless find that a sanction is appropriate in this case. Agencies have a duty to maintain pertinent evidence once a complainant has initiated the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Ponce v. Agency for Int'l Dev</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120131173 (June 24, 2013) (29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14 "requires that once the complaint process is initiated, the agency is required to retain personnel records until a final disposition of the complaint"); <span class="Italic">Cosentine v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A40114 (Aug. 9, 2006) (same). Complainant contacted an EEO Counselor on May 2, 2007, and the Agency should have preserved all documentation relevant to Complainant's complaint. Although the record in this case does not indicate that the Agency acted in bad faith, the Commission's regulations do not require a finding of willfulness or bad faith as a prerequisite to the issuance of a sanction. <span class="Italic">Cosentine v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>. Because the Agency failed to maintain S2's and S3's copies of the potential-transfer list and any notes that they may have written, we find it appropriate to sanction the Agency by not considering the testimony of S2 and S3 regarding the meeting at which they and S4 discussed the selection of transferees. This sanction, which provides an equitable remedy for Complainant's inability to review the missing documents, should deter the Agency from destroying documents in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has firmly rejected the notion that a showing of bad faith is required to sanction an agency for the failure to produce relevant documents. In <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 07A40003 (2005), the Commission upheld a sanction that resulted in the agency losing the case even though there was no showing of bad faith. The Commission, in King, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record reveals that complainant requested that the agency preserve the interview notes that were generated during her interview for the Hub Manager position. Despite this request, the agency failed to preserve the notes or produce them during discovery. In response, the AJ issued a notice to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. Having found that the agency failed to show cause, the AJ issued an adverse inference sanction against the agency for its only articulated reason for complainant's non-selection. As such, the AJ issued a finding of discrimination in light of the agency's failure to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Indeed, the agency stipulated that the only legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that complainant was not selected was due to poor interview performance. There was no way for complainant to prove that the reason was pretext without the interview notes documenting such alleged poor performances. Accordingly, the AJ issued a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency maintains that it was only negligent in losing the interview notes, and therefore, it should not be subjected to such a sanction. However, we note that a showing that the noncomplying party acted in bad faith is not required. <span class="Italic">See Cornell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (November 24, 1998). We find no abuse of discretion on the AJ's part. Furthermore, as noted above, sanctions may be used not only to equitably remedy the opposing party, but also to deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future. <span class="Italic">See Hale, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">That an adverse inference against the agency is appropriate does not answer the question as to what that inference should be. The administrative judge is required to tailor the sanction to the particular violation. In <span class="Italic">Cosentine v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A40114 (2006), the Commission found that the administrative judge properly sanctioned the agency for destruction of a selection matrix that contained an assessment of the candidates. However, the Commission found that the judge abused his discretion in determining that the appropriate inference to draw was that the complainant was better qualified than the selectee. That inference had led the judge to find discrimination in the selection even though he also found that the complainant had failed to demonstrate a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> on any basis in her claim that she was discriminatorily denied an interview for the position. The appropriate inference for the judge to have drawn, according to the Commission, was that the missing information would have reflected unfavorably on the agency. That inference, when evaluated with other evidence in the case, was not sufficient to sustain a finding of pretext. Note that while a finding of bad faith is not required to issue a sanction, lack of bad faith is a factor that goes to the precise sanction that should be imposed.</p>
<p class="noindent">An adverse inference is not appropriate based on the destruction of the complainant's draft work products, where the agency does not routinely preserve such documents and the destruction occurred before the filing of the complaint. <span class="Italic">Tenorio v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01931519 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960691 (1998), the Commission found the judge erred in failing to impose an adverse inference on the agency where it refused to produce "critical records in its custody." The Commission found that such a refusal "substantially prejudice[s]" a complainant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Sanders</span>, the agency refused to produce time and attendance records for comparable employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mathes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00093 (2001), the Commission found that an adverse inference that effectively resulted in a finding of discrimination was appropriate where the agency refused to provide a document to the complainant's counsel describing the selection procedures used by the agency. In <span class="Italic">Mathes</span>, the agency contended the document contained confidential information about the agency's selection process that could impact on future selections if released. The agency provided a copy of the document to the judge for <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review, but refused to provide a copy to the complainant after the judge ruled there was nothing in the document that would preclude its disclosure. In upholding the sanctions in <span class="Italic">Mathes</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During discovery, complainant filed a motion to compel the production of Document 601.5, and the Administrative Judge ordered the agency to comply. The agency refused to provide the document because of its "confidential" nature. As a result, the Administrative Judge ordered the agency to provide Document 601.5 for her <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review. The Administrative Judge indicated that if, upon review of the "restricted" document, she believed a closed supplemental hearing was warranted, she would conduct one. After reviewing Document 601.5, the Administrative Judge determined that a closed supplemental hearing was not warranted and that nothing in Document 601.5 was of a nature that would justify excluding it from an administrative hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge. Accordingly, the Administrative Judge ordered the agency to provide complainant with a copy of Document 601.5; informed the agency that its failure to do so might result in an adverse inference that the document was contrary to the agency's interest and that the agency would not be entitled to introduce into evidence any favorable testimony pertaining to the contents of Document 601.5; and that the agency's failure to comply might also result in a default judgment against the agency. When the agency did not comply, the Administrative Judge issued an order informing the parties that she would issue a default judgment against the agency and scheduling a hearing limited to the issue of complainant's entitlement to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_594"></span>In its final decision, the agency argues that the Administrative Judge's sanction was too harsh since the agency had not completely disregarded the Administrative Judge's order, insofar as it had agreed to allow her to review Document 601.5 <span class="Italic">in camera</span> and had agreed to a closed supplemental hearing. The agency also rejected the $1,500.00 non-pecuniary compensatory damage award, finding that complainant did not prove discrimination. However, the final decision did not include any legal analysis in support of its conclusion that complainant did not prove discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record, the Commission concludes that the Administrative Judge did not abuse her discretion. In reaching this conclusion, we note that an Administrative Judge has the authority to sanction a party, who fails, without good cause, to respond fully and in a timely fashion to an Administrative Judge's order. 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3). The Administrative Judge did not find that the agency had good cause for refusing to provide complainant with a copy of Document 601.5. The agency argued that Document 601.5 contained confidential selection material that, if revealed, would compromise the future integrity of the selection process for the Associate Supervisor Program. The Administrative Judge reviewed the Associate Supervisor Review Committee Guidelines and determined that they were no different from any other selection guidelines, criteria, or benchmarks used for the selection of supervisory positions, and that the agency's concern about their disclosure was adequately addressed by the Administrative Judge's order requiring Document 601.5 only to be disclosed to the parties to the instant action and requiring copies not be distributed to anyone other than complainant's counsel. We note that the agency has proffered no evidence, beyond its mere assertion, concerning the highly confidential nature of Document 601.5, and as a result we discern no basis to disturb the Administrative Judge's determination that the agency failed to show good cause for not complying with her discovery order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge found that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination insofar as he was found qualified for the Associate Supervisor Program and individuals outside of his protected classes were selected. The Administrative Judge found that complainant's rights under 29 CFR Part 1614 were significantly affected because without Document 601.5, which contained evidence regarding the selection processes and critical criteria, he could not effectively challenge his non-selection. By withholding Document 601.5, the agency deprived complainant of a full and fair opportunity to present his case and meet his burden of proof. As such, it was not an abuse of discretion for the Administrative Judge to conclude, as an adverse inference, that had the agency produced Document 601.5, complainant would have been able to establish that the agency's explanation for its selection was a pretext for discrimination. 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent"> In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956109 (1998), the Commission drew an adverse inference from the agency's failure to provide a copy of the complainant's submission in support of compensatory damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the facts of this case, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $7,500.00. In reaching this amount, the Commission has considered a number of factors. For example we considered the nature and severity of the discrimination, as well as the nature and severity of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms. We considered the scant amount of evidence concerning appellant's emotional distress, including appellant's brief testimony and the conclusory statements from appellant's physician that he was treating appellant for stress related to his job. However, we have also considered the agency's failure to provide us with a copy of appellant's June 9, 1995 submission in support of his claim for compensatory damages and are drawing an adverse inference that this information would have reflected unfavorably on the agency and provided further support for appellant's claim of emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3). Finally, we considered the amounts awarded in similar cases. Based on all of these considerations, we find that $7,500.00 is a proper award for the emotional distress which appellant has suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the Commission's award of damages in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> was not based entirely on the adverse inference but on other evidence as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure of an agency to make arrangements for the hearing, appear at the hearing, or present evidence warrants sanctions. In <span class="Italic">Viramontes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980929 (1998), the agency simply refused to participate in the hearing process at all after the administrative judge denied its motion for a continuance. The administrative judge drew an adverse inference that the complainant would have established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination had the hearing been held. Because the agency presented no evidence to rebut the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the judge concluded that the agency discriminated against the complainant. The Commission upheld the sanctions on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0720130003 (2014), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not err in imposing adverse inferences due to the failure to preserve interview notes and records establishing the protected bases of candidates referred for a second interview:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the AJ, the sanctions were imposed due to the Agency's failure to preserve interview notes and inability to identify who was granted a second interview but not selected. His first adverse inference was that the destroyed interview notes would have reflected unfavorably on the Agency (i.e. that Complainant did well and no other applicant gave a better interview). The AJ initially considered making solely the inference that Complainant had done well in the interview. However, the AJ ultimately determined that the Agency's failure to preserve interview notes had "prejudiced Complainant's case to a far greater extent that just proving she gave a good interview." The next adverse inference was that Manager T interviewed and referred, for a second interview, individuals outside of Complainant's protected bases (race and age). The AJ noted that thereafter, the [Complainant] provided evidence that Manager T had in fact participated in the first-level interviews of two white selectees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ's sanctions, the adverse inferences, were appropriately tailored to the Agency's destruction of interview notes. The Agency argues on appeal that since it attempted to locate the notes and did not contest that Complainant gave a good interview, it should not have been sanctioned. According the Agency, Complainant's interview performance was not disputed. We, however, are not persuaded. If it is agreed that Complainant gave a good interview, then it is all the more suspicious that she was not given a second interview. The Agency tries to persuade us that the AJ's additional adverse inferences were excessive, and essentially created Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. It asserts that the AJ should not have also inferred that Complainant performed better than all the other candidates and "inventing facts about [Manager T's] actions regarding other candidates." In light of the destruction of all interview notes, and Manager T's inability to recall details, we do not find the AJ's adverse inferences to be an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find that the AJ erred in disregarding the composition of the selectees. The Agency failed to provide statistics regarding the demographics of the candidates at each level of interview, and various managers conducted first-round interviews. As noted by the AJ, in light of the missing interview notes and statistics, we do not know if Manager T, for example, only recommended younger, white candidates for the second round of interviews. The resulting selectees who are within Complainant's protected classes may have been initially interviewed and recommended by a manager other than Manager T. Therefore, we agree with the AJ, that the race and age of some of the selectees is not entitled to the evidentiary weight that the Agency is seeking. We find that Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency was given the opportunity to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not granting Complainant a second-level interview. Even in light of the fact that it does not dispute Complainant performed well, the Agency believes it has met this burden by simply stating that the interviewing Manager did not recommend her for a second interview without any explanation. The Agency's circular reasoning clearly does not meet its burden. The AJ's conclusion that the Agency failed to present a non-discriminatory reason is supported by the instant record. The Commission agrees that Complainant has established she was subjected to discrimination, based on her race and age, when she was not promoted to the CAM position.</p>
