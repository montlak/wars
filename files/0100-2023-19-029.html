<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-22"><span class="space">2.</span> Genuine Mistakes</h4>
<p class="noindent">The failure of an agency to follow its own regulations or a contract provision may be evidence of an intent to discriminate. Standing alone, however, it does not establish intent. Likewise, in misconduct cases, the focus is not on whether the employee actually engaged in the misconduct, as it is before the MSPB, but on the agency's belief that the employee engaged in misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency official has a mistaken, good faith belief for taking an action, the fact that the action violates some policy of the agency is not evidence of pretext. <span class="Italic">Crutcher v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61404 (2006). In that case, the complainant claimed race, sex and age discrimination when he was sent home for taking a break while on overtime. As a legitimate reason, the agency maintained the supervisor was not aware of the policy that allowed employees on overtime to take breaks and had not sent other employees who had taken breaks while on overtime home because they were not in the break room at the same time as the complainant. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crutcher</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that "a mistaken, good faith belief in the rationale for a particular action is not pretextual." <span class="Italic">Foley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924615 (March 26, 1993). In this case, complainant bears the burden not of showing that FM acted wrongly, but that FM's legitimate non-discriminatory rationale for her behavior was pretext for discrimination. Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, either that FM's claimed ignorance of Huntsville P&#x0026;DF's policy was feigned, or that FM's ignorance of the policy was not her true reason for sending complainant home. Although the complainant presented a statement from two employees asserting that FM had supervised them on overtime shifts prior to the date of the incident, a bare assertion alone will not suffice to contradict FM's averment that she was not aware of P&#x0026;DF's overtime policy. The statement does not clearly affirm that FM observed the employees taking overtime breaks, or that FM had knowledge that employees are entitled to overtime breaks. Aside from this vague assertion, there is no evidence in the record indicating that FM actually was aware of the policy at the time, or that she sent complainant home for any reason other than her mistaken belief that complainant should not have been taking a break. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission affirms the agency's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proper basis for the decision of an administrative judge is not whether the factors used by the agency in reaching an employment decision were accurate or inaccurate. <span class="Italic">Burkhardt v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880631 (1988). "[I]n reviewing an agency action to determine whether it was based on prohibited discriminatory criteria or factors, the only factors relevant for a determination are those factors actually considered by the agency. . . ." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In that case, the Commission overturned the administrative judge's use of an amended attendance record for the complainant and a comparative employee, finding instead that the relevant consideration was the attendance record that was before the RMO at the time of making his decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when an agency is mistaken about its interpretation of statutes or regulations, that interpretation constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking a personnel action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Crump v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a40681.txt">01A40681</a> (2005), an agency personnel specialist improperly determined that the complainant was not eligible for a law enforcement position because of his age. The specialist's supervisor subsequently determined that the complainant was in fact eligible for the position, but by that time the vacancy had been filled. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crump</span>, found that the agency had articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its nonselection of the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases involving the agency's reliance on regulations, policies, or collective <span id="Page_700"></span>bargaining agreements, the issue is not whether the agency correctly interpreted the relevant provisions; instead, the focus is on whether the agency genuinely believed its interpretation, however erroneous, and relied on that interpretation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Capella v. USPS</span>, 01842484 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the relevant agency officials were aware of the candidates' respective races, in the absence of an intent to discriminate, an agency's misinterpretation of a provision of a union contract does not establish intentional discrimination. In this respect, the Complaints Examiner erred in his analysis. Rather than focusing on whether the agency genuinely believed that the contract required replacement of the appellant with the selectee, the Examiner instead came to his own interpretation of the union contract. In effect, the Complaints Examiner substituted his interpretation of the contract for that of the agency's and then concluded, based on his interpretation of the contract, the agency must have acted with discriminatory intent. Such a finding cannot be made, however, in the absence of a determination as to whether the agency actually believed its interpretation of the contract was the correct one.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Capella</span>, the contract provision was never disputed and in the past the agency applied it in a manner consistent with the interpretation provided at the hearing. Of course, the reasonableness of the agency's interpretation of a contract provision is a factor for consideration in determining whether the agency's belief in its interpretation is genuine. See also the section below on "<a href="0100-2023-19-052.html#sec10-45">Reliance of Agency Regulations</a>," for a discussion of an agency's reliance on regulations and contract provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency relies on a policy directive to determine that an employee must be terminated to comport with a staffing advisory, whether the agency's interpretation of the directive is correct is not relevant to determining discriminatory intent. In <span class="Italic">Natividad v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01954970 (1997), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the memorandum from the agency Commissioner, instant although temporary staffing actions had to take place in order to comply with budget restrictions that arose because of a threat of a government furlough. The agency's hiring activity cited by appellant took place during the time the Commissioner's staffing advisory was issued. Furthermore, the Commissioner's advisory stated that all temporary appointments should not be renewed. Agency officials considered appellant's appointment as a reemployed annuitant a temporary appointment. Thus, based on this view, the agency terminated appellant in accordance with the Commissioner's staffing advisory. Whether or not the agency was wrong in their assessment that a reemployed annuitant appointment is the same as a temporary appointment is irrelevant<span class="Italic">. See Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc.</span>, 555 F.2d 1251 (5th Cir. 1977),. . .Where an employer wrongly believes an employee has violated company policy, it does not discriminate in violation of Title VII if it acts on that belief.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence showing that an employee is wrongly denied a detail does not necessarily give rise to an inference of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Mangabat v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953848 (1997), the supervisor stated that appellant was not selected for a detail because she was on limited duty and was physically unqualified to perform the duties of the 204-B supervisory position. The Commission noted that the record admittedly lacked the evidence necessary to establish what the physical requirements of the 204-B supervisory positions were, and that it appeared from the testimony that the supervisor may have wrongly denied appellant a detail. Nonetheless, the Commission found that appellant failed to prove discrimination because she offered no evidence of discriminatory motivation on the part of any agency official, nor did she successfully rebut the supervisor's proffered explanation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that agency officials rely on a medical report and the findings of that report are later overturned does not establish pretext. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120132795 (2015), agency managers relied on a medical report from a fitness-for-duty examination that concluded that the complainant was suffering from a severe mental illness. The complainant appealed the findings of that report to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which overturned the earlier report based on documentation from the complainant's treating physicians. The Commission rejected the complainant's contention that this established discrimination, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the fitness-for-duty examination and the letter of reprimand, the Deputy Assistant had received reports from multiple sources that Complainant had exhibited bizarre behavior in accusing her fellow BDO of rape and asking intensely personal questions of the BDO's spouse. While Complainant may believe otherwise, the record clearly establishes that management followed the Agency's protocols in requiring Complainant to undergo the fitness-for-duty examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to the termination, the record overwhelmingly establishes that the Deputy Assistant FSD relied on the 300-page medical report from the Psychologist and the two Federal Occupational Health Consultants in proposing Complainant's removal. The Deputy FSD had likewise relied upon that same report in sustaining the removal. The fact that the findings in the report were later overturned does not establish that either official had reason to question the Agency's own experts on the validity of their report at the time they made their respective decisions on the removal action. In other words, the Deputy Assistant FSD and the Deputy FSD reasonably relied on the judgment of the experts who were recommending that Complainant be fired. While Complainant asserts that the actions taken by the Deputy Assistant FSD and the Deputy FSD were unlawfully motivated, she has not presented any sworn statements from other witnesses or documents that contradict the explanations provided by these officials, or which call their veracity into question.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dionne v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 209 F.3d 705 (8th Cir. 2000), the court found the failure of the agency to use the correct classification standards did not demonstrate pretext where there was no evidence that the error was anything other than an honest mistake. The Eighth Circuit ruled in <span class="Italic">Dionne</span>, 209 F.3d at 709-10:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are left only with evidence that the Secretary applied the wrong standards to Dionne's application. In other words, Dionne only has evidence that the Secretary's nondiscriminatory reason that she was not qualified was based on the Secretary's application of the X-118 standards rather than the Indian Preference Act standards as established in the December 1986 transmittal. There is absolutely no evidence that the application of the wrong standards was anything but an honest mistake. The Secretary's stated reason for the GS-7 classification of Dionne was, in fact, the Secretary's actual reason. We do not believe this evidence can show pretext or still less that it can give rise to a reasonable inference of intentional discrimination. Without more, the evidence only shows that the Secretary applied the wrong standards in the context of a complex administrative system--a system so complex that even the parties to this lawsuit failed to bring the December 1986 transmittal to the attention of the District Court. That the December 1986 transmittal standards should have been applied because Dionne is a tribal member does not make the Secretary's inadvertent failure to do so somehow based on race or national origin. The Supreme Court has held that the application of Indian preference does not constitute invidious racial discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment<span class="Italic">. See Morton v. Mancari</span>, 417 U.S. 535, 551-55 (1974).)(9) Dionne cannot have it both ways; the Secretary's mistaken failure to apply the standards also does not amount to discrimination. Of course, it is possible that a failure to apply the Indian preference standards could be motivated by discriminatory animus. But here, we simply have no evidence that was the case. Without such evidence, Dionne's Title VII claim must fall. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(9)&#x2003;The Indian Preference Act is not an antidiscrimination law. "Rather, it is an employment criterion reasonably designed to further the cause of Indian self-government and to make the [Bureau of Indian Affairs] more responsive to the needs of its constituent groups. It is directed to participation by the governed in the governing agency." <span class="Italic">Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 554.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, a strongly worded dissent issued in <span class="Italic">Dionne</span>, 209 F.3d at 711-12, criticized the majority holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, the Supreme Court stated, "the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination will be rebutted if the employer articulates lawful reasons for the action. . . ." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 257 (emphasis added). Additionally, <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> defines the adjective "legitimate" as "[c]omplying with the law; lawful." <span class="Italic">BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY</span> 912 (7th ed. 1999). Thus, by usage and definition, an unlawful or illegal ground cannot serve to satisfy an employer's burden of articulating a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." [12] In this matter, after Dionne established her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the Secretary's proffered "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its action rested solely on the conclusion that she was not qualified for a higher grade under the general civil service qualification standards. The majority now concedes that the Secretary acted unlawfully in applying these standards; yet it allows such illegality to stand. Such a conclusion belies logic.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(12)&#x2003;This discussion of the inherent failure of unlawful reasons should not be taken out of context. In <span class="Italic">Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins</span>, 507 U.S. 604, 612 (1993), the Supreme Court stated "it cannot be true that an employer who fires an older black worker because the worker is black thereby violates the ADEA. The employee's race is an improper reason, but it is improper under Title VII, not the ADEA." Thus, the Court has noted that articulation of an illegal but true reason, unrelated to the claim at issue, may satisfy an employer's burden. However, the discussion in Hazen stands in contrast to the instant facts. Here the articulated reason was lack of qualification under the X-118 standards. The very application of such standards directly violates laws designed to give preferential treatment to Native Americans in employment. Such illegality is intricately related to the Title VII claim at stake.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the record before us, the Secretary failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision; thus, Dionne's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and its corresponding presumption remain unrebutted. <span id="Page_701"></span>Consequently, the district court should have granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of Dionne. In failing to do so, the district court, and now this court, permit a governmental agency to escape liability under Title VII by pleading ignorance of its own rules, legislation, and of antidiscrimination laws. The IPA and the 1986 standards were designed to overcome the historically recognized negative effects of non-Indian control of Indian affairs and to facilitate the return of control to Indians. Title VII was designed, in part, to remedy race and national origin discrimination in employment. Today's holding undermines each of these objectives by simultaneously acknowledging the applicability of the laws and standards while excusing their violation because of alleged ignorance. Such strained analysis surely must fail.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pineda v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952287 (1997), the appellant claimed that the agency's failure to follow its established disciplinary procedures constituted evidence of discrimination. The Commission found that ignorance of the procedures, rather than discrimination, was likely the reason that the procedures were not followed. The Commission noted that the courts have stated that an employer may base a decision on a mistaken belief, if the belief was not based on a prohibited factor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Assn.</span>, 615 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir. 1980). In <span class="Italic">Pineda</span> the appellant and another employee were suspended and issued proposed removals for sabotaging a mail machine. A mechanic at the facility reported the alleged misconduct. The appellant grieved the claim, and an arbitrator held that management had not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant committed the offense forming the basis for her removal. With respect to the removal, the arbitrator found that the mechanic had a motive to be disingenuous. Specifically, the mechanic was rebuffed by the appellant when he tried to flirt with her. Based on this information, the arbitrator awarded the appellant reinstatement and restored seniority. However, the arbitrator declined to award back pay and benefits because the appellant refused to cooperate with the agency investigation. The appellant argued that the precipitating factor in her emergency suspension and removal was the agency's failure to follow procedure and secure a written statement from the parties. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pineda</span> responded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While appellant claims agency procedures were not followed, this in itself does not show discrimination. Here, the agency, through RO 2, provided the following explanation for not following past practice. RO [Responding Official] 2 stated that the allegation was serious and therefore an emergency suspension was warranted. Appellant argues that if her situation was as serious as agency officials represent then she would not have been allowed to work the remainder of her shift and the next day. RO 2 also stated that he had no reason to question the veracity of the Mechanic. Appellant argues that without the benefit of an investigation RO 2 had no basis for judging the Mechanic's veracity or her veracity. RO 2 testified that he thought RO 1 had obtained appellant's version of the incident. RO 1 testified that she told RO 2 that she only asked appellant if she had seen Employee 1 tampering with BSC Machine #2, and that appellant stated that Employee 1 was nowhere near the machine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant indicated that she did not cooperate with the Inspector because she was not clear as to the specific allegations. The agency argues that the information was provided in the notice of removal. The record indicates that the notice of removal was dated September 17, 1990, while the Investigator contacted appellant in July 1990. Thus, at the time appellant refused to cooperate she did not have the details relating to the alleged incident and the name of the witness to the alleged incident. However, once appellant was provided with a detailed explanation for the agency's action, she still did not provide any statement until the arbitration hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that, even though the agency in <span class="Italic">Pineda</span> failed to follow its established procedures, the appellant failed to show that the agency was motivated by discriminatory animus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission agrees with the AJ's position that the event that prompted the emergency suspension and the removal was the lack of a written statement from appellant, the Commission finds that this is insufficient to demonstrate that RO 1's and RO 2's actions (emergency suspension and notice of removal) toward appellant were motivated by her national origin or sex. There is nothing in the record to indicate national origin or sex-discriminatory animus on the part of RO 1 or RO 2. Further, RO 1 provided undisputed testimony that she was unsure of how to handle the situation. Her ignorance of appropriate procedures was more likely the reason for the lack of a written statement than any other hypothesis presented in the record. The events that followed, while unfortunate, were not discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Rinehart v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00243 (2000), filed an EEO complaint alleging that he was discriminatorily terminated on the basis of his sex. The complainant was terminated by the agency because his supervisor accused him of raping her. The supervisor immediately reported the rape to her supervisor and was taken to a hospital. Complainant was arrested the following day on charges of sexually assaulting and raping the supervisor. On complainant's complaint stemming from his termination in <span class="Italic">Rinehart</span>, the Commission rejected the complainant's argument that the discipline was discriminatory because he was acquitted on the rape charge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ then concluded that the agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, namely, that after reviewing documents, including the criminal transcript, and interviewing witnesses, agency officials collectively believed that complainant sexually assaulted and raped his supervisor on November 7, 1996. In support of the agency's reasons, the AJ noted that the Manager of Post Office Operations believed the supervisor because she immediately reported the incident, and her story remained consistent. In contrast, complainant was not credible because his statement was not consistent and he refused to speak with postal inspectors following the incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that in misconduct cases, the critical inquiry is on the agency's actual belief, regardless whether the agency's belief are later determined to erroneous. The AJ then determined that complainant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the agency official's belief that he sexually assaulted his supervisor was a pretext for sex discrimination. Although complainant argued that his acquittal was tantamount to a finding that the supervisor lied, the AJ disagreed, stating that the burden of proof is different in a criminal case. In sum, the AJ found that the agency reasonably believed the supervisor's version of the events. This belief, and not discrimination, motivated the decision to terminate his employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission went on to concur with the AJ, and stressed the importance of the agency's belief in making its decision in <span class="Italic">Rinehart</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's recommended decision summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. We note that complainant failed to present evidence that any of the agency's actions were motivated by a discriminatory animus toward complainant's sex. Rather, the evidence supports the agency's position that they removed complainant because they believed complainant committed a rape on his supervisor. This belief, not the arbitrator's as complainant contends, is the critical inquiry. Complainant failed to introduce sufficient evidence that would establish a dispute as whether agency officials believed he committed the assault. We discern no basis to disturb the AJ's recommended decision. Therefore, after a careful review of the record, including complainant's contentions on appeal, and arguments and evidence not specifically addressed in this decision, we affirm the agency's final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 03A20027 (2002). In that case, the Commission held that the MSPB's finding that the agency failed to sustain its charge was not persuasive evidence that the discipline was a pretext for discrimination. The Commission held the issue was not whether the agency was correct in determining that the complainant had participated in a coordinated "sick out," but whether the agency "was acting on a good faith belief that petitioner had participated in the 'sick out' when it issued her notice or removal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The same rationale applies to selection cases. Where the responsible agency official genuinely believes the truthfulness of the reasons for not selecting the complainant, it is not relevant that the reasons are untrue. For example, in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01990218 (2002), the Commission found the complainant's contentions that he had not engaged in sexual harassment and had not taken credit for another employee's ideas were not relevant because the selecting official genuinely believed the complainant committed the offenses and relied upon that belief in failing to select him. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Attorney General</span>, 01A20985 (2003), the Commission found the agency's failure to fully consider the complainant's previous law enforcement experience was not evidence of discrimination where there was no indication the error was anything other than inadvertent.</p>
