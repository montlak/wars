<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-115"><span id="Page_427"></span><span class="space">2.</span> Court Decisions: Void vs. Voidable</h4>
<p class="noindent">There was, however, a split in the circuit courts of appeals over whether a settlement agreement that does not meet the minimum requirements of the Older Workers' Benefits Protection Act is void or voidable. There was a further split as to whether a plaintiff must tender back any benefits received under such a settlement as a prerequisite to filing suit. The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> and resolved the latter issue in <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc</span>., 522 U.S. 422, 118 S. Ct. 838, 139 L. Ed.2d 849 (1998). An ADEA plaintiff is not required to tender back any benefits obtained under a settlement that violates the OWBPA to maintain an age discrimination suit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issues involved in this split among the circuits were set out in detail in <span class="Italic">Long v. Sears Roebuck &#x0026; Co</span>., 105 F.3d 1529 (3rd Cir. 1997). The <span class="Italic">Long</span> panel, 105 F.3d at 1534-44, found it was unnecessary to resolve whether settlement agreements that do not meet the minimum requirements of the Older Workers' Benefits Protection Act are void or voidable because, in either instance, a plaintiff is not required to return any benefits under the agreement in order to file suit under the ADEA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act became effective on October 16, 1990, as an amendment to the ADEA. Its purpose was two-fold: to "make[ ] clear that discrimination on the basis of age in virtually all forms of employee benefits is unlawful," and to "ensure[ ] that older workers are not coerced or manipulated into waiving their rights to seek legal relief under the ADEA." S. Rep. No. 263, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1990). Congress' concern over employee waiver of rights under the ADEA was summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[E]arly retirees or employees offered the chance to participate in exit incentive or other group termination programs can effectively be forced to waive their right to file a claim when the employer conditions such participation on the signing of a waiver. The problem is particularly acute in large-scale terminations and lay-offs, where an individual employee would not reasonably be expected to know or suspect that age may have played a role in the employer's decision, or that the program may be designed to remove older workers from the labor force. The preemptive waiver of rights occurs before a dispute has arisen and indeed before an employee is even aware of any potential or actual pattern of discrimination. Such a preemptive waiver may also preclude the employee from asserting claims that arise out of subsequent discriminatory conduct by the employer, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span> hiring younger workers to replace the terminated older workers. These waivers are both unfair and inconsistent with the intent of the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S.&#x2003;Rep. No. 79, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1989). The Report emphasized the need for protective legislation, noting that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Age discrimination victims typically earn more than the minimum wage, but their average annual income is only $15,000. Moreover, once out of work, these older Americans have less than a 50/50 chance of ever finding new employment. The[y] often have little or no savings, and may not yet be eligible for Social Security. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that many employees would be coerced by circumstances into accepting significant compromises. This is especially true where employees are unable even to recognize the potential of their claims because no dispute exists between them and their employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. In an effort to protect older workers, Title II of the OWBPA defined those circumstances in which ADEA waivers would be permitted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the OWBPA, the general approach of the courts was to find waivers permissible subject to a requirement that they be made "knowingly" and "willfully." "Under the [OWBPA,] waivers must [still] be made knowingly and voluntarily. However, they cannot be deemed to be so unless several statutory minima are met." Pellicciotti, <span class="Italic">Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990: Congress Responds to Betts Decision</span>, 35 Res Gestae 114, 115 (1991). These minimum requirements are set forth at 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;An individual may not waive any right or claim under this chapter unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary....[A] waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;the waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by such individual...;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this chapter;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;the individual does not waive rights or claims that arise after the date the waiver is executed;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual already is entitled;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(E)&#x2003;the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(F)&#x2003;...(ii) if a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees, the individual is given...at least 45 days within which to consider the agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(G)&#x2003;the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(H)&#x2003;if a waiver is requested in connection with an...employment termination program...the employer...notifies the individual in writing in a manner calculated to be understood...as to--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;any class, unit or group of individuals covered by such program, any eligibility factors for such program, and any time limits applicable...; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;the job titles and ages of all individuals eligible or selected for the program, and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are not eligible or selected....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute also specifies that the party asserting the validity of the waiver bears the burden of showing that the waiver was indeed knowing and voluntary. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Congress carefully defined what must be included in a knowing and voluntary waiver under the ADEA, it did not characterize the legal effect of a release which fails to satisfy the statutory requirements. Courts asked to determine whether deficient waivers should be enforced have purported to rely on "clear" congressional intent. They have reached different conclusions, however, with respect to whether Congress intended that waivers deficient under the OWBPA be declared void or merely voidable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The view that deficient releases are void was adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Oberg v. Allied Van Lines, Inc.</span>, 11 F.3d 679 (7th Cir. 1993). The court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> held that releases which fail to conform to the OWBPA have no legal significance; they cannot be ratified or enforced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on OWBPA language that "[a]n individual <span class="Italic">may not waive</span> any right or claim...unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary," the court concluded that, "unless a waiver contract takes the form required by the statute, an employer and an employee cannot contract to waive the ADEA provisions.... No matter how many times parties may try to ratify such a contract, the language of the OWBPA...forbids any waiver." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 682. In light of the OWBPA's unambiguous statutory prohibition against waiver where one or more of the statutory requirements are absent, the court concluded that further analysis was unwarranted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When the plain text of a statute is clear then "courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says. When the words of a statute are unambiguous then, this first canon is also the last: 'judicial inquiry is complete.'" <span class="Italic">Connecticut Nat. Bank. v. Germain</span>, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149, 117 L. Ed.2d 391 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 682 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having pronounced non-conforming releases void, the court next considered whether an employee is required to tender back severance benefits in order to maintain suit under the ADEA. The court concluded that employees "were not required to tender back their severance benefits before filing ADEA claims, notwithstanding [the] previously executed waiver of all claims...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 684.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Fifth Circuits have rejected the <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> approach, holding instead that defective waivers are merely voidable and are, therefore, subject to ratification by an employee's retention of severance benefits. <span class="Italic">See Wamsley v. Champlin Refining and Chemicals, Inc.</span>, 11 F.3d 534 (5th Cir. 1993); and <span class="Italic">Blistein v. St. John's College</span>, 74 F.3d 1459 (4th Cir. 1996). In <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span> the court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We do not interpret the language of section 626(f)(1) [of the OWBPA] to mean that a waiver which fails to meet the requirements of subsections (A) through (H) is void of legal effect. Rather, we interpret it to mean that such waivers are not knowing and voluntary and thus are subject to being avoided at the election of the employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Therefore, we hold that neither the language nor the purpose of the OWBPA indicates a congressional desire to deprive an employee of the ability to ratify a waiver that fails to meet the requirements of the OWBPA. When [the employees] chose to retain and not tender back to [the employer] the benefits paid them in consideration for their promise not to sue..., they manifested their intention to be bound by the waivers and thus, made a new promise to abide by their terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 539-40. In part, the court's conclusions were drawn from the legislative history of the OWBPA:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The legislative history indicates that the fundamental purpose of the OWBPA waiver provisions is to ensure that an older worker who is asked to sign an ADEA waiver does so in the absence of <span id="Page_428"></span>fraud, duress, coercion, or mistake of material facts. S. Rep. No. 101-263, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990).... The circumstances against which these provisions were designed to protect are the same circumstances that have traditionally given rise to grounds upon which a party can avoid contractual obligations. That the Committee enumerated several of the traditional grounds of avoidance is significant. Also significant is the absence of any language in the statute and any statement in the legislative history indicating that a waiver executed in contravention of the OWBPA requirements is void...and cannot be ratified....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also cited section 626(f)(1)(G) of the Act which provides that an employee may revoke a waiver for any reason within seven days of its execution and that the agreement is not enforceable during that seven-day period. "If non-compliance with the other subparts of section 626(f) (1) rendered the agreement void, there would be no need for subpart (G)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 539. According to the court, declaring defective waivers void:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">would be inconsistent with one of the expressed purposes of the ADEA: "to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment." 29 USC &#x00A7; 621(b). The simplest and easiest way to further this purpose is to give effect to private agreements which resolve age-related employment problems without the inevitable delays and costs associated with litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the court held that "justice and equity require the employee who seeks to avoid the obligations to which he agreed under the settlement agreement to return the consideration which he received for his promise not to sue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 542.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the district court in the case before us adopted the reasoning underlying the decision in <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span>, on balance we find the <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> approach to tender back to be more consistent with the purposes underlying the OWBPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we, like the court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span>, reject the argument that Long is precluded from maintaining an ADEA claim because he retained severance benefits, we reach this end via a different route. In both <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> and <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span> the courts focused first upon whether a defective release should be characterized as void or voidable. It was only after this question was resolved that the courts considered the import of the plaintiff's failure to return severance benefits. In <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span>, the court concluded that the allegedly defective release was voidable. The plaintiff's retention of benefits served to ratify the defective release and, therefore, suit was barred. The court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> reasoned that defective releases were void and that ratification could not apply. The court found it necessary, however, to address the issue of retention of severance benefits in that tender back of benefits has been viewed by some courts as a prerequisite to suit. The court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> relied on Supreme Court precedent and other policy arguments to hold that tender back should not be a prerequisite to an ADEA suit where the release at issue is defective under the OWBPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the analysis in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> and <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span> might suggest otherwise, resolution of the void/voidable issue does not control our disposition of this appeal. No matter how we characterize a release which fails to comply with the OWBPA--void or voidable--we must, under either theory, decide whether Long's retention of severance benefits should prevent him from pursuing his ADEA claim. Because we conclude that neither ratification nor tender back was meant to apply in the ADEA context, we need not address the void/voidable distinction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> declared that releases which fail to conform to the OWBPA are void and, consequently, found it unnecessary to consider the ratification doctrine. Our analysis, however, requires that we consider its application. The language of the OWBPA and its legislative history convince us Congress did not intend that the ratification doctrine be invoked to enforce the terms of a deficient release.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the OWBPA, it was generally recognized that employees could waive federal ADEA rights in private settlements with their employees so long as the employees' consent to the settlement was knowing and voluntary. Even during this pre-OWBPA period, however, there was disagreement over the standard to be applied in assessing whether a waiver was, in fact, knowing and voluntary. The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth and Eighth Circuits held that ordinary state contract law principles controlled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We, however, elected to apply a more stringent federal "totality of the circumstances test," reasoning that "in recognition of the important interests involved...careful evaluation of the release form itself as well as the complete circumstances in which it was executed [is] warranted." <span class="Italic">Cirillo v. Arco Chemical Co.</span>, 862 F.2d 448, 450 (3d Cir. 1988). Factors relevant in assessing the totality of the circumstances included, but were not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the clarity and specificity of the release language; (2) the plaintiff's education and business experience; (3) the amount of time plaintiff had for deliberation about the release before signing it; (4) whether plaintiff knew or should have known his rights upon execution of the release; (5) whether plaintiff was encouraged to seek, or in fact received benefit of counsel; (6) whether there was an opportunity for negotiation of the terms of the Agreement; and (7) whether the consideration given in exchange for the waiver and accepted by the employee exceed[ed] the benefits to which the employee was already entitled by contract or law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 451.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In enacting the OWBPA, Congress resolved this dispute regarding the standard to be applied in determining whether a release is "knowing and voluntary." Congress rejected the applicability of common law contract principles and declined to embrace even the more demanding "totality of the circumstances" test:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Even the decisions that have followed the more protective "totality of the circumstances" approach...have not held that certain protective factors must be present.... The [OWBPA], by contrast, will limit unsupervised waivers to certain situations and then spell out clear and ascertainable standards to govern those situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S.&#x2003;Rep. No. 79, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 17 (1989) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirements established in order for releases to be "knowing and voluntary" under the OWBPA clearly exceed the protections available under the common law. The right to seek counsel, the 45-day consideration period, the seven-day right of revocation, and the provision of detailed information about those affected by group terminations are all protections which were unavailable under the "knowing and voluntary" standard of the common law. In addition, the OWBPA establishes that waivers must be in writing, must specifically refer to rights under the ADEA, and are subject "to an average person" standard; whether a particular plaintiff understood the implications of the release is irrelevant. The OWBPA also effected a shift in the burden of proof applicable in judicial proceedings. Where, under the common law, the employee challenging a waiver was required to show that the waiver was not "knowing and voluntary," the OWBPA shifts this burden to the employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f)(3). These requirements, too, overrode pre-OWBPA decisions applying common law principles. Most importantly, Congress, after grappling with the question of whether to permit ADEA waivers at all, stated unequivocally that unless the enumerated requirements are met, an individual "<span class="Italic">may not waive</span>" ADEA rights. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are convinced that in enacting the OWBPA, Congress intended to occupy the area of ADEA releases and, in doing so, to supplant the common law; the OWBPA was enacted to "establish[ ] a floor, not a ceiling." <span class="Italic">Soliman v. Digital Equipment</span>, 869 F. Supp. 65, 68 n.12 (D. Mass. 1994). Enforceability of a waiver is made contingent upon the presence of certain enumerated factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the clear and specific goals of the OWBPA, we cannot accept that Congress intended that the common law doctrine of ratification be applied to releases invalid under the OWBPA. The common law fiction of a "new promise" forged from retention of benefits has no place in this statutory scheme. To conclude otherwise would be to say that Congress only intended that the OWBPA requirements apply to the "first" waiver. Such a result is inconsistent with the aims of the Act and works a hardship on employees who could not have known that by retaining severance pay they were, in effect, declining the protection of the OWBPA. This conclusion applies as well to the common law concept of tender back of benefits as a prerequisite to suit under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although our rejection of the ratification and tender back theories could rest alone on the language and legislative history of the OWBPA, we find additional support for our position in Supreme Court precedent and the caselaw interpreting that precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the leading case rejecting a tender back requirement under the ADEA, <span class="Italic">Oberg</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the employer's argument that "Plaintiffs must tender back the consideration received for executing...Severance Agreements" in order to maintain a claim under the ADEA. 11 F.3d 679, 683. Recognizing that the requirement might initially seem "appealing under common law notions of fairness," the court nonetheless held that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Hogue v. Southern R. Co.</span>, 390 U.S. 516, 88 S. Ct. 1150, 20 L. Ed.2d 73 (1968), compelled a different result. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hogue</span>, a brief <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> opinion, the Supreme Court considered the tender back requirement in a case arising under the Federal Employer's Liability Act ("FELA"), 45 USC &#x00A7; 51 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (1939). Stating that the tender back question was to be resolved under federal rather than state law, the Court concluded that requiring a refund would be "wholly incongruous with the general policy of the [FELA]."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 518, 88 S. Ct. at 1152 (citation omitted). The court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> summarized the <span class="Italic">Hogue</span> decision as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In <span class="Italic">Hogue</span>, the Court rejected any notion that state common law principles could help resolve the tender back question in FELA <span id="Page_429"></span>cases. The Court stated that "[t]he question whether a tender back of the consideration was a prerequisite to the bringing of the suit is to be determined by federal rather than state law." The Court went on to hold that an employee, who previously executed an employer release, need not, as a precondition to bringing suit under FELA tender back to his employer any of the consideration he received for executing the release. The Court did, however, state that the benefits paid should be deducted from any award to the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 683-84 (citations omitted). The Court in <span class="Italic">Oberg</span> was "convinced that...analogizing the policy of [the] ADEA to that of [the] FELA, and thus applying <span class="Italic">Hogue</span>, [was] correct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 684. We agree, based on a number of factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we note that courts have regularly applied the analysis in <span class="Italic">Hogue</span> to reject tender requirements in lawsuits brought under a variety of federal remedial statutes. It is impossible to view the ADEA as anything other than a federal remedial statute. The ADEA was enacted in order to further the dual goals of compensating discrimination victims and deterring employers from practicing discrimination. As the Supreme Court wrote in <span class="Italic">McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.</span>, 513 U.S. 352, __, 115 S. Ct. 879, 884, 130 L. Ed.2d 852 (1995): "The private litigant who seeks redress for his or her injuries vindicates both the deterrence and compensation objectives of the ADEA." In light of this clear recognition of the purpose of the ADEA, we are confident that the tender back rule rejected in suits under the FELA should be rejected in suits under the ADEA as well. Imposing a tender back rule in the ADEA context would almost certainly compromise the purposes underlying that statute. The concerns expressed by our sister court in the pre-OWBPA case of <span class="Italic">Forbus v. Sears Roebuck &#x0026; Company</span>, 958 F.2d 1036, 1041 (11th Cir. 1992), apply with equal force here:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Court in <span class="Italic">Hogue</span> found that a tender requirement would deter meritorious challenges to releases in FELA lawsuits. The same deterrence factor applies to ADEA claims. Forcing older employees to tender back their severance benefits in order to attempt to regain their jobs would have a crippling effect [sic] on the ability of such employees to challenge releases obtained by misrepresentation or duress. Such a rule would...encourage egregious behavior on the part of employers in forcing certain employees into early retirement for the economic benefit of the company. The ADEA was specifically designed to prevent such conduct, and we reject a tender requirement as a prerequisite to instituting a challenge to a release in an ADEA case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, any doubt about whether <span class="Italic">Hogue's</span> rejection of the tender back rule should apply to ADEA claims was resolved with the enactment of the OWBPA. The very specific requirements of this Act, considered against the background of its legislative history, demonstrate that Congress intended to provide protections unavailable at common law; congressional focus extended beyond ensuring that ADEA releases were untainted by fraud, duress, or some other defect recognized at common law. Congress explicitly stated that it intended to protect employees who might waive rights under the ADEA before they were "even aware of any potential or actual pattern of discrimination." H.R. Rep. No. 664 at 23. <span class="Italic">See also</span> S. Rep. No. 263, 101st Cong.2d Sess. 32 (1990) (recognizing "need for adequate information before waivers are signed."). Imposing a tender requirement where a release is defective under the OWBPA would effectively eviscerate that act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Through the OWBPA Congress sought to insure that employees faced with deciding whether to sign an ADEA waiver and forego an ADEA claim be provided with sufficient information to allow them to evaluate the merits of that claim. Applying a ratification-tender back rule would require employees in Long's position, who arguably did not receive the required information, to make a similarly uninformed choice. These employees would be forced by the ratification and tender back doctrines to decide, in the continued absence of information, whether to surrender severance pay or waive all claims under the OWBPA. Employees whose releases are defective under the OWBPA would be no better off than before the OWBPA was enacted; they could be forced to make critical decisions without information deemed essential by Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The choice which the <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span> approach, adopted by the district court, places before older employees amounts to no choice at all: pursue your claim at the risk of your livelihood. Testimony before Congress established that older workers facing termination "could not afford" to do without separation benefits. <span class="Italic">Age Discrimination in Employment Waiver Protection Act of 1989: Hearing on 5.54 Before the Subcomm. on Labor of the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong.</span>, 1st Sess. 61 (1989) (Testimony of Robert Patterson). Other excerpts from the OWBPA's legislative history emphasize the economic plight of older workers and Congress' intention to better equip them to make choices directly affecting their rights and livelihood. Applying ratification or a tender back requirement in the circumstances presented here would mean that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[n]o matter how egregiously releases might violate the requirements of the [OWBPA], employees would be precluded from challenging them unless they somehow...come up with the money they were given when allegedly forced into retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Isaacs v. Caterpillar, Inc.</span>, 765 F. Supp. 1359, 1367 (C.D. Ill. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts which have applied tender-ratification principles to ADEA releases which fail to conform to the OWBPA have rendered the OWBPA meaningless. The gist of these holdings is, as Long argues, "to uphold flawed ADEA releases [to] block discrimination claims [rather] than...require employers to comply fully with federal law." (Long br. at 38).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Application of the tender-ratification doctrines and rejection of <span class="Italic">Hogue</span> stem, we believe, from an incomplete analysis of the equities involved in allowing an employee to retain severance benefits while pursuing ADEA claims. The court in <span class="Italic">Wamsley</span> expressed concern that were ratification and tender back held not to apply, employers would face "continued litigation with opponents who could use, and very possibly already have used, to finance their suit, the very funds paid as consideration to avoid litigation." 11 F.3d at 539. <span class="Italic">Amicus</span>, Equal Employment Advisory Council, frames the concern even more starkly, warning that abrogation of the tender-ratification doctrines, "improperly encourages nefarious plaintiffs to secure the benefits awarded for signing a release and then press for more gains through a legal challenge." (Br. at 7). While this argument, although stated in extreme terms, is not without merit, it misperceives the economic reality for many older workers. The congressional assumptions underlying the OWBPA posit that most covered employees need severance benefits to fund living rather than legal expenses. Employees with baseless claims have strong financial incentives to keep severance payments rather than risk them in prolonged litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither will rejecting ratification and tender back principles mean that employees will receive a "double recovery" by first accepting a severance payment and later winning a judgment. An employer found liable will be entitled to a set-off of any severance benefits paid. <span class="Italic">Oberg</span>, 11 F.3d at 684. In any event, the windfall argument cuts two ways. Presumably, employers offer severance packages, in part, in exchange for the employees' release of claims. Where an employee must tender severance benefits prior to suit, it is very difficult to return that employee to his pre-release position. He is not restored to employment, the employer may still assert the release as an affirmative defense, and there is no guarantee that the employee will receive the information to which he was entitled under the OWBPA. "Such an exchange would arguably unjustly enrich the employer." <span class="Italic">Isaacs</span>, 765 F. Supp. at 1367.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The equities associated with applying the logic of <span class="Italic">Hogue</span> to eliminate the tender-ratification rule in the ADEA context are at least in equipoise. In this circumstance, we will give effect to what we believe Congress intended: the OWBPA was designed to protect employees negotiating with employers, not to protect employers from overreaching plaintiffs. Employers are, by far, in a better position to protect their own interests than are older employees. Employers should not need the ratification doctrine in order to ensure that their releases are effective; they need to comply with the OWBPA. Most OWBPA requirements are clear and specific, and, once these requirements are met, waivers executed by employees will be valid and enforceable. If prodded by necessity into following the mandates of the OWBPA, employers will have purchased a valid affirmative defense against suit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A final factor favoring <span class="Italic">Hogue's</span> rejection of a tender back rule in the ADEA context is practicality. "[I]mposing a 'tender' requirement for challenges to ADEA releases would frequently create insoluble practical problems." <span class="Italic">Isaacs</span>, 765 F. Supp. at 1367.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A tender requirement in such cases would...create a conundrum as to how much [consideration] should be tendered to restore the pre-release <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. There is no available method of forcing the parties to agree on what an appropriate amount would be, since typically the employer does not specify how much of the consideration paid to the employee is for the retirement and how much is for the release.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To require tender of the full amount of a severance payment would force an employee to return a sum that typically incorporates consideration for multiple factors not challenged in an age case: waivers for other violations of law or contract, rolled-in vacation and sick time, and a public relations benefit to the employer that itself may deter other litigation. This approach "would appear to leave the employer better off and the employee worse off than they were under the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1370. We are convinced that "[i]t would not serve the purposes of the ADEA to impose a tender requirement that creates such disputes and inequities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1368.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having examined the language of the OWBPA, the purposes underlying its enactment, and the caselaw bearing on its application, we hold that where a release of ADEA claims fails to comply with the provisions of the OWBPA, the common law doctrines of ratification and tender back <span id="Page_430"></span>should not be applied to bar an employee's ability to pursue claims under the ADEA. In light of this holding, the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Sears on claims brought pursuant to the ADEA was erroneous. Accordingly, we will reverse that portion of the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of Sears with respect to the ADEA claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc</span>., 522 U.S. 422, 118 S. Ct. 838, 139 L. Ed.2d 849 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a severance agreement that fails to comport with the requirements of the OWBPA does not bar a subsequent suit under the ADEA. Moreover, the Court found the employee was not required to tender back any benefits under the agreement in order to maintain the suit. The decision, however, is somewhat unclear as to whether such an agreement is void or voidable. The difference is not entirely academic. If such an agreement is void, an employer could opt to not fulfill its obligations under the contract, regardless of whether the employee filed suit under the ADEA. If such contract is voidable, then the employer's obligations would remain intact, at least until such time as the employee filed suit. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, in which Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer joined.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span> was told that her performance was considered poor. She was given the option of a performance improvement period, which could result in termination, or resigning in exchange for a severance package to be paid over several months. The employee was given 14 days to consider her options, and during that period she consulted with an attorney. She opted for resignation and, after receiving her severance payments, filed an age discrimination complaint with the EEOC. The agreement in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span> was deficient in that the employee was given 14 instead of 21 days to consider the proposal, the employee was not given seven days after the agreement to rescind it, and the waiver did not make specific reference to ADEA claims. After her complaint was dismissed by the EEOC, she filed suit in U.S. district court. The court dismissed the suit, finding the employee's failure to return the severance benefits amounted to a ratification of the agreement. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. In overturning the lower court's decision, Justice Kennedy in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 841-42, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer rests its case upon general principles of state contract jurisprudence. As the employer recites the rule, contracts tainted by mistake, duress, or even fraud are voidable at the option of the innocent party. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 7, and Comment b (1979); <span class="Italic">e.g., Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav. Assn.</span>, 78 Md. App. 92, 108-109, 552 A.2d 918, 926-927 (Md. Spec.App.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 316 Md. 210, 557 A.2d 1336 (1989). The employer maintains, however, that before the innocent party can elect avoidance, she must first tender back any benefits received under the contract. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dreiling v. Home State Life Ins. Co.</span>, 213 Kan. 137, 147-148, 515 P.2d 757, 766-767 (1973). If she fails to do so within a reasonable time after learning of her rights, the employer contends, she ratifies the contract and so makes it binding. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 7, Comments d, e; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Jobe v. Texas Util. Elec. Co.</span>, No. 05-94-01368-CV, 1995 WL 479645, *3 (Tex. App.-Dallas, Aug. 14, 1995) (unpublished).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer also invokes the doctrine of equitable estoppel. As a rule, equitable estoppel bars a party from shirking the burdens of a voidable transaction for as long as she retains the benefits received under it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co.</span>, 289 U.S. 227, 234, 53 S. Ct. 539, 542, 77 L. Ed. 1140 (1933) (citing state case law from Indiana and New York). Applying these principles, the employer claims the employee ratified the ineffective release (or faces estoppel) by retaining all the sums paid in consideration of it. The employer, then, relies not upon the execution of the release but upon a later, distinct ratification of its terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These general rules may not be as unified as the employer asserts. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Annot., 76 A.L.R. 344 (1932) (collecting cases supporting and contradicting these rules); Annot., 134 A.L.R. 6 (1941) (same). And in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 384, and Comment b; Restatement of Restitution &#x00A7; 65, Comment d (1936); D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#x00A7; 4.8, p. 294 (1973). Even if the employer's statement of the general rule requiring tender back before one files suit were correct, it would be unavailing. The rule cited is based simply on the course of negotiation of the parties and the alleged later ratification. The authorities cited do not consider the question raised by statutory standards for releases and a statutory declaration making non-conforming releases ineffective. It is the latter question we confront here. In 1990, Congress amended the ADEA by passing the OWBPA. The OWBPA provides: "An individual may not waive any right or claim under [the ADEA] unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary....[A] waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum" it satisfies certain enumerated requirements, including the three listed above. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory command is clear: An employee "may not waive" an ADEA claim unless the waiver or release satisfies the OWBPA's requirements. The policy of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act is likewise clear from its title: It is designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers. The OWBPA implements Congress' policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word. Congress imposed specific duties on employers who seek releases of certain claims created by statute. Congress delineated these duties with precision and without qualification: An employee "may not waive" an ADEA claim unless the employer complies with the statute. Courts cannot with ease presume ratification of that which Congress forbids.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OWBPA sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law. The statute creates a series of prerequisites for knowing and voluntary waivers and imposes affirmative duties of disclosure and waiting periods. The OWBPA governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications. The text of the OWBPA forecloses the employer's defense, notwithstanding how general contract principles would apply to non-ADEA claims. The rule proposed by the employer would frustrate the statute's practical operation as well as its formal command. In many instances a discharged employee likely will have spent the monies received and will lack the means to tender their return. These realities might tempt employers to risk noncompliance with the OWBPA's waiver provisions, knowing it will be difficult to repay the monies and relying on ratification. We ought not to open the door to an evasion of the statute by this device.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Oubre's cause of action arises under the ADEA, and the release can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA. In this case, both sides concede the release the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA. Since Oubre's release did not comply with the OWBPA's stringent safeguards, it is unenforceable against her insofar as it purports to waive or release her ADEA claim. As a statutory matter, the release cannot bar her ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contract as to other claims. In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts may need to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitution, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and these questions may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims. We need not decide those issues here, however. It suffices to hold that the release cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute. Nor did the employee's mere retention of monies amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not comply with the OWBPA any more than the oriGINAl release did. The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEA claims, and the employer cannot invoke the employee's failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Breyer, joined by Justice O'Connor, 118 S. Ct. at 843-45, wrote a separate concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, expressing his belief that the agreement was voidable but not void:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case focuses upon a worker who received a payment from her employer and in return promised not to bring an age-discrimination suit. Her promise failed the procedural tests of validity set forth in the OWBPA, 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f)(1). I agree with the majority that, because of this procedural failing, the worker is free to bring her age-discrimination suit without "tendering-back" her employer's payment as a precondition. As a conceptual matter, a "tender-back" requirement would imply that the worker had ratified her promise by keeping her employer's payment. For that reason, it would bar suit, including suit by a worker (without other assets) who had already spent the money he received for the promise. Yet such an act of ratification could embody some of the same procedural failings that led Congress to find the promise not to sue itself invalid. For these reasons, as the majority points out, a tender-back precondition requirement would run contrary to Congress' statutory command. <span class="Italic">See ante</span>, at __-__. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 85, Comment b (1979) (a promise ratifying a voidable contract "may itself be voidable for the same reason as the oriGINAl promise, or it may be voidable or unenforceable for some other reason"); D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 982 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs) ("[C]ourts must avoid allowing a recovery that has the effect of substantially enforcing the contract that has been declared unenforceable, since to do so would defeat the policy that led to the...rule in the first place"). I write these additional words because I believe it important to specify that the statute need not, and does not, thereby make the worker's procedurally invalid promise totally void, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., without any legal effect, say, like a contract the terms of which themselves are contrary to public policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 7, Comment a; 2<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 178. Rather, the statute makes the contract that the employer and worker tried to create voidable, like a contract made with an infant, or a contract created through fraud, mistake or duress, which contract the worker may elect either to avoid or to ratify. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 7 and Comment b.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a contract is voidable or void, courts typically ask whether the contract has been made under conditions that would <span id="Page_431"></span>justify giving one of the parties a choice as to validity, making it voidable, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a contract with an infant; or whether enforcement of the contract would violate the law or public policy irrespective of the conditions in which the contract was formed, making it void, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a contract to commit murder. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 1<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 7, Comment b (voidable) with 2<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 178 and Comment d (void). The statute before us reflects concern about the conditions (of knowledge and free choice) surrounding the making of a contract to waive an age-discrimination claim. It does not reflect any relevant concern about enforcing the contract's substantive terms. Nor does this statute, unlike the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 USC &#x00A7; 51 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., say that a contract waiving suit and thereby avoiding liability is void. &#x00A7; 55. Rather, as the majority's opinion makes clear, <span class="Italic">see ante</span>, at __-__, the OWBPA prohibits courts from finding ratification in certain circumstances, such as those presented here, namely, a worker's retention of a employer's payment for an invalid release. That fact may affect ratification, but it need not make the contract void, rather than voidable. That the contract is voidable rather than void may prove important. For example, an absolutely void contract, it is said, "is void as to everybody whose rights would be affected by it if valid." 17A Am.Jur.2d, Contracts &#x00A7; 7, p. 31 (1991). Were a former worker's procedurally invalid promise not to sue absolutely void, might it not become legally possible for an employer to decide to cancel its own reciprocal obligation, say, to pay the worker, or to provide ongoing health benefits--whether or not the worker in question ever intended to bring a lawsuit? It seems most unlikely that Congress, enacting a statute meant to protect workers, would have wanted to create--as a result of an employer's failure to follow the law--any such legal threat to all workers, whether or not they intend to bring suit. To find the contract voidable, rather than void, would offer legal protection against such threats. At the same time, treating the contract as voidable could permit an employer to recover his own reciprocal payment (or to avoid his reciprocal promise) where doing so seems most fair, namely, where that recovery would not bar the worker from bringing suit. Once the worker (who has made the procedurally invalid promise not to sue) brings an age-discrimination suit, he has clearly rejected (avoided) his promise not to sue. As long as there is no "tender-back" precondition, his (invalid) promise will not have barred his suit in conflict with the statute. Once he has sued, however, nothing in the statute prevents his employer from asking for restitution of his reciprocal payment or relief from any ongoing reciprocal obligation. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement of Restitution &#x00A7; 47, Comment b (1936) ("A person who transfers something to another believing that the other thereby comes under a duty to perform the terms of a contract...is ordinarily entitled to restitution for what he has given if the obligation intended does not arise and if the other does not perform"); Dobbs, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 994 (restitution is often allowed where benefits are conferred under voidable contract). A number of older state cases indicate, for example, that the amount of consideration paid for an invalid release can be deducted from a successful plaintiff's damages award. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co. v. Cox</span>, 171 Ark. 103, 113-115, 283 S.W. 31, 35 (1926) (amount paid for invalid release may be taken into consideration in setting remedy); <span class="Italic">Koshka v. Missouri Pac. R. Co.</span>, 114 Kan. 126, 129-130, 217 P. 293, 295 (1923) (the sum paid for an invalid release may be treated as an item of credit against damages); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Spokane Int'l R. Co.</span>, 82 Wash. 170, 177-178, 143 P. 981, 984 (1914) (same); <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. Western Elec. Co.</span>, 42 N.D. 206, 211-212, 172 N.W. 111, 113 (1919).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">My point is that the statute's provisions are consistent with viewing an invalid release as voidable, rather than void. Apparently, five or more Justices take this view of the matter. <span class="Italic">See post</span>, at ___ n.1, ___. As I understand the majority's opinion, it is also consistent with this view, and I consequently concur in its opinion.</p>
