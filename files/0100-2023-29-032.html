<h4 class="h4" id="sec20-33"><span class="space">3.</span> Matters Not Within Board Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the second scenario in mixed cases is that the matter at issue is clearly not within MSPB jurisdiction, but the employee has filed a Board appeal. Because of the confusion that can occur in case processing when the Board determines it does not have jurisdiction over an appeal, and because this resulted in many complainants being deprived of any forum for their discrimination complaints, the EEOC revised Part 1614 in an effort to eliminate cases where complainants lose all of their appeal rights by filing in the wrong forum. In 29 CFR 1614.302(b), the Commission provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]f a person files a mixed case appeal with the MSPB instead of a mixed case complaint and the MSPB dismisses the appeal for jurisdictional reasons, the agency shall promptly notify the individual in writing of the right to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of receipt of this notice and to file an EEO complaint, subject to &#x00A7; 1614.107. The date on which the person filed his or her appeal with MSPB shall be deemed to be the date of initial contact with the counselor. If a person files a timely appeal with MSPB from the agency's processing of a mixed case complaint and the MSPB dismisses it for jurisdictional reasons, the agency shall reissue a notice under &#x00A7; 1614.108(f) giving the individual the right to elect between a hearing before an administrative judge and an immediate final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further provision is made at 29 CFR 1614.302(c)(2) for the processing or dismissal of mixed case complaints when an appeal also is filed with the MSPB:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;Where neither the agency nor the MSPB administrative judge questions the MSPB's jurisdiction over the appeal on the same matter, it shall dismiss the mixed case complaint pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.107(d) and shall advise the complainant that he or she must bring the allegations of discrimination contained in the rejected complaint to the attention of the MSPB, pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.155. The dismissal of such a complaint shall advise the complainant of the right to petition the EEOC to review the MSPB's final decision on the discrimination issue. A dismissal of a mixed case complaint is not appealable to the Commission except where it is alleged that &#x00A7; 1614.107(d) has been applied to a non-mixed case matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(ii)&#x2003;Where the agency or the MSPB administrative judge questions the MSPB's jurisdiction over the appeal on the same matter, the agency shall hold the mixed case complaint in abeyance until the MSPB's administrative judge rules on the jurisdictional issue, notify the complainant that it is doing so, and instruct him or her to bring the allegation of discrimination to the attention of the MSPB. During this period of time, all time limitations for processing or filing under this part will be tolled. An agency decision to hold a mixed case complaint in abeyance is not appealable to EEOC. If the MSPB's administrative judge finds that MSPB has jurisdiction over the matter, the agency shall dismiss the mixed case complaint pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.107(d), and advise the complainant of the right to petition the EEOC to review the MSPB's final decision on the discrimination issue. If the MSPB's administrative judge finds that MSPB does not have jurisdiction over the matter, the agency shall recommence processing of the mixed case complaint as a non-mixed case EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the MSPB has no jurisdiction over disciplinary actions taken against probationary employees, 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A), the erroneous filing of an MSPB appeal by a probationary employee over his termination does not excuse the agency from processing an EEO complaint over that termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Neal v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01821985 (1982). When the Board determines that it does not have jurisdiction over the personnel action involved, "the matter ceases to be a mixed case and may be processed as an ordinary federal sector EEO complaint in order to provide the complainant with a forum for his or her allegation of discrimination." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McWright v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01893025 (1990). Because the Board has no jurisdiction over the demotion of supervisors during their mandatory one-year probationary period, its dismissal of an appeal of such a demotion is not a bar to a subsequent EEO complaint over the demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01903528 (1990). "To hold otherwise would be to deny appellant any administrative forum for an adjudication of her claim of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In a recurring situation, the Merit Systems Protection Board may decide that it does not have jurisdiction over the personnel action and appeal filed before it where there are allegations of discrimination. When the Board dismisses an appeal for lack of jurisdiction, it does not advise the appellant of any right to seek review by the EEOC. In reality, the Commission has no jurisdiction to review a Board decision that does not address discrimination allegations on their merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">To remedy the situation where the appellant is unaware of his or her right to pursue the allegations of discrimination through the EEO administrative process, the Commission has directed that subsequent to the dismissal of a Board appeal on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, any allegations of discrimination must be processed by the agency as a "nonmixed" case, by supplementing whatever investigatory record exists and by issuing a final agency decision with appeal rights to the Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rousseau v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01920410 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a Board appeal raising an issue of discrimination is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, the agency must notify the complainant of his right to contact a counselor and file an EEO complaint. The date of the Board appeal is considered as the date of counselor contact for the purposes of determining timeliness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaMothe v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955527 (1996). If the formal EEO complaint was filed at the time the employee elected to go to the Board, and the appeal is subsequently dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the agency must resume processing of the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Totten v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996665 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to timely contact a counselor after dismissal of an MSPB appeal will be excused where the agency fails to notify the employee of her rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Savage v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A54487 (2006); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05940741 (1995). However, the failure of the agency to notify the employee of the right to seek counseling does not excuse an untimely filing of a formal complaint, where the employee does in fact initiate counseling and then fails to file the formal complaint within 15 days of the notice of final interview. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission also held that when the MSPB dismisses an appeal with an allegation of discrimination on jurisdictional grounds, the employee is not required to file an EEO complaint. The agency must process the allegation on its own as a discrimination complaint. <span class="Italic">See Vannoy v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01953272 (1996). The difference between <span class="Italic">Bell</span> and <span class="Italic">Vannoy</span>, however, has to do with the fact that once the agency does start processing the allegation as a discrimination complaint, the complainant must adhere to the time periods set forth in Part 1614. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Pyc v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 03970010 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the MSPB finds that it does not have jurisdiction over a claim of discrimination raised in a Board appeal, the agency may not dismiss the claim on the basis that the employee never contacted an EEO counselor or filed a formal complaint of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Borghese v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05920734 (1992), the employee filed a Board appeal over the denial by OPM of his disability retirement application. He also alleged that his resignation from the agency was involuntary. In an initial decision, the Board dismissed the employee's claim of involuntary resignation and found it had no jurisdiction over his claim of discrimination in connection with the resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee in <span class="Italic">Borghese</span> then filed an appeal with the EEOC and the case was remanded to determine if the complaint was timely and for acceptance or dismissal. The agency sought reconsideration on the basis that the employee had not filed a formal complaint of discrimination. The Commission found that it was irrelevant that the employee never filed a formal complaint of discrimination. However, the employee must otherwise comply with EEO regulations, including regulations on timeliness. The agency was instructed to consider whether the complaint was timely based on the date on which the employee first raised his claim of discrimination with the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board treats its time period for filing an appeal as a jurisdictional issue. When the Board issues a decision dismissing a case because of the untimely filing of an appeal, it dismisses the appeal as not being within Board jurisdiction. This is true even if the action being appealed is within the Board's jurisdiction. The EEOC has no authority to review Board decisions regarding the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Rollins v. Postmaster General</span>, 03970157 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">The pitfalls of mixed case processing have become apparent to the Commission. The process supposedly eliminates the dual processing of cases and encourages consistency in the decisions of the MSPB and the EEOC. Instead, the subtleties of Board jurisdiction, sometimes confusing to even the seasoned practitioner, result in cases being processed both before the Board and the Commission. Predictably, the delay is endless, and the decisions are often conflicting. Worse still, when the Board dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds and the Commission disagrees with Board's analysis, the Special Panel process, discussed below, cannot be invoked to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nobody is exempt from the confusion engendered by the mixed--case scenario. For example, in <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51491 (2006), <span id="Page_1674"></span>the agency advised the employee that she had the right to appeal her removal to the MSPB. The removal action became effective July 25, 2003. The employee filed a Board appeal on August 25th and contacted an EEO counselor on August 28th. The Board's administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the employee was not a preference--eligible veteran on November 25th and the employee again contacted an EEO counselor on December 19th. The EEOC administrative judge issued a summary judgment decision on the removal finding that the employee's MSPB appeal was untimely and, using the second date of counselor contact, further determined that the employee had not timely initiated counseling and dismissed the complaint. In reversing the decision of its administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Arrendondo, the Commission found:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision also dismissed the EEO complaint for failure to timely seek EEO counseling. The decision noted that the removal action was effective July 25, 2003, and that for purposes of calculating timeliness, the complainant's initial contact with an EEO counselor was on December 19, 2003, beyond the 45 day time limit to seek EEO counseling on the removal. The decision found that the complainant's appeal to the MSPB did not toll the time limit to seek EEO counseling because she did not timely file an appeal with the MSPB. This analysis implies that the AJ was ruling on the timeliness of the removal matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision that the complainant must have failed to timely appeal to the MSPB was in error. Generally, where the MSPB has jurisdiction, the time limit to file an appeal challenging a personnel action is 30 days after the effective date of the action being appealed or 30 days after receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The 30th day after the effective date of the complainant's termination was Sunday, August 24, 2003. MSPB Regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23, which governs the computation of time for appellate submissions, states that if the date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing period will include the first workday after that date, in the instant case, because the 30th day fell on a Sunday, there would be an extension to Monday, August 25, 2003, the date the complainant filed her appeal with the MSPB. Further, the complainant timely sought EEO counseling on August 28, 2003. The complainant only appealed to the MSPB after getting incorrect advice in the removal decision that she had a right to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC only has the authority to review the Board's findings on issues of discrimination over which the Board has jurisdiction. Because of the complexities of mixed case processing and the confusing overlap of Board and EEOC jurisdiction, as well as the fact that many appellants proceed either <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> or with counsel not experienced with federal personnel matters, it is not unusual for complainants to spend months or years in the appeals process and never have their allegations reviewed on the merits. For example, in <span class="Italic">Beltran v. Postmaster General</span>, 03920016 (1992), the Commission held that it</p>
<p class="noindent-1">must determine whether the decision of the Board, with respect to the allegations of discrimination based on handicap, national origin, age, and reprisal constitutes an incorrect interpretation of any applicable law, rule, regulation or policy directive, or is not supported by the evidence in the record as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.414(a), petitions to consider issues of prohibited discrimination may be filed with the Commission by individuals who have been before the MSPB with an appealable matter involving allegations of discrimination, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, mixed cases, and have received a final decision from the MSPB. EEOC and MSPB regulations which provide the framework for processing mixed cases are entwined because of the unique relationship the EEOC and MSPB have with regard to the processing of mixed cases. When issues of discrimination are raised before the Board in conjunction with a merit systems issue, the Commission is empowered to review solely the Board's decision on the discrimination issues<span class="Italic">. Lafayette W. Phillips v. Michael P.W. Stone, Secretary, Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900883 (October 12, 1990). In the present case, the Board held that it did not have jurisdiction to consider petitioner's allegations regarding his 1986 removal because the only appealable matter before it concerned the denial of restoration rights. Consequently, although petitioner at the hearing and throughout the proceedings attempted to argue that his removal was discriminatory based on age, national origin, reprisal, and actual and perceived handicap, the Commission does not have the jurisdiction to review those allegations concerning his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Board dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds, the fact that an employee has exhausted all appeals processes with the Board, including an appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, does not extinguish her right to pursue the matter through the agency's EEO administrative process. <span class="Italic">Brown v. National Science Foundation</span>, 05920511 (1992). Depending on the record that has been developed in the Board proceeding, the agency may, however, not be required to conduct a full investigation of the complaint. Rather, as explained in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, it may be required to simply supplement the Board's record of the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request to reopen, the agency presents the unique procedural posture of this case. The agency claims that given the "mixed" nature of this case, and the fact that appellant exhausted the avenue of appeal that was available to her through the Federal Circuit, the EEOC has no authority to review the matter. Accordingly, the agency argues that continued processing in the agency's EEO process is unwarranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that the agency overlooks one key procedural step when it presents the procedural progression of this case. When the Board made its determination that appellant's resignation was voluntary, it concluded that this was no longer a "mixed case." The Federal Circuit recently agreed with this interpretation of the Board's action in the case of <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240 (Fed. Cir. 1991). <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> also involved the issue of a constructive discharge which was found to be a voluntary resignation by the Board. The court stated that where it is found that there never was an appealable action, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, where the Board determines that the resignation was voluntary, and therefore not tantamount to a removal, the case is not a "mixed" case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1246. The court further noted that, inasmuch as the Board has no jurisdiction over the remaining "naked" claim of discrimination it is not empowered to make a decision on the discrimination issue and provide appeal rights to the Commission. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1245. Nonetheless, in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> the Federal Circuit specifically noted that, the claim of discrimination is not extinguished, "...inasmuch as an appeal from the Board may not be the only route for presentation of Cruz' reprisal 'Title VII' claim, a claim that would appear to fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of a forum other than the Board." <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at p. 1247. For example, the court stated that if a complaint was filed with the Commission, and the Commission dismissed the complaint because the complainant had previously filed with the Board, the Commission could reopen its proceedings on that complaint after the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, the Commission recently gave guidance to agencies in unique cases such as the present case. In the case of <span class="Italic">Leslie Rousseau v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01920410 (January 21, 1991), the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In future such situations where the MSPB finds that it lacks jurisdiction and, in accordance with the decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240 (Fed. Cir. 1991), does not provide an appellant with appeal rights to the Commission, the agency is directed to process the allegation of discrimination as a "non-mixed" case by supplementing the investigatory record, where appropriate, and issuing a FAD with appeal rights to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this law to the present case, the Commission finds that the agency's refusal to process the matter was in error. Indeed, processing appellant's claims of discrimination in the EEO process would not amount to duplicative processing, inasmuch as the Board held no hearing on appellant's discrimination claims, and made no findings on these claims. The Board held, instead, that it was not empowered to address appellant's discrimination claims, inasmuch as they were not accompanied by an appealable action. The Commission therefore finds that the agency should process appellant's complaint at the point processing ceased within the agency. We recognize that a limited hearing was held at the Board; however, as per <span class="Italic">Rousseau</span>, the agency should supplement the record where appropriate as outlined in the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In some ways, mixed cases are simpler when the employee files an appeal with the Board that is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. Because the Commission cannot review the Board's findings on jurisdiction, in those cases, the agency must simply accept the allegations for processing as an EEO complaint, presuming it is otherwise timely. Things can become much more difficult when the employee files an EEO complaint in the first instance. In such situations, the agency or the Commission must determine whether the matter raised is within Board jurisdiction. Of course, neither the determination of the agency nor the Commission that a matter is within Board jurisdiction is binding on the Board. As a result, an agency must generally hold an EEO complaint in abeyance and not dismiss it until the Board has issued a decision on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether an action is within the jurisdiction of the Board, the EEOC first looks to 5 CFR 1201.3 and then to Board case law on the subject. There are instances in which Board jurisdiction is uncertain, such as cases involving "enforced leave." If the Board issues an initial decision dismissing an appeal on jurisdictional grounds, the employee may pursue an EEO complaint at the same time he pursues a petition for review with the MSPB. It is premature for an agency to dismiss such a complaint before the Board issues a decision on the PFR. However, if the Board remands the case for an inquiry into the issue of jurisdiction, the agency may dismiss the complaint. The complaint is subject to being reopened if the Board ultimately rules that it lacks jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 01840561 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission only has the authority to review final decisions of the Board on issues of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.303(a). The Board's decision to dismiss an appeal on the grounds that it lacks jurisdiction is not a final decision within the meaning of the regulation. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01860105 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1675"></span>An agency may not deprive the employee of a forum by dismissing his EEO complaint on the basis that an appeal was filed with the MSPB and then opposing the Board appeal on jurisdictional grounds. <span class="Italic">Morderosian v. General Services Administration</span>, 01841870 (1986). The Commission ruled that the agency erred in dismissing the complaint under these circumstances and further found that because the Board appeal was timely filed the agency should regard the EEO complaint as timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Board restricts the proceedings before it to the issue of whether it has jurisdiction, the agency errs in dismissing a related EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Parson v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01861564 (1987). In that case, the Board determined that as a preliminary matter, it would have to address the question of whether the appellant was a probationary employee without MSPB appeal rights and restricted its decision to that issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order for the mixed case regulations to bar pursuit of an EEO complaint, the Board must actually address the issues raised by the complaint and not merely hear evidence on those issues by way of background to the action before it. In <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01871654 (1987), the Commission reversed the dismissal of a complaint over a performance improvement plan and failure to reassign for poor performance where the MSPB had jurisdiction over the demotion for poor performance. The Commission noted that the issuance of the PIP and the failure to reassign were not within the Board's jurisdiction but only background to the demotion. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Madeley v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01871300 (1987) (Commission found that an EEO complaint over a poor performance appraisal and the Board appeal over denial of a within-grade increase based on the appraisal were separate actions). As noted in the next section on Multiple Personnel Actions, the Commission has reversed its position that a PIP and poor performance evaluation are actions separate from a removal for unacceptable performance. However, the basic point of <span class="Italic">Peterson</span> and <span class="Italic">Madeley</span> remains that an issue raised at the Board for purposes of background evidence does not bar an EEO complaint over that issue. The Board must actually address the issue raised in order to bar an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In reality, when the Board dismisses a case because of lack of jurisdiction, it ceases to be a mixed case. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Bryner v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 03960011 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 4, 1995, Linda A. Bryner, (hereinafter referred to as petitioner) filed a petition with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) asking for review of the Merit Systems Protection Board's (MSPB/Board) final decision issued on her case. The Commission docketed the petition as EEOC Petition No. 03960011. The Commission notes that the MSPB denied jurisdiction of petitioner's case on the grounds that it no longer involved an appealable action. Specifically, the Board held that because the evidence established that appellant voluntarily accepted a downgrade, the Board was divested of appellate jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the MSPB's position denying jurisdiction in such matters, the Commission has held that there is little point in continuing to view the matter as a "mixed case" as defined by 29 CFR 1614.302(a). The case will thus be considered a "non-mixed" matter and processed accordingly. <span class="Italic">See generally Schmitt v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902126 (July 9, 1990); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900883 (October 12, 1990); 29 CFR 1614.302(c)(2)(i) and (ii). Petition No. 03960011 is hereby administratively closed, and the matter is referred to the agency for further processing as outlined below.</p>
