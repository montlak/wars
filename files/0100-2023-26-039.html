<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-40"><span class="space">B.</span> BALANCING TEST</h3>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the participation clause, the opposition clause presents an inherent conflict in protecting the rights of employees to oppose unlawful employment practices and the interests of the agency in maintaining order in the workplace. Resolution of cases involving the opposition clause requires the application of a balancing test that takes into account the interests of both the employee and the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue was first raised in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> where the plaintiff, a civil rights activist, engaged in a "stall in" and "lock in" directed against his employer's alleged discriminatory policies, but he never sought review of the appellate court's findings on the issue of protected activities. However, the EEOC did join with the plaintiff and filed an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief in <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Inc.</span>, 425 F. Supp. 318 (D. Mass. 1976), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976). Although the court did not side with the Commission, <span class="Italic">Hochstadt</span> has become to reprisal cases what <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is to cases of disparate treatment. The Commission cites it often and the case provides a good analysis of the balancing test that must be applied in cases pursued under the opposition clause.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hochstadt</span>, the plaintiff engaged in both public and private activities in opposition to the employer's alleged unlawful practices. The plaintiff, a microbiologist, was hired by the Foundation, along with her husband, to participate in various research projects. Originally, the plaintiff was hired at a salary of $6,000 less than her husband. After an initial protest, the Foundation increased the plaintiff's salary by $3,000 and reduced her husband's salary by the same amount.</p>
<p class="noindent">After working at the Foundation for 18 months, the plaintiff filed complaints of sex discrimination with the EEOC, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, the Department of Labor (under the Equal Pay Act), and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The HEW complaint resulted in implementation of an affirmative action plan at the Foundation, and the discrimination complaint was settled after the issuance of a finding of probable cause.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequent to the resolution of these complaints, the plaintiff began to seek salary information from other employees at the Foundation. She circulated rumors that the Foundation was in jeopardy of losing its federal funding for failure to implement its affirmative action plan, invited an officer of the Association of Women in Science to conduct a covert evaluation of the Foundation, and threatened her supervisors with a lawsuit, unless they sided with her. She also had extensive discussions with a newspaper reporter which resulted in a series of articles about the Foundation in which the salaries of various employees were disclosed. Ultimately, the plaintiff's employment was terminated for "continuing lack of cooperation, disruptive influence, hostility and threats" toward the Foundation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC sided with the plaintiff and argued for an extremely broad interpretation of the opposition clause. The Commission urged the court to reject any balancing test in favor of an interpretation of 704(a) of Title VII that would "immunize" an employee who engaged in any conduct in opposition to unlawful employment practices. The court in <span class="Italic">Hochstadt</span>, 545 F.2d at 230, firmly rejected such an approach:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Certain broad premises can be accepted with confidence. Congress certainly did not mean to grant sanctuary to employees to engage in political activity for women's liberation on company time, and an employee does not enjoy immunity from discharge for misconduct merely by claiming that at all times she was defending the rights of her sex by "opposing" discriminatory practices. An employer remains entitled to loyalty and cooperativeness from employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[M]anagement prerogatives...are to be left undisturbed to the greatest extent possible. Internal affairs of employers...must not be interfered with except to the limited extent that correction is required in discrimination practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additional views on H.R. 7152, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News, p. 2516 (88th Cong., 2d Sess., 1964).</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that it was less than clear to what extent the Act authorized "militant self-help activity," the <span class="Italic">Hochstadt</span> court, 545 F.2d at 231, went on to state:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In such instances, we think courts have in each case to balance the purpose of the Act to protect persons engaging reasonably in activities opposing sexual discrimination, against Congress' equally manifest desire not to tie the hands of employers in the objective selection and control of personnel. (6) Allowing an employee to invoke the protection of Section 704(a) for conduct aimed at achieving purely ulterior objectives, or for conduct aimed at achieving even proper objectives through the use of improper means, could have an effect directly contrary to Congress' goal, by discouraging employers from hiring persons whom the Act is designed to protect....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)...The negative impact of such conduct on the employer, plaintiff observes, is a necessary and unavoidable consequence of the statutory scheme. We doubt that Congress meant to go this far, particularly because an employee who feels that his employer has violated his rights under Title VII may pursue specific state and federal legal remedies for discrimination and need not rely on vigorous internal action directed against the employer.... [W]e find it entirely appropriate to utilize a similar balancing test to determine whether an employee's opposition to employer discrimination in the Title VII context has gone too far.</p>
<p class="noindent">Comparing opposition under Title VII to "concerted activity" under the National Labor Relations Act, the court found a balancing test was the most appropriate means to achieve the purposes of protection of employees rights and the legitimate interests of employers.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has cited <span class="Italic">Hochstadt</span> approvingly for the proposition that opposition to discriminatory practices must not be "unlawful...nor excessively disloyal or hostile or disruptive and damaging to the employer's business." <span class="Italic">Parrish v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05880240 (1988). It also is not necessary that, in opposing such practices, the employee initiate EEO proceedings. A complaint to a congressman falls within the ambit of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Further demonstration of the balancing test used in opposition clause cases was provided in <span class="Italic">Hairgrove v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01913532 (1992), where the complainant received a five-day suspension for discussing a previous EEO complaint involving allegations of sexual harassment with coworkers and agency employees outside of her direct chain of command. The previous complaint had been settled and the complainant had been instructed to maintain the confidentiality of the EEO process by not discussing the allegations with persons outside of her direct chain-of-command.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency defended its actions by indicating that it had a need for confidentiality on EEO matters and that appellant was advised of this need. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hairgrove</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]nitially, the Commission notes that appellant's discussion with co-workers and the individual outside the chain-of-command about the allegations of sexual harassment are an expression of opposition to an alleged unlawful agency practice and thus protected by Title VII. The agency indicated that it ordered appellant upon her initial employment with the office to refrain from discussing its business. Also, the record indicates that appellant was ordered to refrain from discussing her EEO complaint. The record does not establish at the time that it ordered appellant not to discuss her sexual harassment allegations that her discussion of such matters would disrupt the office. However, the agency reasonably concluded that appellant's action compromised the mission of the office, particularly since her discussions violated the confidentiality rule. Thus, it does not appear that the agency unnecessarily interfered with appellant's protected activity. Therefore, the Commission finds that the evidence does not establish that there is a nexus between the order to refrain from discussion [of] sexual harassment allegations that are prior EEO activities. According to the agency, the confidentiality policy was established before the occurrence of appellant's allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission finds that the agency properly balanced the enforcement of its confidentiality requirements against the protection <span id="Page_1490"></span>of appellant's EEO-related activity. The Commission makes this finding because the order was based on an established, necessary office policy and appellant was provided with accessible EEO channels by which to discuss her complaints....</p>
<p class="noindent">In EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at II.A.2.b. (2016), the Commission stresses the reasonableness requirement for opposition activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts and the Commission balance the right to oppose employment discrimination against the employer's need to have a stable and productive work environment. For this reason, the protection of the opposition clause only applies where the manner of opposition is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Complaints to Someone Other Than Employer</span>. "Courts have not limited the scope of the opposition clause to complaints made to the employer; complaints about the employer to others that the employer learns about can be protected opposition." Although opposition typically involves complaints to managers, it may be a reasonable manner of opposition to inform others of alleged discrimination, including union officials, coworkers, an attorney, or others outside the company. For instance, it is protected opposition for an employee to contact the police seeking criminal prosecution of a coworker who engaged in a workplace assault motivated by disability, race, or sex, even though it is not a complaint to a manager or to a government agency that enforces EEO laws.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Complaints Raised Publicly</span>. Depending on the circumstances, calling public attention to alleged discrimination may constitute reasonable opposition, provided that it is connected to an alleged violation of the EEO laws. Opposition may include even activities such as picketing. It includes making informal or public protests against discrimination, "including...writing critical letters to customers, protesting against discrimination by industry or society in general, and expressing support of coworkers who have filed formal charges," provided that it is not done in so disruptive or excessive a manner as to be unreasonable. Moreover, going outside a chain of command or prescribed internal complaint procedure in order to bring forth discrimination allegations may be reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Advising Employer of Intent to File, or Complaining Before Matter is Actionable</span>. It is also a reasonable manner of opposition for an employee candidly to tell the employer of her intention to file a charge with the EEOC or a complaint with a state or local FEPA, union, court, employer's human resources department, higher-level manager, or company CEO. For example, where an employee intends to file an EEOC charge challenging a disparity in pay with a male coworker as sex discrimination, disclosing this to her manager would be protected opposition. Moreover, it is reasonable opposition for an employee to inform the employer about alleged or potential discrimination or harassment, even if the alleged harassment has not yet risen to the level of a "severe or pervasive" hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Examples of Unreasonable Manner of Opposition</span>. On the other hand, it is not reasonable opposition if an employee, for example, makes an overwhelming number of patently specious complaints, or badgers a subordinate employee to give a witness statement in support of an EEOC charge and attempts to coerce her to change that statement. The activity also will not be considered reasonable if it involves an unlawful act, such as committing or threatening violence to life or property. These examples are not exhaustive; whether the manner of opposition is unreasonable is a context- and fact-specific inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Opposition to perceived discrimination also does not serve as license for the employee to neglect job duties. If an employee's protests render the employee ineffective in the job, the retaliation provisions do not immunize the employee from appropriate discipline or discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission focused on the manner in which the petitioner opposed a coworker's nonselection in <span class="Italic">Gia M v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0320130002 (2016). <span class="Italic">Gia M</span>. involved a petitioner, a secretary for the agency's Office of General Counsel, who accessed, printed and provided to an EEO complainant, coworker documents related to the coworker's nonselection. The agency charged the petitioner with unauthorized use of government information and suspended her for 30 days. Before the MSPB, the petitioner argued that the suspension was in retaliation for her opposing a discriminatory selection. The MSPB rejected that argument, sustaining the suspension, and, in particular, noting that the petitioner had no work-related reason to access the at issue documents. Further, that the petitioner purposefully deleted the header containing her name from the documents suggested that she understood their confidential nature. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gia M</span>. agreed, finding that the petitioner's actions did not pass the reasonableness test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that Petitioner did not engage in protected opposition activity because the manner of her opposition was not reasonable. First, we agree with the MSPB that Petitioner knowingly accessed, printed, and provided confidential documents to CW. Specifically, it is undisputed that Petitioner accessed, printed, and provided the documents to CW. In addition, the documentary and the testimonial evidence in the record supports the MSPB's determination that Petitioner was aware of the confidential nature of the information contained in the documents. Second, we emphasize that the Commission explicitly noted, in its Compliance Manual, that courts have found that the following opposition activity was not reasonable and thus not protected: searching and photocopying confidential documents relating to alleged discrimination and showing them to coworkers. We find that Petitioner's actions, i.e., accessing and printing confidential documents relating to alleged discrimination and showing them to CW, were of a similar manner. Accordingly, we find that Petitioner's conduct of accessing, printing, and providing confidential documents to CW did not constitute protected opposition activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gerolamo v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01975955 (1999), the Commission found the complainant was not reasonable in her opposition to the alleged sexual harassment of her husband, who also was an agency employee. The complainant wrote to several agency officials and coworkers, charging that a supervisor had sexually harassed her husband. The letters referred to the supervisor as a "low life," a "conniver," a "liar," and a "piece of garbage." After the complainant was told not to write any more letters by a district manager, she and her husband responded by writing a threatening letter to the manager that was also quite vulgar. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gerolamo</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the manner in which an individual protests perceived employment discrimination must be reasonable in order for the antiretaliation provisions to apply. EEOC Guidance on Investigating, Analyzing Retaliation Claims, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (May 20, 1998). Threats of violence to life or property, making an overwhelming number of complaints based upon unsupported allegations, or bypassing the chain of command in bringing the complaints, is the type of activity which is unreasonable and therefore, not protected by Title VII<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, after a careful review of the record, based on <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Inc.</span>, 425 F. Supp. 318 (D. Mass. 1976), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976) (applying <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> to retaliation cases), we agree with the agency that appellant has failed to prove that her termination was based upon her sex or reprisal. With respect to her claim of reprisal, we find that appellant's actions on behalf of her husband were not protected activity. Specifically, many of the letters appellant sent were directed towards individuals the agency maintains were outside of her husband's chain of command, and who were thus without authority to discipline the examiner for her alleged behavior. Appellant has not provided any evidence to the contrary. The bulk of the evidence reveals that appellant engaged in this letter writing campaign not to oppose any unlawful practice, but rather, as an attempt to discredit the examiner in the eyes of her co-workers. Finally, we note that the September letter, which contains the most egregious language and threats, was sent to the examiner after appellant was directed to send all relevant information only to the Complaint Center. Other than claiming she merely signed the September 1996 letter, appellant has failed to rebut the agency's contention that she was terminated for her involvement in this letter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Harassing and intimidating interactions are not reasonable forms of opposition. In <span class="Italic">William G. v. EEOC</span>, 2019000765 (2020), the Commission concluded that the complainant did not engage in protected opposition activity because his actions intimidated other employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the opposition clause in each of the EEO statutes is broad, the manner in which an individual protests perceived employment discrimination must be reasonable in order for the anti-retaliation provisions to apply. In applying a "reasonableness" standard, courts and the Commission balance the right of individuals to oppose employment discrimination and the public's interest in enforcement of the EEO laws against an employer's need for a stable and productive work environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Public criticism of alleged discrimination may be a reasonable form of opposition; courts have protected an employee's right to inform an employee's customers about the employer's alleged discrimination, as well as the right to engage in peaceful picketing to oppose allegedly discriminatory employment practices. On the other hand, courts have found that certain activities, such as badgering a subordinate employee to give a witness statement in support of an EEOC charge and attempts to coerce her to change that statement were not reasonable, and thus not protected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has found that protected activity consisting of opposition to discrimination must be reasonable in manner. Whether an employee's opposition is reasonable is a context and fact-specific inquiry, in which the right to oppose employment discrimination must be balanced against the employer's need to maintain a stable and productive work environment. <span class="Italic">See Gia M. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320130002 (Aug. 12, 2016) (complainant's accessing and printing confidential documents related to alleged discrimination to show to a coworker was not considered protected EEO activity because it was not reasonable), <span class="Italic">citing Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation</span>, No. 915.004 at II.A.; <span class="Italic">see also Matima v. Celli</span>, 228 F.3d 68, 79 (2d Cir. 2000) (explaining that most circuit courts agree that "disruptive or unreasonable protests <span id="Page_1491"></span>against discrimination are not protected activity under Title VII and therefore cannot support a retaliation claim.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the AJ erred when she found that Complainant's conversations with RAS and PS2 constituted protected activity. While Complainant argued that he engaged in protected activity because he was opposing discrimination against PS1 by Agency officials during these discussions, we find that the record shows that his actions were not reasonable because he engaged in intimidation of other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 testified that RAS reported to her that she felt "ambushed," "harassed," "intimidated" and "threatened" by Complainant. HT at 562. PS2 testified that he felt that Complainant was trying to make him feel guilty about participating in PS1's EEO complaint, and that Complainant was retaliating against him for speaking up. HT at 512. PS2 further testified that he felt that Complainant was trying to dissuade him from providing testimony in PS1's hearing. HT at 514. Therefore, we find that the AJ erred when she held that Complainant's conversations with RAS and PS2, which they reported as intimidating, were reasonable protected activity. However, we accept the AJ's factual finding that S1 was aware of Complainant's prior EEO activity.</p>
