<h3 class="h3" id="sec22-94"><span class="space">W.</span> COSTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress specifically provided for the recovery of costs in Title VII and Rehabilitation Act cases. The Commission incorporated this statutory authority into its regulations at 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(C):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The costs which may be awarded are those authorized by 28 USC 1920 to include: Fees of the reporter for all of any of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses, and fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The regulation at 29 CFR 1614.501(e)(2)(iii) further provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Witness fees shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of 28 USC 1821, except that no award shall be made for a federal employee who is in a duty status when made available as a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent">Costs recoverable are not strictly limited to those items cited in the regulation. In <span class="Italic">Overton v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01902827 (1990), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While our regulation...appears at first reading to limit reimbursement for expenses to the taxable "costs" specified in 28 USC 1920 (witness fees, transcript costs and copying costs), in numerous employment discrimination cases, the courts have rejected government agency assertions that expense awards are limited to those costs expressly cited in our regulation. Rather, the award of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses shall include those incurred by the attorney which are normally charged to a fee-paying client in the normal course of providing representation. <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines</span>, 746 F.2d 4, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 472 U.S. 1021 (1985). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel</span>, 826 F.2d 43, 54 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">reversed on other grounds en banc</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Northcross v. Board of Education</span>, 611 F.2d 624, 639-40 (6th Cir. 1979)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Patricia Hatfield v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01892909 (December 12, 1989). We, therefore, concur with the case law, and allow all expenses claimed...as they appear to be of the sort routinely charged by law firms in the area to fee-paying clients.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Overton</span> case, the costs approved included hotel and air fare expenses for travel by counsel, telephone calls, Lexis computer research usage, and expedited delivery services.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in a cryptic decision given with little analysis, the Commission held that travel expenses, long distance telephone costs, and postage are not recoverable as costs under EEO regulations. Costs include such items as stenographic and printing fees, witness fees and duplication fees. Although the case was decided under Part 1613, the Commission, in a footnote, indicated there was no substantive change in Part 1614 that would affect its interpretation. <span class="Italic">Black v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01921158 (1993). The Commission made no mention of the <span class="Italic">Overton</span> decision and did not specifically overrule that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">It would appear that the <span class="Italic">Black</span> decision simply is an anomaly and was wrongly <span id="Page_2030"></span>decided by the Commission. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hafiz v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 04960021 (1997), the Commission again made it clear that costs are not limited to those enumerated in the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An appellant is not entitled to reimbursement of costs for investigative services. <span class="Italic">Burns v. General Services Administration</span>, 01932480 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to recover costs, the complainant must provide adequate documentation of the costs incurred. <span class="Italic">See Layman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995568 (2002). A mere conclusory recitation of costs is not sufficient. Bills or invoices should be provided and the failure to provide them may result in disallowance of the costs. <span class="Italic">See Lopetrone v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01923930 (1993). The Commission has become much more stringent in requiring documentation to support an award of costs, and now routinely requires receipts, telephone bills and even certified and express mail receipt numbers in support of a motion for costs. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Constant v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01924621 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to adequately document costs will prove fatal to that portion of the fee petition. And, as the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Mareno v. Secretary of Veterans Administration</span>, 01943104 (1996), documentation of costs does not consist merely of a recitation of total costs in the attorney's verified statement of fees and costs; the complainant must provide a detailed explanation of the costs and receipts, if appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that the costs to be awarded are not limited to those set forth in its regulations, but may include other reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the attorney which are normally charged to a fee-paying private client in the normal course of providing representation. <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01892909 (December 12, 1989). However, adequate documentation of the nature and amount of the expense incurred is required in order to receive reimbursement. <span class="Italic">Canady v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890226 (December 27, 1989). For example, failure to submit copies of applicable telephone bills is fatal to a request for reimbursement of toll charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the request for reimbursement of costs is wholly inadequate. For example, AR has requested reimbursement for photocopy costs, but does not indicate the per-page rate charged nor the number of pages photocopied on any given date. AR requested reimbursement for postage, but did not specify what documents were mailed; it should not be up to the agency or the Commission to glean such information from elsewhere in the fee petition. The same may be said for AR's claim for telephone toll charges, for which no bills were submitted. Likewise, although AR clearly incurred travel expenses in connection with her attendance at the administrative hearing, she did not submit copies of her airline ticket receipt, hotel bill, or receipt for ground transportation. Finally, it appears that AR has requested reimbursement for receiving FAXed documents, but has provided no support for the charges. Based upon the foregoing, the Commission denies the request for costs in whole.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Erickson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01944011 (1996) ("The failure to submit copies of applicable telephone bills is fatal to an attorney's request for reimbursement of telephone toll charges."). In the same case, the Commission found that it was reasonable for the agency to use the per copy price of local commercial copy centers where the attorney submitted no evidence of his own per copy costs for copies.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120053186 (2007), the Commission denied over $19,000 in costs, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that receipts for costs, such as postage, shipping, internal photocopies, and on-line subscriptions legal research, may not always be available where a law firm utilizes billing meters and timers. In such a case, however, a verified statement of costs should include: a list of services rendered itemized by date, detailed summary of the task, rate, and, where practicable, the name of the individual performing the task. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110, at 11-9. Furthermore, with respect to long distance phone calls and faxes, we find that, since such charges are memorialized in a monthly telephone bill, a complainant's attorney should be prepared to produce said bill when seeking reimbursement for such costs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, invoices were sent to the agency on a regular basis with the breakdown of costs by category alone. This breakdown, however, failed to provide any itemization of costs by date or rate, and while the invoice included categories, no summary regarding the substance of the task, e.g., 2 copies of January 2003 invoice (6 pages each), was included. Moreover, the invoices submitted contained differing totals for costs claimed. For example, on July 16, 2003, complainant's attorney submitted a bill listing, among other things, $1,706 in "photocopy" costs for March 2003. However, on August 21, 2003, he submitted a second bill for March 2003 costs, which itemized $1,165.85 for "copies." Due to the failure of complainant's attorney to create a verified statement of costs in compliance with EEO MD-110, as well as the billing discrepancies in claims for costs as described in the example above, the Commission finds that the agency properly denied the $19,225 claimed in costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, it appears a complainant should be given an opportunity to document costs prior to dismissal of the claim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960485 (1998), the Commission remanded the case to give the complainant an opportunity to document costs, instead of affirming the agency's decision denying costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Poquiz v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720050095 (2008), the Commission found that almost $3,900 in costs related to litigation were not properly documented. The Commission, however, rejected the agency's argument that only the cost of a deposition transcript should be awarded because it was the only documented costs. It awarded 50% of the requested costs. Although the Commission did not expressly say so, it may be significant in <span class="Italic">Poquiz</span> that the costs were submitted a part of an attorney fee petition and clearly many of the costs claim, such as hearing travel, copying and mailing were legitimate cost items. Still, the Commission was unwilling to accept the representations as to the amount of costs in the fee petition and, ultimately, there is no reason why an attorney should not be able to adequately document such costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kallauner v. Secretary of Energy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a40943.txt">01A40943</a> (2005), the Commission permitted a minor exception to its rule that costs must be documented and allowed the complainant $549.35 in copying costs where the complainant testified he used commercial copying machines that did not provide receipts and the costs appeared reasonable in light of the litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission does not routinely accept new evidence in appeals of fee awards, it will accept such evidence with respect to costs with a showing that the precise costs were not available at the time the petition was filed. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05971058 (1999), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the March submission, counsel sought reimbursement of costs, but noted that these amounts were preliminary, in that, some bills had not been received. On March 15, 1995, counsel amended her claim to show $819 in costs, covering recent depositions and transcripts. In her September submission, counsel added $993.44 in costs for such non-personal expenditures as photocopy costs, online charges, courier service fees, and telephone charges. These charges were not part of the initial submission and likely not available to counsel until several months after the close of the record before the AJ. After a review of these charges and for the reasons stated above concerning the nature of this matter, we do not find these two requests for these charges unreasonable. We find therefore that appellant is entitled to an award of costs in the amount of $819 plus $993.44, or $1,812.44.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that a complainant be represented by an attorney in order to receive an award of costs as the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Carver v. Postmaster General</span>, 04950004 (1996). When an unrepresented complainant makes a request for costs, if supporting documentation is not included in the request, the agency must ask the complainant to provide such documentation. A <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> litigant is entitled to recover the costs of litigation, such as mileage and postage. <span class="Italic">See Bazen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955699 (1996) (an award of costs is appropriate for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> complainant); <span class="Italic">Fiene v. Postmaster General</span>, 04920009 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141551 (2014), holding that costs incurred by non-attorney representatives are recoverable, but denying costs for failure to provide documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a complainant is not required to be represented by counsel in order to obtain an award of costs, he or she will be confined to those costs that are awarded to attorneys. For example, in <span class="Italic">Glaude v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120064851 (2008), the Commission denied the complainant and his non-attorney representative an award of costs for transcription and clerical services because these are items that are built in the hourly rates of attorneys and not separately compensable as costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not reduce travel costs to be awarded to a successful complainant based on the fact that lesser travel expenses may have been incurred by a government employee. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01912990 (1992). The Commission rejected the agency's attempt to award the airfare charged to government employees because the agency had not established that the rate was available to the complainant's counsel as a private citizen.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the same case, the Commission also rejected the agency's attempt to reduce the costs by the amount charged for lodging in connection with one day of depositions. The Commission noted that the attorney drove 325 miles to the depositions and that it was not unreasonable for him to stay overnight before returning home the next day. The Commission did find the agency was not responsible for a parking ticket received by the lawyer during the course of the depositions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892909 (1989), the Commission also approved the appellant's expenses for long distance telephone communications with her attorneys. "[P]revailing plaintiffs should clearly be compensated for reasonable expenses incurred in litigating their claims." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In an interesting case, the Commission upheld the order of an administrative judge to reimburse a witness, or the complainant if he had paid, for roaming charges incurred during telephonic testimony. In <span class="Italic">Hillion v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060065 (2007), the complainant notified the agency representative that one his witnesses would not be available to personally appear at the hearing. <span id="Page_2031"></span>The agency representative, however, made no provision for the witness, who was also a federal employee, to testify by telephone. The witness ultimately testified using his personal cell phone.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Landrum v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720080043 (2009), the Commission rejected an attempt by the complainant to claim travel and parking costs associated with meetings with his attorney as pecuniary damages. The Commission found that the claimed harm did not flow from discrimination but from the EEO process itself and, thus, was not compensable harm.</p>
