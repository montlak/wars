<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-20"><span class="space">B.</span> MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once the employee has demonstrated the existence of a physical or mental impairment or a record of such impairment, the employee must show the impairment substantially limits or limited one or more major life activities. As noted above, there are two separate, but interrelated determinations in this showing: 1) The complainant must show the impairment affects or affected one or more major life activities; and 2) the complainant must show that the effect is or was a substantial limitation. The requirement that the impairment affect a major life activity has the purpose of eliminating minor injuries and ailments from qualifying as disabilities. The requirement that the limitation be substantial has the purpose of eliminating temporary impairments, regardless of their severity, from qualifying as disabilities. In essence, these two requirements serve to limit the protections of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA to permanent or long-lasting impairments that have an important impact on an individual. Although the ADAAA does not change the need for the employee to establish these elements, it does change the level of severity required to establish a disability. The ADAAA does not specifically define "substantial limitation." It did, however, instruct the EEOC to change its regulatory definition of substantial limitation, <span class="Italic">id</span>., Sec. 2(b)(6), and further provides that Supreme Court definitions and previous EEOC definitions of substantial limitation "created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to establish coverage under the ADA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Sec. (b)(5). As previously noted and discussed throughout this chapter, the Commission has now issued its final regulations under 29 CFR Part 1630 implementing the ADAAA. The focus in this section is on defining the major life activities covered under the ADA. The notion of substantial limitation is discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p class="noindent">Congress did not specifically define the term "major life activities" in the original ADA. The EEOC defined the major life activities in its regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2(i) as "functions, such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." The Commission's regulation listing major life activities was not exhaustive. In passing the ADAAA, Congress incorporated the regulatory major life activities into the Statute and expanded the list:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;IN GENERAL--For purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;MAJOR BODILY FUNCTIONS--For purposes of paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.</p>
<p class="noindent">42 USC 12102(2). It is worth noting that the ADAAA definitions of major life activities and major bodily functions are also not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's recently adopted ADA regulations expand on major life activities at 29 CFR 1630.2(i):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general</span>. Major life activities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;The operation of a major bodily function, including functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin; normal cell growth; and digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive functions. The operation of a major bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within a body system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;In determining other examples of major life activities, the term "major" shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability. ADAAA Section 2(b)(4) (Findings and Purposes). Whether an activity is a "major life activity" is not determined by reference to whether it is of "central importance to daily life."</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant demonstrated that the life activity that is limited is one of those specifically delineated in the regulations, the Commission had held that he was not also required to demonstrate that the condition limits his employability<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Veterans Administration</span>, 05840125 (1987). No doubt, this will also hold true for the statutory definitions of a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, it is the complainant who must identify the major life activity or activities that he or she contends are substantially limited. The Commission will not speculate with regard to a major life activity not raised by the complainant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Hardeman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A54232 (2006) (Commission confined itself to analyzing major life activities of performing manual tasks, lifting and working since complainant's testimony and arguments were limited to those activities).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all activities are major life activities. Driving, for example, has not been considered a major life activity. <span class="Italic">Saner v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A13291 (2002). However, it has been regarded as a major component of working as a major life activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dremmel v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060044 (2008) (agency perceived complainant as substantially limited in major life activity of working where it believed home aid could not drive due to medication he was taking). Just as some provisions of the ADAAA were a direct response to Supreme Court decisions, others were a direct response to lower court decisions interpreting the Act. For example, one court held that eating may or may not be a major life activity depending on the circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Fraser v. Goodale</span>, 342 F.3d 1032 (9th Cir. 2003), the court found that eating was a <span id="Page_1107"></span>major life activity where the complainant suffered from Type I diabetes and was insulin-dependent. However, comparing chocolate cake to peanuts, the court observed that a particular food allergy may not affect eating as a major life activity. A person who is restricted only from eating chocolate cake is not limited in a major life activity, the court noted, but one who suffers from a peanut allergy might be because of the trace amounts of peanuts found in numerous foods that can cause severe adverse reactions. Ultimately, the rationale in <span class="Italic">Fraser</span> is faulty. The circumstances do not determine whether eating is a major life activity. Rather, the circumstances determine whether the limitation on eating is substantial.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the ADAAA, the Commission regarded eating as a major life activity. As it explained in <span class="Italic">Jambora v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40128 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In diabetes, the ability to regulate blood sugar levels and metabolize food is impaired, and the individual afflicted with this disorder cannot simply eat whatever or whenever she chooses without concern for the effect on her blood sugar level. That is, to the extent that a diabetic individual must concern herself with the availability of food, the timing of when she eats, and the type and quantity of food she eats, it is the severity of such limitations on the diabetic individual's ability to eat that distinguishes it from simple "dietary restrictions." <span class="Italic">See Lawson v. CSX Transportation, Inc.,</span> 245 F.3d 913 (7th Cir. 2001). Here, we find that because the record reflects that complainant, in addition to strict attention to what and when she eats, must also constantly monitor her blood sugar level and take insulin, this is sufficient to demonstrate that complainant's diabetes affects the major life activity of "eating."</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Jambora</span> case is discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-23-021.html#sec14-22">Major Bodily Functions</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has significantly supplemented its regulatory definition of major life activities and major bodily functions in the appendix that accompanies Part 1630. As the Commission notes in that guidance, the definition of major life activities should be broadly interpreted consistent with the overall mandate of the ADAAA and that there was something "inherently illogical" in having a court struggle with the question of whether the HIV virus substantially limited any major life activity of a small child:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADAAA provided significant new guidance and clarification on the subject of "major life activities." As the legislative history of the Amendments Act explains, Congress anticipated that protection under the ADA would now extend to a wider range of cases, in part as a result of the expansion of the category of major life activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 8 n.17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of clarity, the Amendments Act provides an illustrative list of major life activities, including caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. The ADA Amendments expressly made this statutory list of examples of major life activities non-exhaustive, and the regulations include sitting, reaching, and interacting with others as additional examples. Many of these major life activities listed in the ADA Amendments Act and the regulations already had been included in the EEOC's 1991 now-superseded regulations implementing title I of the ADA and in sub-regulatory documents, and already were recognized by the courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA as amended also explicitly defines "major life activities" to include the operation of "major bodily functions." This was an important addition to the statute. This clarification was needed to ensure that the impact of an impairment on the operation of a major bodily function would not be overlooked or wrongly dismissed as falling outside the definition of "major life activities" under the ADA. 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 16; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 8 ("for the first time [in the ADAAA], the category of 'major life activities' is defined to include the operation of major bodily functions, thus better addressing chronic impairments that can be substantially limiting").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The regulations include all of those major bodily functions identified in the ADA Amendments Act's non-exhaustive list of examples and add a number of others that are consistent with the body systems listed in the regulations' definition of "impairment" (at &#x00A7; 1630.2(h)) and with the U.S. Department of Labor's nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity regulations implementing section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, 29 U.S.C. 2801, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. Thus, special sense organs, skin, genitourinary, cardiovascular, hemic, lymphatic, and musculoskeletal functions are major bodily functions not included in the statutory list of examples but included in &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(ii). The Commission has added these examples to further illustrate the non-exhaustive list of major life activities, including major bodily functions, and to emphasize that the concept of major life activities is to be interpreted broadly consistent with the Amendments Act. The regulations also provide that the operation of a major bodily function may include the operation of an individual organ within a body system. This would include, for example, the operation of the kidney, liver, pancreas, or other organs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The link between particular impairments and various major bodily functions should not be difficult to identify. Because impairments, by definition, affect the functioning of body systems, they will generally affect major bodily functions. For example, cancer affects an individual's normal cell growth; diabetes affects the operation of the pancreas and also the function of the endocrine system; and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection affects the immune system. Likewise, sickle cell disease affects the functions of the hemic system, lymphedema affects lymphatic functions, and rheumatoid arthritis affects musculoskeletal functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the legislative history of the ADAAA, Congress expressed its expectation that the statutory expansion of "major life activities" to include major bodily functions (along with other statutory changes) would lead to more expansive coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 8 n.17 (indicating that these changes will make it easier for individuals to show that they are eligible for the ADA's protections under the first prong of the definition of disability). The House Education and Labor Committee explained that the inclusion of major bodily functions would "affect cases such as <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Happy Time Day Care Ctr.</span> in which the courts struggled to analyze whether the impact of HIV infection substantially limits various major life activities of a five-year-old child, and recognizing, among other things, that `there is something inherently illogical about inquiring whether' a five-year-old's ability to procreate is substantially limited by his HIV infection; <span class="Italic">Furnish v. SVI Sys., Inc,</span> in which the court found that an individual with cirrhosis of the liver caused by Hepatitis B is not disabled because liver function--unlike eating, working, or reproducing--'is not integral to one's daily existence'; and <span class="Italic">Pimental v. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic,</span> in which the court concluded that the plaintiff's stage three breast cancer did not substantially limit her ability to care for herself, sleep, or concentrate. The Committee expects that the plaintiffs in each of these cases could establish a [substantial limitation] on major bodily functions that would qualify them for protection under the ADA." 2008 House Education and Labor Committee Report at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The examples of major life activities (including major bodily functions) in the ADAAA and the EEOC's regulations are illustrative and non-exhaustive, and the absence of a particular life activity or bodily function from the examples does not create a negative implication as to whether an omitted activity or function constitutes a major life activity under the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 8; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 2008 House Committee on Educ. and Labor Report at 11; 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission anticipates that courts will recognize other major life activities, consistent with the ADA Amendments Act's mandate to construe the definition of disability broadly. As a result of the ADA Amendments Act's rejection of the holding in <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams</span>, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), whether an activity is a "major life activity" is not determined by reference to whether it is of "central importance to daily life." <span class="Italic">See Toyota</span>, 534 U.S. at 197 (defining "major life activities" as activities that are of "central importance to most people's daily lives"). Indeed, this holding was at odds with the earlier Supreme Court decision of <span class="Italic">Bragdon v. Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624 (1998), which held that a major life activity (in that case, reproduction) does not have to have a "public, economic or daily aspect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 639.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the regulations provide that in determining other examples of major life activities, the term "major" shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 7 (indicating that a person is considered an individual with a disability for purposes of the first prong when one or more of the individual's "important life activities" are restricted) (citing 1989 Senate Report at 23). The regulations also reject the notion that to be substantially limited in performing a major life activity, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing "activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 5 n.12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, for example, lifting is a major life activity regardless of whether an individual who claims to be substantially limited in lifting actually performs activities of central importance to daily life that require lifting. Similarly, the Commission anticipates that the major life activity of performing manual tasks (which was at issue in <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>) could have many different manifestations, such as performing tasks involving fine motor coordination, or performing tasks involving grasping, hand strength, or pressure. Such tasks need not constitute activities of central importance to most people's daily lives, nor must an individual show that he or she is substantially limited in performing all manual tasks.</p>
