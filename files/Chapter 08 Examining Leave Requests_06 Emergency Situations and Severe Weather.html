<section>
<h2 class="h2">EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND SEVERE WEATHER</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Emergency situations always seem to arise at the worst possible times. Whether the situation is weather-related or man-made, there are steps you can take to keep employees safe and return facilities to normal operations as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Emergency Dismissal Protocol calls for the General Services Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Office of Personnel Management to consult and decide on the operating status of the federal government and federal buildings during an emergency. These agencies have ongoing access to critical information provided by the Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement, and other agencies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a natural disaster or other emergency, FEMA, GSA, and OPM will convene their principals for a review of the situation and make decisions for each of their respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Immediate notification of changes to the operating status of the federal government will be relayed to key federal and local authorities. Following this notification, the news media, the Federal Executive Board, and outlets across the National Capital Region and the nation will be alerted to the change in operational status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency's HR department will be the place to contact for the most updated information in an emergency. If you can't get specific information from your HR office, the operating status of the federal government is always available on the OPM website.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Emergency dismissal</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">When an emergency dismissal is authorized, make sure your employees are dismissed relative to their normal departure times from work. For example, if a three-hour early dismissal is announced as a result of a snowstorm or hurricane, workers who normally leave their offices at 5 p.m. would be authorized to leave at 2 p.m. Workers who normally leave at 6 p.m. would be authorized to leave at 3 p.m.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency may allow you to exempt individual employees from authorized dismissal times under this policy to avoid hardships (e.g., when younger children are released early from school and no alternative forms of childcare are available to the employee). When individual employees are exempted from authorized dismissal times, no leave should be charged to the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Remember:</b> As in any circumstance, federal employees must follow your orders during emergency situations. Just as in nonemergency situations, failure to follow orders may subject the employee to discipline, up to and including removal.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Emergency management</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>"Emergency employees" and "mission-critical" emergency employees.</b> Work with your agency to designate "emergency employees" who are critical to agency operations in dismissal or closure situations. In addition, agencies will usually identify a core group of "mission-critical emergency employees" who might be activated during emergencies involving national security, extended emergencies, or other unique situations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employees who are prevented from reporting for work or who experience unanticipated short-term commuting delays.</b> Without prior approval from OPM, managers may grant excused absences to employees who are prevented from reporting for work because of emergency conditions or unanticipated short-term commuting delays. For example, if an employee is unable to report for work due to security measures, congested roads, disruption of power or water, or interruption of public transportation, a manager can use discretionary authority to excuse the employee from work without charge to leave or loss of pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Excused absences should be granted only for short periods of time. Unless otherwise instructed, "emergency employees" are expected to report for work. Managers should always check with their HR staffs to work out the details of these arrangements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employees who experience long-term commuting delays.</b> Employees may experience delays in reaching and entering their work sites for extended periods due to emergency or hazardous situations or heightened security measures. In these situations, employees should anticipate longer, more difficult commutes and should take appropriate action to ensure they are able to report for work on time. In the alternative, they may request annual leave, other paid time off, or leave without pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employees who are directed not to report for work for emergencies of short duration.</b> In the event of severe hazardous conditions, disruption of public services, or other emergency situations of short duration, you may instruct employees not to report for work. If an employee is prevented from working because they have been instructed by authorized officials not to report for work, the employee normally will be excused from work without loss of pay or charge to leave. Check with HR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You may wish to consider use of alternative work sites, where appropriate and feasible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Changing employees' work schedules.</b> During emergency situations, an agency may need to change employees' work schedules to meet its mission requirements. Typically, an employee's tour of duty must be scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek and must consist of five consecutive workdays, with the same working hours each day. However, the head of an agency may change an employee's work schedule without regard to these requirements as long as the changes are consistent with applicable laws and regulations and the agency follows the negotiated collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Weather and safety leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies have the discretion to provide a separate type of paid leave when weather or other safety-related conditions prevent employees from safely traveling to or safely performing work at an approved location due to an act of God, terrorist attack, or other applicable condition. Weather and safety leave is a provision of the Administrative Leave Act of 2016, which is part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017. This is an excused absence from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave. Managers and their agencies may grant weather and safety leave without prior OPM approval.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employees covered.</b> Agencies may approve weather and safety leave for the following employees:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Most Title 5 civilian employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, registered nurses, physician assistants, expanded-duty dental auxiliaries, and chiropractors employed by the Veterans Health Administration under Title 38.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Intermittent employees who do not have an established regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek may not be granted weather and safety leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Work closely with your agency's HR office in deciding whether to approve weather and safety leave for an employee or group of employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Telework and remote work employees.</b> Teleworkers and remote workers who are able to safely travel to and work at approved telework sites generally may not be granted weather and safety leave. Teleworkers are typically able to safely perform work at their approved telework sites (e.g., homes) since they are not required to work at their regular work sites.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, your agency may provide leave if the weather or safety conditions could not reasonably be anticipated, and the employee was not able to prepare for telework and is unable to perform work at the telework site. If the employee cannot work safely at the telework site due to weather or safety conditions applicable to the telework site, your agency has the discretion to grant weather and safety leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency does not have to provide leave if the weather or safety conditions do not prevent the employee from safely traveling to or safely performing work at a regular work site even if the affected day is a scheduled telework day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When deciding whether to grant leave to a teleworker, you must evaluate whether:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The weather or safety conditions could be reasonably anticipated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee took reasonable steps to prepare to telework at the telework site.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is unable to perform work at a telework site because they failed to make necessary preparations for reasonably anticipated conditions, you may not provide weather and safety leave, and the employee would need to use other appropriate paid leave, paid time off, or leave without pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If having a child or other person requiring the presence of a caregiver in the home diminishes an employee's ability to perform their duties via telework during official hours of work, the employee may not be eligible to work under these conditions. It may be possible for an employee on a flexible work schedule to take unpaid breaks to attend to non-work responsibilities, which could enable the employee to be fully productive during claimed hours of work. Or an employee could be allowed to take leave or other paid time off to cover periods during scheduled working hours the employee is unable to perform their duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If agency policy allows the employee to telework when a young child or other person requiring the presence of a caregiver is present in the home, any time spent providing care to that person would not be considered hours of work. The employee would be expected to account for their scheduled tour of duty and take the appropriate leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (e.g., previously earned credit hours or compensatory time off) to account for the time spent away from normal work-related duties. The agency should not grant the employee weather and safety leave for the non-work time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Emergency employees.</b> Your agency may designate emergency employees who are critical to agency operations and for whom weather and safety leave may not be applicable. Agencies should inform these employees of their designation as emergency employees well in advance in anticipation of the possible occurrence of the weather or safety conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It's wise to encourage an emergency employee to enter into a telework agreement because you'll cover the possibility that the employee could work from an approved telework site in lieu of traveling to the regular work site in appropriate circumstances. Emergency employees must report to work at their regular work sites or other approved locations as directed by the agency unless:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The agency determines that travel to or performing work at the work sites is unsafe for emergency employees, in which case the agency may require the employees to work at other locations, including approved telework sites.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The agency determines that circumstances justify granting weather and safety leave.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee who is required to work fails to report for work without adequate reason for their absence, the agency may place the employee on absence without leave, and the employee may potentially be disciplined for AWOL by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If operations are disrupted and offices are closed for an extended period of time, an agency may determine that changing circumstances require non-emergency employees to report for work. Agencies should establish a procedure for notifying and recalling these employees. Agencies should identify non-emergency employees who are expected to remain in contact with their agencies at all times during dismissal or closure situations to maintain continuity readiness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Administering leave.</b> When granting weather and safety leave, the same minimum charge increments must be used that are in place for annual and sick leave. Unless an agency establishes a minimum charge of less than one hour or establishes a different minimum charge through negotiations, the minimum charge for leave is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees may not receive weather and safety leave for hours during which they are on other preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or paid time off. In addition, employees may be granted weather and safety leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charging annual and sick leave when absent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee was not expected to report to duty during a period for which weather and safety leave might otherwise have been authorized, there is generally no need for the agency to provide weather and safety leave to relieve the employee from their obligated workday. However, supervisors may request sufficient information or documentation to show that granting weather and safety leave is appropriate -- for example, documentation that the same weather/safety event caused cancellation of travel plans or of a doctor's appointment.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Severe weather flexibilities</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">During severe weather emergencies, such as hurricanes, floods, and major snowstorms, you have a number of flexibilities available to accommodate the emergency needs of employees and their families. To avoid placing employees in unnecessary danger and to allow for overtime when it is required to deal with the effects of weather emergencies, managers should work closely with their agency's HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency should have policies in place for the following list of flexibilities and benefits authorized by OPM:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Weather and safety leave.</b> This type of leave enables managers and their agencies to have the discretion to excuse employees from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave and without needing to obtain prior OPM approval. However, since many employees are required to telework on closure days, OPM does not advise agencies to cancel an employee's preapproved paid leave and automatically grant the employee weather and safety leave on a day when federal offices are closed.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Paid time off.</b> If your agency has not approved weather and safety leave, employees may request annual leave or sick leave, or if appropriate, advance annual or sick leave or donated leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Emergency leave transfer program.</b> The president may direct OPM to establish a leave transfer program that would allow employees to donate unused leave to employees in their agencies and in other agencies affected by an emergency if weather and safety leave has not been approved.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Advance payments.</b> Agencies may authorize advance payments, evacuation payments, and payments for travel and subsistence expenses to employees who have been ordered to evacuate from their homes.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Telework and alternative work schedules.</b> AWS and telework can help employees balance work and personal responsibilities. In emergencies, agencies may continue to designate the location of the employee's reporting office prior to the emergency as the official work site for location-based pay entitlements such as locality pay and special rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Emergency employees and teleworkers</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">During an emergency, it's important for you and your agency to be clear in your communications about continuity of operation plans and telework arrangements. It is essential that every employee in your work unit knows and understands what to do when your office closes. They must be able to act immediately and in accordance with established procedures when unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave are options, or when they are required to telework when your agency or office is closed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM has procedures for how to handle emergency closings of federal agencies within the Washington Capital Beltway. Facilities outside of the Beltway are allowed to develop their own emergency plans, but OPM retains the right to issue guidelines affecting those areas as well in rare circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employee categories during an emergency closure.</b> When an emergency closure is announced, employees generally will fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Emergency employees required to work.</b> Emergency employees generally are required to report for duty and must follow the normal time and attendance rules. In limited circumstances, an excused absence is possible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Telework-ready employees required to work.</b> Generally, two types of telework-ready employees must perform work on closure days -- employees already scheduled to perform telework and employees under a written telework agreement that requires them to telework during a government closure. For the latter, written telework agreements, consistent with agency policies and subject to any collective bargaining agreement provisions, must be in place. If your agency does not require the telework-ready employee to work, then the employee must follow normal time and attendance rules. In limited circumstances, an excused absence is possible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Telework-ready employees not scheduled or required to work.</b> Some telework-ready employees will not be scheduled to telework or under a telework agreement requiring them to work. These employees are subject to the normal time and attendance rules. For a more comprehensive telework policy and a larger workforce in place, you may want to consider incorporating these individuals into the group of employees who have written telework agreements requiring them to telework during closures subject to agency policies and any collective bargaining agreements.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Nonemergency employees not required to telework.</b> These employees generally receive an excused absence, which will be announced by the agency or by OPM. Employees on an alternative work schedule day off, on leave without pay, or on travel outside the affected area are generally not granted an excused absence.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Failure to follow policy.</b> You may encounter instances where employees disregard agency rules or efforts to communicate during an emergency situation. Some employees may even fail to perform their duties or follow proper procedures when required to work. After researching each incident and consulting with HR, you may pursue disciplinary measures against employees who fail to follow policy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Emergencies often prevent consistent access to phone or electricity, so you should try to communicate repeatedly or through alternate channels with the employee. Document your attempts so you'll have a record of what happened to rely on after the emergency passes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Annual checkup.</b> Your agency, office, or work unit could benefit from an annual examination of your internal policies for emergencies. Work with HR to involve all employees in the review process because they can provide insights from their unique situations. Staff involvement in policy examination will ensure they review it and the feedback you get will be invaluable in fashioning a comprehensive policy.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Restoration of excess annual leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM has issued interim regulations to assist agencies and employees responding to national emergencies with the scheduling of annual leave. The interim regulations became effective Aug. 10, 2020.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees who would forfeit annual leave in excess of the allowable maximum annual leave carryover limit because of the importance of their work to support the nation during a national emergency will have their excess annual leave deemed to have been scheduled in advance and subject to leave restoration. The regulations also set up a streamlined process for the declaration of such an exigency of public business as well as its termination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The forfeited annual leave must be restored subject to the following time limits:</p>
<table class="table-3s">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="td1"><p class="Body-Text"><b>Full-time employees</b></p></td>
<td class="td1"><p class="Body-Text"><b>Employee on uncommon tour of duty</b></p></td>

<td class="td1">
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Excess annual leave of 416 hours or less must be scheduled and used by the end of the leave year in progress two years after the termination date of exigency of the public business.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> This period must be extended by one leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td class="td1"><ul class="bull"><li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> For these employees, the conversion rules regarding the referenced numbers of hours for full-time employees (416 hours and 208 hours) must be applied.</li></ul></td>
<td class="td1">
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Excess annual leave in an amount equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty must be scheduled by the end of the leave year in progress two years after the termination date of the exigency of the public business.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> This period must be extended by one leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="Body-Text">These time limits <i>do not</i> apply for the entire period during which an employee's services have been deemed essential for the response to the national emergency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Forfeited annual leave.</b> For any covered employee who forfeits annual leave at the beginning of a leave year, the forfeited annual leave is deemed to have been scheduled in advance. This is because annual leave must be scheduled in writing before the start of the third biweekly pay period prior to the end of the leave year to be considered for restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>National emergency process.</b> The interim regulations also set up the process to be followed when a national emergency triggering an exigency of the public business determination by OPM is made. Your agency must establish and update procedures to administer this authority so that the policies are in place and immediately available for use any time the OPM director notifies agencies of an exigency of the public business determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The steps of this process are as follows:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> The president declares a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> The OPM director deems the national emergency to be an exigency of the public business for the purpose of restoring forfeited annual leave.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Each agency head must then identify the specific employees or groups of employees who are performing services that are essential in responding to the national emergency and who are thus qualified for coverage. This determination may not be made by any official whose leave would be affected by the determination. The agency head must inform these employees of the determination and that this authority applies to them.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Each agency head must monitor the agency response to the national emergency and determine whether the services of individual employees or groups of employees continue to be essential for the response such that annual leave may not be scheduled according to normal procedures.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">5.</span> Each agency head must fix the termination date of the exigency of the public business for each employee or group of employees. The exigency must be terminated on the date one of the following events occurs, whichever is earliest:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="bull-b1">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The president declares an end to the national emergency.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The OPM director deems the national emergency to no longer be an exigency of the public business.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An agency head determines that the services of an employee or group of employees are no longer essential to the response or that the employees are able to follow the normal leave scheduling procedures.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> 12 months have passed since the national emergency was declared. An agency head may extend this deadline by an additional 12 months, limited to two 12-month extensions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When an employee whose services were determined to be essential during the national emergency moves to a position not involving essential services.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">6.</span> Once a termination date has been set for the exigency, each affected employee must make a reasonable effort to comply with the advance scheduling requirement. The agency head may exempt employees from the requirement if their coverage by this authority terminated during the leave year and they were unable to comply with the advance scheduling requirement because of circumstances beyond their control.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3">Emergency leave and pay</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">You should inform your employees that whether agencies charge leave or grant excused absence when an emergency develops during normal work hours depends on whether the employee is on duty, scheduled to report for work, or on leave at the time of dismissal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">These points govern early dismissal:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Agencies will usually not charge leave but grant excused absence for employees on duty at the time an early dismissal is announced. An excused absence is appropriate for the remainder of the workday following the employee's authorized time of dismissal even if the employee is scheduled to take leave later in the day.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees who must leave work earlier than their official early dismissal times will be charged annual leave or leave without pay from the time of their departure through the remainder of their scheduled workday. Employees on preapproved leave should continue to be charged leave until the date they are scheduled to return to duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When an employee is scheduled to return from leave after the announcement of an adjusted work dismissal policy, but before the authorized departure time, you should grant excused absence for the remainder of the workday following the time of the official announcement even if the employee is scheduled to take leave later in the day.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When an employee is absent on previously approved annual leave, sick leave, or LWOP for the entire workday, the agency should continue to charge the employee leave for the entire workday.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Normally, when an employee is scheduled to report for work before the authorized dismissal time but fails to do so, the agency should charge annual leave, sick leave, or LWOP, as appropriate, for the entire workday. Exceptions to this policy should be made only in unusual circumstances.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You may grant excused absence to employees who are scheduled to report for work after an early dismissal policy is officially announced. An excused absence is appropriate for the remainder of the workday even if an employee is scheduled to take leave later in the day. An agency may also excuse an employee without loss of pay or charge to leave (i.e., grant a reasonable amount of excused absence) to avoid hardships (e.g., when younger children are released from school or childcare centers earlier than the announced dismissal time, and no alternative forms of childcare are available). However, employees have no entitlement to excused absence.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">You should follow your agency's guidance on emergency preparedness and discuss any issues with agency officials.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Overtime pay.</b> In an emergency, you should be aware that your employees may be restricted to the agency's premises for periods that extend beyond their normal tours of duty. Most employees will not be entitled to any additional pay for this extended period. However, employees who are required to remain in a state of readiness to perform work during this extended period may be entitled to overtime pay for standby duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The key issue in determining whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay for standby duty is the nature of the restrictions placed on the employee. Check with HR.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Your role during an emergency situation requires great attention to detail. Here are some tips on how to handle these situations.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Do not:</h3>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Hesitate.</b> An emergency plan should be in place prior to the emergency. It's never too early to inquire. However, it can be too late if you continue to wait until an emergency arises.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Have employees report when not necessary.</b> It may seem obvious, but remember that emergency plans are established for the safety of your workers and yourself. Don't put your employees in harm's way if it is unnecessary.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Disregard your COOP.</b> Most agencies have a continuity of operations plan for use in a variety of emergencies. The COOP is designed to maintain essential operations with employees designated essential and may designate alternate work sites or rely on telework. Make sure you and your employees review it and know what they need to do before there is a crisis.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to consult HR.</b> Your job is to be the connection between the agency heads and your employees. When emergency situations arise, make sure that you understand the situation and follow through by speaking to your agency's HR staff.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What should I do when an emergency dismissal is authorized?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> When an emergency dismissal is authorized, you should dismiss your employees relative to their normal departure times from work. For example, if a two-hour early dismissal is announced as a result of an emergency, workers who normally leave their offices at 5 p.m. would be authorized to leave at 3 p.m. Workers who normally leave at 6 p.m. would be authorized to leave at 4 p.m.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can an employee receive overtime pay in emergency situations?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> In an emergency, your employees may be restricted to the agency's premises for periods that extend beyond their normal tours of duty. Most employees will not be entitled to any additional pay for this extended period. However, employees who are required to remain in a state of readiness to perform work during this extended period may be entitled to overtime pay for standby duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Should I tell an employee to not report for work if hazardous conditions are present?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Your agency will have a procedure in place for this issue. In most cases, when there are severe hazardous conditions, disruption of public services, or other emergency situations of short duration, you may instruct employees not to report for work. If an employee is prevented from working because they have been instructed by an authorized official not to report for work, the employee normally will be excused from work without loss of pay or charge to leave. It's always a good idea to first consult with your boss and/or HR when making a decision to allow employees not to report to work in these situations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Is it possible for a manager to set up a telework situation for an employee?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Check with your agency's continuity of operations plan. In cases of emergency or hazardous situations, you may wish to consider the use of alternative work sites, where appropriate and feasible. However, unless otherwise instructed, "emergency employees" are expected to report for work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can a manager make changes in work schedules during emergency situations without negotiating first?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Typically, an employee's tour of duty must be scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek and must consist of five consecutive workdays, with the same working hours each day. However, the head of an agency may change an employee's work schedule without regard to these requirements as long as the changes are consistent with applicable laws and regulations and the agency follows the negotiated collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.</p>
