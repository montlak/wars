<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-125"><span class="space">K.</span> FUTURE PECUNIARY DAMAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The largest problem with future pecuniary damage awards is that, by definition, they involve a certain degree of speculation. The fact that there is some speculation involved does not preclude a future pecuniary damage award. If that were the case, future pecuniary damages would never be awarded. As a result, future pecuniary damage awards involve trying to sift out actual reliable speculative evidence from mere speculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most future pecuniary damage awards have involved expenses for future <span id="Page_1822"></span>medical treatment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01971161 (2000). As a general rule, in such cases, the Commission requires medical evidence of the need for future treatment. Such evidence must be reasonably specific about the need for the treatment, the course of treatment, and its anticipated duration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Klein v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01982146 (2000) (the mere assertion of a physician that the complainant would require treatment for some unspecified duration was insufficient to sustain an award of future pecuniary damages).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a muddled decision in <span class="Italic">Winkler v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01975336 (2000), the Commission ordered the agency to pay $15,000 in future pecuniary damages for two years of additional psychiatric treatment. In that case, the appeal was decided more than two years after the complainant submitted evidence on damages and she had already received the two additional years of treatment. But, the agency had denied payment for that treatment in the form of past pecuniary damages. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Winkler</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requests $15,000.00 in future pecuniary damages for continued psychiatric treatments. In its FAD, the agency stated that it found no basis to award future pecuniary damages. Specifically, the agency states that while, in 1994, Psychiatrist B stated that complainant needed an additional two years of psychiatric treatment, the record indicates that from 1994 to 1996, complainant actually received an additional two years of treatment from Psychiatrist C and thus has not demonstrated the need for future treatments. However, Psychiatrist C was the practitioner that the agency refused to accept as a treating physician or to award past pecuniary damages because complainant failed to provide a medical report. Since complainant submitted all of her compensatory damages evidence in 1994, when the agency original requested the information, the agency cannot now state that complainant cannot receive an award for future treatment because she in fact received treatment after 1994. For purposes of this decision, we find that the last medical report regarding compensatory damages was Psychiatrist B's March 31, 1994 report which recommended that complainant receive an additional two years of treatments. He estimated the cost at $15,000.00 and stated that this treatment was necessary to repair the severe damage caused by her work experiences with the agency. Accordingly, we order the agency to pay complainant $15,000.00 in future pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem with the <span class="Italic">Winkler</span> decision is that the Commission does not make it clear whether the award is for two additional years of treatment or for the two years of treatment already administered.</p>
<p class="noindent">A far trickier issue than future medical treatment, however, involves the treatment of claims for loss of future earning potential.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thus far, the Commission has not awarded much in the way of future pecuniary damages. Some insight, however, is provided by <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Postmaster General</span>, 05980429 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant presented medical evidence establishing that she is unable to return to work at the agency as a direct result of the unlawful discrimination. Appellant also submitted evidence to establish her economic loss. A Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist (VRS) evaluated the jobs outside of the agency that appellant could qualify for and do given her skills and experience at that time. The VRS identified three types of clerk positions and an Office Manager position, paying from $20,400 to $42,474 per year. Because appellant had begun working towards a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, the VRS also indicated that appellant would be eligible for several other positions ranging from $24,000 to $45,600 per year if she completed her degree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VRS' findings were forwarded to an Economist. Using life expectancy tables, the Economist assumed that appellant would continue working until the year 2018 when she reaches age 65. The Economist determined the following: (1) appellant's wages had she continued to work for the agency, less taxes and other deductions; (2) appellant's mitigating income from other work based on the VRS' data regarding other work for which she presently was qualified; and (3) losses with respect to the Thrift Savings Plan and Retirement Benefits. Using a net discount rate to adjust for inflation and present value, the Economist determined appellant's future loss to be $759,116.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The findings of the VRS and the Economist differ markedly in premise. The VRS took into account the facts that appellant's prospects were not necessarily limited to hourly-wage jobs, and that appellant's continuing education would afford her other, better paying career options. For example, the VRS identified several hourly-wage jobs that appellant could fill immediately (such as General Office Clerk), but also identified several higher-salaried positions appellant could fill in the future (such as Social Worker or Personnel Manager). By contrast, the Economist depicted a "worst case" scenario in which appellant's prospects would be limited to the lower-paying hourly-wage jobs, without regard to appellant's pursuit of a college degree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the reports of the VRS and the Economist, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to compensation for loss of earning capacity through the year 2000, a period of roughly six years from when appellant stopped work. All indications in the record are that by the year 2000, appellant will have completed her education and re-entered the work force. Beyond the year 2000, the substantial number of variables involved in assessing appellant's continuing loss of wage-earning capacity, if any, simply become too speculative. Ordering the agency to compensate appellant for her economic loss through the year 2000 therefore fully expresses the agency's responsibility in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Economist's report, the amount of appellant's economic losses through the year 2000 totals $152,034. This amount represents the difference between what appellant's wage-earning capacity prior to the injury inflicted by the discrimination and her wage-earning capacity subsequent to the injury (salary as an agency employee less expected salary in new employment). The agency will be ordered to pay appellant this amount as future pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to extract much definitive law on the subject of future pecuniary damages from the <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> decision. Obviously, though, not much in the way of future pecuniary damages is likely to be awarded in the absence of expert testimony on the issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">A claim that discrimination has resulted in a missed promotion is not a claim for pecuniary damages, but a claim for equitable relief. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Winston v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01972099 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant explains that these losses consist of his "loss of career opportunities and his loss of opportunities for career advancement." He further opines that his entitlement to these damages may be inferred from the career advancement of the person selected (selectee) for the County Supervisor position that complainant was denied. Complainant argues that both he and the selectee were GS-9s prior to the selection. The promotion resulted in the selectee's advancement to the GS-12 County Supervisor position. The selectee served in this position for one year and requested military leave for approximately one year to attend school. Upon completion of school, the selectee returned to the agency and was assigned to the agency's state office as a Farmer Program Specialist. The selectee is presently a GS-12 Loan Resolution Task Force Specialist. Complainant contends that absent the discriminatory personnel action, he would have similarly risen to a GS-12 level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the evidence before us, the Commission finds that complainant is not entitled to future pecuniary losses in the sum of $3,000.00. First, we note that future pecuniary losses are out-of pocket expenses that are likely to occur after conciliation or conclusion of this claim. For example, moving expenses, job search expenses, medical expenses, psychiatric expenses, physical therapy expenses, and other quantifiable out-of pocket expenses that are likely to occur as a result of the discriminatory conduct. Therefore, we find that complainants claim for loss of future career opportunities is not a compensatory damage claim but is an equitable relief claim. The Commission has found that "the remedy to which a complainant is entitled included subsequent promotions which the complainant would likely have received had he or she received the position directly in issue at the time of the original selection." <span class="Italic">Rai v. Dept. of Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880596 (August 12, 1988); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. HUD</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940482 (September 21, 1995). However, we find that complainant has not presented any evidence showing that subsequent promotions would have normally occurred during the time since complainant's discriminatory nonselection in September 1995. Moreover, we find complainant's assertions on this issue too speculative to warrant any claim for entitlement to such damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> and <span class="Italic">Winston</span> is that in the former case the complainant sought future pecuniary damages for the loss of earning potential in any position. In <span class="Italic">Winston</span>, the complainant specifically claimed that he would have obtained subsequent promotions at the agency but for the discrimination. The Commission requires that a complainant claiming loss of future earning potential prove his claim with "reasonable certainty or reasonable probability, and there must be evidence which will permit the fact finder to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss." <span class="Italic">Ghazzawi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15327 (2002) (denying a loss of future earnings award based on evidence that other employees received promotions).</p>
<p class="noindent">There also is a distinction between front pay, which is an equitable remedy, and future pecuniary damages intended to compensate a complainant for loss of earning potential. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30005 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We pause to briefly address an error in the AJ's remedial award. The AJ found that the agency's unlawful conduct was the sole and proximate cause for the complainant's becoming permanently restricted to working no more than four hours a day, and that he was therefore entitled to an award of "front pay and future benefits" to compensate him for the difference between the salary and benefits he would have earned had he been able to work an additional four hours a day, and the workers' compensation payments and associated benefits he received, and would continue to receive, for the four hours a day he could not work. While the AJ's finding that the agency's conduct was sufficiently causally related to this financial harm to the complainant is supported by substantial <span id="Page_1823"></span>evidence in the record, the award of "front pay" is not the proper remedy. Front pay is an equitable remedy that compensates an individual when reinstatement would be an appropriate remedy but is not possible. <span class="Italic">Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &#x0026; Co.,</span> 532 U.S. 843, 850 (2001). By contrast, lost earning capacity represents a loss in one's future earning power and is distinct from the issue of front pay. <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980429 (Aug. 12, 1999). That is, an award for the loss of future earning capacity considers the effect that the individual's injury will have on his or her ability in the future to earn a salary comparable with what was earned before the injury.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Accordingly, the AJ's remedial award compensating the complainant for his lost earning capacity from the date of the AJ's decision to his sixty-fifth birthday, offset by the workers' compensation benefits paid to him for that period, is not properly described as an award of front pay, but as an award of future pecuniary damages. And, as the substance of that award is supported by substantial evidence in the record, it will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">When claiming loss of earning capacity as future pecuniary damages the complainant must establish that his or her injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available and also the likely duration of any diminished earning capacity. In <span class="Italic">Fields v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A41857 (2005), the Commission denied a claim for future pecuniary damages based on lost earning capacity explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that the individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to her. <span class="Italic">Carpenter, supra</span>. Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence which demonstrates with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the loss has been sustained.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the record evidence is inadequate to make an award for any claimed impact on complainant's future earning potential. Although complainant was granted disability retirement and claims that she can never return to work because of the discriminatory conduct, the medical evidence of record does not indicate with reasonable certainty or probability that complainant could not have worked in other federal or non-federal jobs at some point before complainant's planned retirement date. In so finding, we note the letter from complainant's social worker, dated April 7, 2003, stating "Throughout our subsequent sessions [complainant] has focused largely on the issues of the workplace and on her increasingly difficult time in coping with the expectations of her job, the continued presence in the workplace of the man who harassed her, and her perception of the lack of protection and support provided her by her superiors and most of her fellow workers. In general, her condition has improved significantly during this time, as she remains depressed and anxious and is even less able to function on the job, currently applying for disability status." These statements from the social worker indicate that complainant had difficulty working in her current job, but do not suggest a narrowing of the range of other economic opportunities available to her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record is also devoid of evidence of the likely duration of complainant's diminished future earning capacity. A letter from complainant's psychiatrist dated March 21, 2003, indicates that complainant could not currently work in the job she previously held, and further states "Whether at some point [complainant] would be able to return to employment in a different federal situation, in a different type of job is impossible to define at the present. Her condition, beyond the work responsibilities, would have an effect on her ability to be in the workplace. She would be absent at times, episodically and not necessarily predictably." In the April 7, 2003 letter from complainant's social worker, he states "It is very clear that the harassment has significantly affected her ability to return to work in her present condition, and has likewise caused her to miss substantial time at work since it occurred." This evidence does not demonstrate that complainant's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to her. Complainant has failed to provide evidence which demonstrates with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the future wage loss has been sustained, and recovery for those losses must be denied.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without much explanation, in <span class="Italic">Otero v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a44064.txt">01A44064</a> (2005), the Commission rejected a final agency decision that awarded $20,000 in future pecuniary damages and then reduced the award by two-thirds. The Commission found that the full $20,000 award was justified based on the testimony of the complainant's psychiatrist that he would need another 18-24 months of therapy and medication and "that complainant had no history of psychological treatment or intervention prior to the detail at issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The decision does not make clear on what basis the agency reduced the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50003.txt">07A50003</a> (2006), the Commission remanded the case for a specific determination of future pecuniary damages not to exceed $210,000 based on loss of future earning capacity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we note that complainant's psychologist stated that complainant could not return to work for the agency due to increased trauma, and stated that during the time he was treating complainant, her symptoms were so significant that she could not work. Therefore, upon review of the record we find complainant has presented medical evidence establishing that she was unable to return to work as a direct result of the unlawful discrimination and suffered a loss in her future earning capacity. As a remedy, we order the agency to calculate complainant's loss of future earning capacity for two (2) years from the date of the agency's final order. In determining complainant's lost earning capacity, the calculations should include complainant's wages, agency contributions to health benefits and life insurance premiums, and agency contributions to Civil Service Retirement or the Federal Employees Retirement System, and the Thrift Savings Plan.<span class="Italic"> Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997). As further guidance, in the present case we note that on remand the agency should begin calculating complainant's loss of future earning capacity using her annual rate of pay in effect at the time she was determined unable to return to work, which was $43,218.00. Any future pecuniary damages paid to complainant must be offset by the amount of any wage replacement benefits she received from the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) and any fringe benefits which have been continued under OWCP. As stated by the AJ, under Title VII, awards for loss of future earning capacity are subject to the statutory cap for compensatory damages--in this case $300,000.00. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D). Since complainant was previously awarded $90,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages, complainant's award for future pecuniary losses cannot exceed $210,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a failure to accommodate led to a deterioration in the complainant's condition, the Commission upheld a future pecuniary damage award that did not set an amount certain but was premised on making up the difference between what the complainant could work and would have been able to work but for the discrimination for a 10-year period. In <span class="Italic">Liang v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090030 (2010), the agency did not appeal the finding of discrimination or the $150,000 nonpecuniary damage award. However, it did dispute the judge's order of relief that the agency provide the complainant with a fulltime position within her medical restrictions and, because the complainant's ability to work fulltime as impaired because of the failure to accommodate, further ordered the agency to pay as future pecuniary damages the difference between what she actually made working and what she would earn if she was able to work fulltime. The judge also ordered the agency to pay for 10 years of medical treatment physical injuries. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Liang</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pecuniary damages may be awarded for losses that are directly or proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages. Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 8 (July 14, 1992). Pecuniary losses are out-of-pocket expense incurred as a result of the agency's unlawful action, including job search expenses, medical expenses, and other quantifiable out-of-pocket expenses that are incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Future pecuniary losses are likely to occur after resolution of the complaint. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Diminished Earning Capacity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The purpose of injunctive relief is to make the complainant whole. In this case that means she must be placed in the position she would have been in if the wrongs had not been committed beginning in May 2005; namely, in a fulltime position which accommodates her physical restrictions. There is no doubt that carrying out this task is complicated by the fact that the complainant's current physical condition is worse than it was in May 2005 because of the agency's discriminatory conduct. As such, she is currently unable to work eight hours per day or to perform tasks she previously was able to perform. Nonetheless, the complainant is in this situation through no fault of her own. Therefore, the agency must provide the complainant with suitable work to accommodate her disability. And, as the agency's conduct caused the complainant's current inability to perform the duties and work the full-time schedule that she was working in May 2005, the agency must compensate the complainant in the future for the difference between what she currently is earning and the wages she would have earned absent the agency's discriminatory conduct (less applicable off-setting workers' compensation payments). As there is no evidence that the complainant would not have been able to continue working in the position she held in May 2005 for the indefinite future, I find that ten years following the implementation of this Decision is a reasonable period in which to hold the agency liable for accommodating the complainant with fulltime work or the monetary equivalent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ Decision at 34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has awarded future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity where a complainant has shown that his or her future earning power has been diminished as a result of the agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050084 (March 6, 2007) (awarding future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity for a period of two years); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30005 (July 16, 2004) (<span id="Page_1824"></span>compensating the complainant for his lost earning capacity from the date of the AJ's decision until his sixty-fifth birthday); <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980429 (August 12, 1999) (awarding 6 years of future pecuniary damages for complainant's loss of future earning capacity, totaling $152,034.00). Proof of entitlement to damages for loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that an individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to her. <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05980429. Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence to demonstrate with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the earning capacity has been impaired and there must be evidence "which will permit the [fact finder] to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency itself "...does not deny that complainant has demonstrated her earning capacity is impaired." Appeal Brief at 7. However, the agency argues that 10 years has not been shown to be a reasonable period of time for the award pertaining to future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity. The agency notes, in part, that complainant will be eligible for retirement before the end of 10 years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concurs with the AJ's determination that complainant is entitled to full-time work within her current medical restrictions for a period of 10 years or pay for all hours she is not provided work for a 10 year period. In so finding, we note that the agency has not shown that 10 years is an unreasonable period of time for the award, nor has the agency provided persuasive evidence that complainant would likely retire when she becomes eligible for retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission wishes to emphasize however, that an agency could have legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating or modifying complainant's employment during that time period (e.g. poor performance or poor conduct on complainant's part). Accordingly, we clarify this remedial order to note that complainant is to be provided with full-time work or diminished earning capacity damages for 10 years, however, she shall be subject to the same standards of performance and conduct as any other similarly-situated employee. In circumstances where her performance or conduct legitimately warrants termination of employment, the agency will not be considered to have breached this Order if it terminates complainant's employment before the close of the 10 year period, and in such case, the agency would not be required to pay her for all hours she is not provided work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Medical Bills</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, as to the Order to pay complainant's medical bills for physical injuries related to the agency's discrimination and harassment, for a period of 10 years, the agency has not shown that 10 years is an unreasonable period of time, and substantial evidence of record suggests that complainant will incur medical bills (related to the agency's discrimination) for at least a 10-year period. We recognize, but cannot assign a great deal of weight to complainant's doctor's claim that complainant has the capacity to improve if she undergoes certain medical procedures. First, it is only speculative that she would improve (and how much), and even if the procedures were certain to improve her condition, it is complainant's prerogative to make her own decisions concerning how (and whether) to seek treatment for her medical problems which were exacerbated by the agency's own actions. Accordingly, we concur with the Order that the agency pay complainant's medical bills for physical injuries related to the agency's discrimination and harassment, for a period of 10 years.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission indicated that the agency and the complainant should be able to come to agreement on a "fair amount" of future pecuniary damages for the medical bill. Although the Commission did not specifically address the issue in <span class="Italic">Liang</span>, presumably, in addition to termination for misconduct or poor performance, the future pecuniary damage award would terminate if the amount, combined with the nonpecuniary award, exceeded $300,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also upheld a future pecuniary damage award for loss of earning capacity in <span class="Italic">Butler v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090010 (2010). The Commission found that the administrative judge did not err in ordering the agency to compute the award based on the assumption that the complainant would have retired when she reached 62.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not sufficient to support a claim of loss of earning capacity to submit evidence that the complainant is unable to work in any functional capacity at his former workplace. In <span class="Italic">Conrad v. Attorney General</span>, 0120090690 (2010), the Commission rejected the complainant's claim for loss of earning capacity damages explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant seeks reimbursement of loss of future earning capacity. Where complainant has shown that his future earning power has been diminished as a result of the agency's discrimination, the commission has awarded future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A3005 (July 16, 2004); <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980429 (August 12, 1999); <span class="Italic">Moore v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050084 (March 6, 2007). Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that an individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to him. Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence to demonstrate with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the earning capacity has been impaired and there must be evidence which will permit the fact finder to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, complainant claims that he was unable to work at any position, not just in his former position. The record supports the finding that work stressors (beginning in 1999) caused a progressive decline in complainant's functional status to the point where he was unable to work in any functional capacity at his former workplace as a supervisory attorney. The agency found that the duration was nineteen months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant presented sufficient evidence to conclude that the retaliatory acts diminished some of his functional capacity, the medical evidence of record does not indicate with reasonable certainty or probability that complainant could not have worked in other federal or non-federal jobs at some point. Moreover, the record is devoid of evidence of the likely duration of complainant's diminished earning capacity. A letter from complainant's psychiatrist indicated that complainant could not return to the job he previously held, but did not predict whether and when complainant could work in other jobs. The evidence does not demonstrate that complainant's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to him, and accordingly, this claim must be denied. We agree with the agency's determination for the reasons herein with regard to the issue of future pecuniary relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Attorney General</span>, 0120102516 (2011), the Commission remanded the case for a determination of future pecuniary damages where a sexual assault on a corrections officer by an inmate resulted in the complainant's inability to work. In noting the award could not exceed $125,000 because of the statutory cap of $300,000 and the fact that it had already awarded $175,000 in nonpecuniary damages. In remanding the case to the agency to determine the loss of future earning capacity, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lemons</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that following the sexual harassment she went on disability retirement because her Post Traumatic Stress Disorder resulted in her inability to work. Complainant asserts that because her inability to work is directly related to the Agency's discriminatory actions, she is entitled to receive compensation for her loss in future earning potential up to the date she would have been eligible to retire on June 11, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award for the loss of future earning potential considers the effect that Complainant's injury will have on her ability in the future to earn a salary comparable with what she earned before the injury. <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980429 (August 12, 1999) <span class="Italic">citing McKnight v. General Motors Corp.,</span> 973 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1992). Where Complainant has shown that her future earning power has been diminished as a result of the Agency's discrimination, the Commission has awarded future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity. <span class="Italic">See Morrison v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (April 18, 2006) <span class="Italic">citing Brinkley, supra; Hernandez v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30005 (July 16, 2004). Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that the individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to her. <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995). Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence which demonstrates with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the loss has been sustained. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> citing Annotation, Evidence of Impaired Earnings Capacity, 18 A.L.R. 3rd 88, 92 (1968). Such evidence need not prove that the injured party will, in the near future, earn less than she did previously, but that "[her] injury has caused a diminution in [her] ability to earn a living." <span class="Italic">Carpenter, supra, citing Gorniak v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.,</span> 389 F.2d 481, 484 (3d Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency points to the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Fields v. Dep't of Defense</span> in which we found that the complainant was not entitled to compensation for loss in future earning potential because the medical evidence of record did not indicate with reasonable certainty or probability that the complainant could not have worked in other federal or nonfederal jobs. EEOC Appeal No. 01A41857 (July 5, 2005). The Agency asserts that Complainant, like the complainant in<span class="Italic"> Fields,</span> only established that she can no longer work at the Agency and did not offer medical evidence to establish that she was unable to work in general.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant's specific circumstances are distinguishable from the complainant's circumstances in <span class="Italic">Fields.</span> Here, Complainant's work experience for the 15 years prior to the sexual harassment and ultimate sexual assault was as a prison guard. Complainant's medical documentation makes it clear that Complainant will no longer be able <span id="Page_1825"></span>to work as a prison guard because of the injuries she suffered as a result of the sexual harassment and sexual assault. We find that Complainant's inability to work as a prison guard narrows the range of economic opportunities available to her with reasonable certainty or probability, particularly since her only remaining job possibilities are outside of her relevant work experience. Therefore, we find that Complainant is entitled to receive compensation for her loss in future earning potential up to the date she would have been eligible for regular retirement on June 11, 2011. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Dep't of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720090010 (May 27, 2010) (Complainant was granted an award for the loss of future earning capacity where evidence established that she would not be able to return to any position at the Agency, and the award was limited to the date when Complainant reached the retirement age of 62).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As guidance in calculating these damages, the Agency should calculate Complainant's loss of future earning capacity by computing the amount Complainant would have earned, plus benefits, if she had remained employed by the Agency from the date she left on worker's compensation leave until June 11, 2011. Any future pecuniary damages paid to Complainant must be offset by the amount of any payments she received from her disability retirement payments, any wage replacement benefits she received from the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP), and any fringe benefits which have been continued under OWCP. Under Title VII, awards for loss of future earning capacity are subject to the statutory cap for compensatory damages--in this case $300,000.00. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D). Since Complainant was awarded $175,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages, Complainant's award for future pecuniary losses can not exceed $125,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">A frequent claim made by a complainant is that, but for the agency's discrimination, he or she would not have retired and would have continued working to a ripe, old age. Such claims are seldom successful because of their speculative nature. For example, in <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a53933.txt">01A53933</a> (2006), the complainant retired after the agency transferred her to a facility in Philadelphia where exposure to diesel fumes would have exacerbated her asthma. The Commission rejected a claim for future pecuniary damages where the complainant, who was 55 at the time of retirement, alleged that she planned to work until her late 60s. The Commission found the claim was simply too speculative.</p>
