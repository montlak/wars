<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-99"><span class="space">l.</span> Separating the Harasser and the Victim: Moving the Harasser</h5>
<p class="noindent">Given the increased focus on sexual harassment cases, it would be wise for agencies to have a standing policy that would require temporary reassignment of the alleged protagonist while investigating complaints of sexual harassment. Such a policy is not required, however, and an agency is <span id="Page_882"></span>not required to reassign every alleged harasser. The agency must review the circumstances to ensure that reassignment is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission is largely unforgiving when it comes to excuses as to why the agency could not separate a sexual harassment perpetrator from the victim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pierson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120063611 (2007), the Commission rejected an argument that the agency should not be liable because reassignment of the perpetrator would have required the approval of the Undersecretary of Defense:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency nevertheless argues that it took corrective action because it removed complainant from S1's supervision and transferred him to a different supervisory position. We find this action, however, to be an insufficient attempt to remedy the situation. The agency reassigned S1 out of complainant's workplace only after she consulted with the EEO Counselor. In the interim, the agency took mere perfunctory measures to address complainant's claim. For his part, S1 continued to have inappropriate physical contact with complainant, and even intimidated her by placing himself in closed, isolated spaces with her. The agency explains that reassigning S1 to another base was not a "viable option" because such a move would require the approval of the Undersecretary of Defense. According to the agency, relocating him to another position within complainant's workplace was a more "reasonable" alternative. Ex. F-6; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Ex. F-9. This excuse is inadequate. The agency is under an obligation to do "whatever is necessary" to end the harassment, make the victim whole, and prevent the misconduct from recurring. Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 (Mar. 19, 1990); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999) (stating that "remedial measures should be designed to stop the harassment, correct its effects on the employee, and ensure that the harassment does not recur"). Taking only some remedial action does not absolve the agency of liability where that action is ineffective. <span class="Italic">See Logsdon v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40120 (Feb. 28, 2006). Accordingly, because the agency has not satisfied the affirmative defense, we find that it is liable for the harassment of complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reassignment of the alleged harasser is not required where the opportunity for contact between the alleged harasser and the purported victim is minimal. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Munson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930571 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is generally true, as stated in the previous decision, that if a transfer is appropriate, the harasser rather than the victim is the one to be transferred. However, the circumstances of this case do not warrant the alleged harasser's transfer as part of an offer of full relief. Initially, the Commission notes that appellant requested a transfer. Secondly, the previous decision mistakenly stated that the alleged harasser was appellant's supervisor. The record reveals and appellant has acknowledged that the alleged harasser was not her supervisor. They were in different branches of the Ordnance Department and typically did not encounter one another. Although appellant argues that the alleged harasser could hinder her opportunity for advancement should she seek a position in his branch, the Commission finds that possibility is speculative and would not warrant reassignment of the alleged harasser, particularly since under the hypothetical situation presented appellant would have sought a position under his supervision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Helen G. v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 0120182282 (2019), initially removed the alleged harasser for grabbing the complainant's breast, but the MSPB reversed the termination in favor of a suspension. After the alleged harasser was reinstated, the agency returned him to the same building as the complainant. The complainant claimed that the alleged harasser's return to work in her work area subjected her to sex discrimination. The Commission disagreed, reasoning that the alleged harasser was returned to work only after he successfully appealing his removal to the MSPB. In <span class="Italic">Helen G</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record and the contentions on appeal, including those not specifically addressed herein, we find that even if we assume that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination, we find the Agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, namely, that the MCW was returned to the Agency after successfully appealing his removal from the Agency to the MSPB. While the Agency acknowledged that Complainant should have been alerted about MCW's return, there was no persuasive evidence that its failure to do so was based on Complainant's sex. In this regard, we note that the Agency, based on Complainant's allegations about the MCW, terminated his employment. Moreover, the Agency explained that the MCW, after his reinstatement, had to be assigned to Building 13 because he had lost his qualifications and he had to be qualified before he could return to regular duties in other locations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant being moved to a different work location, management explained that it moved Complainant to make the situation more comfortable for her. The Agency maintained that it was under no obligation to separate Complainant and the MCW; and it was easier to put him in Building 13 because that was where most employees without qualifications were assigned. Similarly, those with physical/medical restrictions, like Complainant, were also assigned to work in Building 13, however, there were other places that offered limited light duty assignments. S1 also asserted that he was not condescending with Complainant, and simply asked her if she wanted to take leave. He also denied preventing her from speaking with the shop superintendent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that management credibly explained that because the MCW did not have qualifications, he was assigned to water duty. There is no evidence in the record which suggests that management assigned him to this specific work group because of Complainant's sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant did not demonstrate that the Agency's reasons were pretext for discrimination. More importantly, we find that Complainant did not show that the MCW made any inappropriate remarks or took any inappropriate actions upon his return.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant's contentions on appeal, we find that other than her conclusory statements she has not provided any evidence which suggests that discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span> was involved in the matters that took place on July 5 and 6, 2017. Complainant's speculation that she will be harmed by the Agency's actions in the future does not demonstrate that the Agency's explanations were unworthy of credence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that under the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17 (1993) that Complainant's claim of hostile work environment must fail. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Mar. 8, 1994). A finding of a hostile work environment is precluded by our determination that Complainant failed to establish that the actions taken by the Agency, on July 5 and 6, 2017, were motivated by discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>. <span class="Italic">See Oakley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01982923 (Sept. 21, 2000). Therefore, we find that Complainant has not demonstrated that she was subjected to discrimination or harassment with regard to the Agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">While there are some cases holding that the mere presence of the alleged offender can serve to aggrieve the complainant, there is no bright-line rule. In <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01930567 (1993), the Commission found the complainant was not aggrieved by the mere presence of a patient whom she alleged sexually harassed her. The Commission noted the complainant was not assigned to treat the patient and that there were no allegations of further harassment since the initial complaint. However, the Commission also noted that the agency would be required to take prompt and effective remedial action should the harassment recur in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency was not absolved of its obligations where it offered to reassign the victim and the alleged harasser, but both declined in <span class="Italic">Thomasina B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120141298 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record establishes that supervisors were aware that CW2 was harassing Complainant and making offensive remarks about her sexual orientation as early as August 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the supervisors effectively handled the situation because S5 asked Complainant and CW2 if they wanted to move, and they both declined. After a review of the record we find that S5 did not act effectively when he did not separate Complainant and CW2 immediately after he learned of the allegations of harassment. S5 should have moved CW2, the harasser, regardless of her desire to stay in her location. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that S5 conducted an investigation into the claims of harassment in order to determine what would be an appropriate effective action. The record establishes that the harassment continued after S5 was notified. Further, while the record establishes that, after S6 was notified of the harassment, he spoke to the unit in a meeting about inappropriate conduct, there is no indication in the record that he spoke directly to CW2 about her inappropriate and offensive behavior, or that he conducted any investigation into the matter to determine what actions would be appropriate to stop the harassment. There is no evidence that CW2 was ever counseled or disciplined for her offensive behavior. The record establishes that the harassment continued until Complainant and CW2 decided on their own to put aside their differences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the rumors that were rampantly spread across the facility about Complainant's sexual orientation and relationship with CW1, the record establishes that, since July 2010, almost all supervisors and coworkers knew of the rumors. There is no indication that any supervisory official took any action to stop the rumors once it was brought to their attention. In fact, evidence in the record shows that supervisors also engaged in spreading the rumors. As a result, we find that the Agency is liable for the coworker harassment.</p>
