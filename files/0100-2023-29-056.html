<h4 class="h4" id="sec20-57"><span class="space">4.</span> Failure of Board to Consider Allegations</h4>
<p class="noindent">The issue of the Board's responsibility to consider allegations of discrimination and, specifically, what lengths it must go to in order to give such allegations adequate consideration has been a source of tension between the EEOC and the MSPB. The Board's judges, not unlike their EEOC brothers and sisters, like to limit the issues for hearing. Though there may be other reasons, one reason is that fewer issues mean less work. Less time is spent at the hearing because the issues have been limited; less time is spent writing decisions because fewer issues have to be addressed. To aggravate matters further, the Commission does not hold evidentiary hearings when it reviews a Board case. When the Commission feels that further evidence is necessary, the case is remanded to the Board for the taking of additional evidence. This unhappy situation, no doubt, annoys the Board's judges who must absorb the additional work. The tension between the Commission and the Board in this area is understandable even if it does place the parties to a proceeding in the midst of a territorial dispute. As discussed more fully below, the conflict has been resolved by the Board holding that its administrative judges should hold hearings in a case even where the employee has raised a frivolous allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1688"></span>When an appellant properly raises an issue of discrimination before the Board, it does not deprive the EEOC of review jurisdiction when the Board fails to consider the allegations in its final decision. <span class="Italic">Jeffers v. Department of Navy</span>, 03840194 (1986). In cases where the Board failed to issue a decision on the allegations of discrimination, the Commission may decide issues of discrimination based on the record before the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Board is required to consider allegations of discrimination raised in its appeals, as a sanction for failure to obey its orders, it may refuse to consider the discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See Hinton v. Postmaster General</span>, 03930014 (1993). In that case, the complainant failed to respond to agency interrogatories related to his claims of discrimination after twice adequately ordered to do so by the Board. The Commission found the Board was justified in imposing the sanction of failing to consider the allegations, given the complainant's obstinate refusal to provide the ordered responses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The real fireworks between the Board and Commission started over the Board's policy of dismissing allegations of discrimination prior to the hearing if, in the opinion of the administrative judge, the appellant has not produced sufficient evidence to move forward with the claim. In <span class="Italic">Clenney v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03920116 (1992), the Commission found the Board erred as "a matter of EEO law" when it dismissed the appellant's claim of sex discrimination prior to the hearing. In that case, the Board's administrative judge found that the employees to whom the appellant sought to compare herself were not similarly situated because they did not work for the same supervisor and had alcohol instead of drug-related problems. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> remanded the case to the Board for the taking of additional evidence, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission must determine whether the MSPB's decision with respect to appellant's allegations of discrimination constitutes an incorrect interpretation of any applicable law, rule, regulation or policy directive, or is not supported by the evidence in the record as a whole<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1613.416(c). After considering petitioner's contentions and thoroughly reviewing the record, the Commission finds that the record before it is incomplete with regard to petitioner's allegation of disparate treatment based on sex. Therefore, the Commission is referring the case back to the MSPB to obtain evidence related thereto pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.416(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the prehearing conference, the AJ found as a matter of law that the individuals whom petitioner named as comparatives were not similarly situated for purposes of an affirmative defense of disparate treatment based on sex because: 1) the individuals did not work under the proposing official in petitioner's unit, 2) all but one of the individuals had alcohol-related problems, and 3) the one individual whose problems were drug-related resigned after the agency issued him a notice of proposed removal. Consequently, the AJ rejected appellant's allegation of sex discrimination and barred her from presenting any evidence related thereto at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that, as a matter of EEO law, the MSPB AJ erred in rejecting appellant's claim of sex discrimination prior to the hearing. The Commission is charged with reviewing issues of prohibited discrimination raised in conjunction with issues appealable to the MSPB. 29 CFR 1613.401. By rejecting appellant's allegation prior to the hearing, the AJ effectively restricted the development of the record in that regard and thereby precluded the Commission from reviewing the claim as it is required to do under its statutory mandate. Consequently, the Commission refers the matter back to the MSPB pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.416(d) to convene a supplemental hearing before an MSPB AJ. At such time, the AJ shall allow into the record any and all evidence--both testamentary and documentary--relating to petitioner's allegation of disparate treatment based on sex, which petitioner previously had intended to present and which the MSPB AJ improperly excluded during the hearing. After obtaining this additional evidence, the Board should refer the matter to the Commission. The Commission will review the additional evidence and then issue a decision on the merits of both issues, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, petitioner's allegation of handicap discrimination as well as her allegation of disparate treatment based on sex. In that regard, the Commission specifically notes that it is reserving its ruling on petitioner's claim of handicap discrimination until that time.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 416 (1996), the Board tackled the practice of administrative judges dismissing allegations prior to the hearing, as well as the authority of the EEOC to order a case back to the Board for additional evidence. In <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, the Board's administrative judge upheld the removal of the employee and also dismissed his claim of discrimination. The EEOC then remanded the case back to the Board. In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 03950114 (1995), the Commission found that the Board's administrative judge dismissed the allegation of discrimination prior to hearing. Moreover, the Board's judge refused to accept the agency's EEO investigative report into evidence. The Commission remanded the <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> case back to the Board, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that, as a matter of EEO law, it is error for an MSPB AJ to reject a petitioner's discrimination claim prior to the hearing<span class="Italic">. Catherine A. Clenney v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920116 (September 23, 1992). The <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> case involved an allegation of disparate treatment that was rejected by the AJ prior to the hearing. The AJ in <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> ruled that the individuals whom petitioner named as comparatives were not similarly situated for purposes of supporting an affirmative defense of discrimination, and rejected her affirmative defense on those grounds. In our consideration of the MSPB decision in <span class="Italic">Clenney</span>, we found that the AJ's action effectively restricted the development of the record, thus precluding the Commission from reviewing the claim as it is required to do under its statutory mandate. Consequently, we referred the Clenney decision back to the MSPB for a supplemental hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, too, as shown by the above quotations from the record, the AJ rejected petitioner's claim in advance of the hearing and did not provide an opportunity for petitioner to state his affirmative defense based on race. As a result, the record lacks sworn testimony and documentary evidence on the matter. In particular, we note that the AJ did not accept the EEO investigative report nor did he allow development of petitioner's claims of disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has decided to refer this matter back to the MSPB pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.305(d) to convene a supplemental hearing before an MSPB AJ. At such time, the AJ shall allow into the record any and all evidence, both testamentary and documentary, relating to petitioner's allegation of race discrimination, including, but not limited to, all evidence that petitioner had intended to present but was improperly excluded from doing so. After obtaining this additional evidence, the Board should refer the matter to the Commission for its review of the additional evidence and issuance of a decision on the merits of petitioner's allegations of discrimination based on race and retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> did not set well with the Board. The Board rejected the Commission's referral of the case for the taking of additional evidence. Although the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> purports to agree with the position taken by the EEOC with regard to dismissal of discrimination allegations prior to hearing, it took issue with much of what the EEOC had to say on the subject. First, the Board rejected the notion that the Commission had "absolute authority" to remand a case to the Board. The Board further rejected the notion that whether its administrative judges could dismiss an allegation of discrimination prior to the hearing was a matter of EEO law. The Board explained its position in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, 70 MSPR at 420-25:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7702(b)(4), 5 USC, provides that in reviewing a Board decision in a mixed case, the EEOC "may refer the case to the Board, or provide on its own, for the taking (within such period as permits the Commission to make a decision within the 60-day period prescribed under this subsection) of additional evidence to the extent it considers necessary to supplement the record." Thus, the EEOC has the authority and the discretion to refer a case to the Board for the taking of additional evidence under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(b)(4), and the Board generally will accept such a referral without specifically discussing its propriety. <span class="Italic">See generally, e.g., McLaughlin v. Department of the Interior</span>, 16 MSPR 152 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board has not hesitated to disagree with and decline such an EEOC referral, however, when it exceeded the scope of the EEOC's authority. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 120, 121-22 (1988) (in referring case back to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(b)(4), the EEOC "exceeded the scope of its authority"). Because the EEOC's decision in the instant case raises several significant questions pertaining to the scope of the EEOC's authority under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(b)(4), we address those questions here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its referral decision, the EEOC relied on <span class="Italic">Clenney v. Rice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920116, slip op. at 4 (Sept. 23, 1992), to state that "as a matter of EEO law, it is error for an MSPB AJ to reject a petitioner's discrimination claim prior to the hearing." <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">see also Webb v. West</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03950022, slip op. at 4 (Apr. 13, 1995); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Pena</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940132, slip op. at 3 (Mar. 7, 1995). Thus, the EEOC decision suggests that a Board AJ may never strike a discrimination claim before a hearing. We do not interpret the EEOC's decision so broadly, however, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the EEOC's decisions here and in <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> point out that the appellant identified individuals alleged to have been similarly situated but treated more favorably (thereby presenting nonfrivolous factual allegations that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on disparate treatment), and sought to present pertinent supportive evidence at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, slip op. at 2; <span class="Italic">see Clenney</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">see also Jones</span>, slip op. at 2. The decisions further point out that the AJ made a prehearing determination that the identified individuals were not similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, slip op. at 2 (noting the AJ's prehearing statements that "[i]t turned out that the cases [of the alleged comparables] weren't exactly the same" and that "there appeared to be no merit to [the discrimination] contention"); <span class="Italic">Clenney</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">see also Jones</span>, slip op. at 2-3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon reviewing the facts set forth in the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> line of decisions, including its decision in the instant case, we find that those decisions should be interpreted more narrowly than their broad language would <span id="Page_1689"></span>suggest. That is, when interpreted in light of the facts, those decisions do no necessarily stand for the broad proposition that a Board AJ may never strike a discrimination claim before a hearing. Rather, they reflect, more specifically, the EEOC's determination that where an appellant has presented a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination and sought to present pertinent evidence at a hearing, the Board AJ may not, based on his factual determinations, strike the discrimination claim before a hearing. If the EEOC intended to hold broadly that a Board AJ may never strike a discrimination claim before a hearing, the EEOC's discussion of the facts, as described above, would have been superfluous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, EEOC's own procedural regulations provide that a discrimination claim may be dismissed without a hearing in appropriate cases, under summary judgment procedures. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e). Thus, according to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e), "EEO law" does not absolutely preclude the denial of a hearing on a discrimination. Further, district courts may grant summary judgment in mixed-case appeals brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crawford v. Runyon</span>, 37 F.3d 1338, 1341 (8th Cir. 1994). Moreover, the EEOC has issued decisions in which it declined to overturn a Board AJ's denial of a hearing on a discrimination claim, under some circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Saavedra v. Dalton</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940022, slip op. at 2 (Aug. 24, 1994) (the appellant did not pursue his discrimination claim before the Board AJ and did not object to the AJ's implicit prehearing preclusion of the claim); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Frank</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920024, slip op. at 1 (Feb. 12, 1992) (the appellant "specifically stated during the prehearing conference call that he was not raising an allegation of discrimination" and failed to subsequently explain "why he sought to raise the defense while the hearing was in progress").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is possible that, when the EEOC stated that the AJ's prehearing rejection of the discrimination claim was error "as a matter of EEO law," <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">Clenney</span>, slip op. at 4, the EEOC was referring to substantive EEO law. That is, the EEOC might have meant that the AJ's underlying determination that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination was erroneous as a "matter of EEO law." If so, the holding in those EEOC cases would be that the AJ erred "as a matter of EEO law" in finding that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination, and concomitantly erred in denying him a hearing on discrimination claim. For all of the foregoing reasons, we interpret the EEOC's referral decision here as standing for the narrow proposition that, where an appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegations of discrimination, the Board AJ may not strike the discrimination claim before a hearing, based on his factual determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding issues of substantive discrimination law, the Board must defer to the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hurst v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 282 (1994). Regarding purely procedural issues related to mixed cases, however, the Board owes no deference to the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 37 MSPR at 123 (whether a discrimination claim that was not raised until after the Board process is subject to the mixed-case procedures); <span class="Italic">Spears v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 21 MSPR 535 (1984) (whether the EEOC properly interpreted the statutory mixed-case procedures), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 766 F.2d 520 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see also Jackson</span>, slip op. at 1 (the EEOC lacks "jurisdiction to review" the Board's purely "procedural decision" to reject the discrimination claim for failure to timely raise it).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue addressed by the EEOC's referral decision here, albeit implicitly, is whether the appellant raised nonfrivolous allegations that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, so as to entitle him to a Board hearing on his discrimination claim. The issue implicates Board procedure as well as substantive discrimination law and, as such, is not one over which the EEOC necessarily has primacy. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 796 F.2d 1469, 1471 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (the Federal Circuit examined this issue in the course of determining whether the case was a nonmixed case over which it had jurisdiction). We need not determine here whether we owe deference to the EEOC on this issue, however, because the EEOC's position, as we interpret it above, is consistent with Board law, as discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An appellant's right to a hearing in a Board appeal, including his right to present evidence on any discrimination claim, is of cardinal importance, and is not contingent upon his showing that there is a genuine issue of material facts. <span class="Italic">See Frampton v. Department of the Interior</span>, 811 F.2d 1486, 1488 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (an employee's statutory right to a full and fair hearing includes the right to present every available defense); <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (the Board lacks the authority to grant summary judgment, so that an employee's right to a hearing before the Board is not contingent on his showing that there is a genuine dispute regarding material facts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established, however, that an AJ may strike a discrimination claim before a hearing, if the appellant fails to raise nonfrivolous factual allegations that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Hill</span>, 796 F.2d at 1471; <span class="Italic">Ioannou v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 MSPR 426, 432 (1993); <span class="Italic">Crowe v. Small Business Administration</span>, 53 MSPR 631, 634 (1992); <span class="Italic">Marr v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 196, 200 (1991). It is important to recognize that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination varies depending on the circumstances, and an appellant's allegations should be broadly and liberally construed, particularly if the appellant is<span class="Italic"> pro se</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hill</span>, 796 F.2d at 1472 (Newman, J., additional views) ("the line of demarcation denoting the existence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is not [always] bright, but in the area of subtle discrimination more specificity on the court's part would lead inexorably to less protection for victims," quoting <span class="Italic">McCorstin v. United States Steel Corp.</span>, 621 F.2d 749 (5th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, 37 F.3d at 1341 ("Because discrimination cases often depend on inferences rather than on direct evidence, summary judgment should not be granted unless the evidence could not support any reasonable inference for the nonmovant."). Where an appellant raised such nonfrivolous allegations, but the AJ improperly struck the discrimination claim before a hearing, the case must be remanded for a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Hill</span>, 796 F.2d at 1471 &#x0026; n.1; <span class="Italic">Marr</span>, 49 MSPR at 201.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, we agree with the legal proposition set forth in the EEOC's referral decision here, as we construe it. We find, however, that the EEOC misapplied the legal proposition to the facts of this case. Contrary to the EEOC's determination, the AJ did not strike the appellant's discrimination claim before the hearing. The AJ merely informed the appellant's former attorney of his opinion that the individuals identified as comparables were not similarly situated for purposes of the appellant's discrimination claim based on disparate treatment. An AJ is permitted to inform the parties of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their positions on the issues, and he perceives them. <span class="Italic">See Forston v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 154, 160 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Niswonger v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 665, 672 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is nothing in the record indicating that the AJ struck the discrimination claim before the hearing. Rather, the appellant's former attorney voluntarily decided not to pursue the discrimination claim after discussing the matter with the AJ. Nor is there any indication in the record that, when the appellant retained a new attorney shortly before the hearing, the AJ precluded that attorney from pursuing the discrimination claim. In fact, the AJ allowed the appellant to testify at the hearing regarding his discrimination claim, and the agency to cross-examine the appellant regarding such testimony. Moreover, the AJ considered the appellant's discrimination claim in his initial decision, and concluded that the appellant failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the claim. We therefore disagree with the EEOC's determination that the AJ struck the appellant's discrimination claim before the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board did, however, agree that its administrative judge erred in excluding the agency EEO investigative report from the hearing record. However, because the issue of exclusion of the report was not raised previously with the Board, it held that it lacked authority to consider the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the Commission and the Board are now in harmony following the <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> decision is difficult to tell. In <span class="Italic">Harmon v. Postmaster General</span>, 03960125 (1997), the Commission remanded the case back to the Board because the MSPB administrative judge improperly dismissed the appellant's claim of sexual harassment. Significantly, <span class="Italic">Harmon</span> used some of the same broad language the Board said had to be interpreted narrowly:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that, as a matter of EEO law, it is error for an MSPB AJ to reject a petitioner's discrimination claim prior to the hearing. <span class="Italic">Catherine A. Clenney v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920116 (September 23, 1992). In a recent MSPB decision, <span class="Italic">Crawford v. U.S. Postal Service</span> 70 MSPR 416 (1996), the Board interpreted the Commission's decision to "stand for the narrow proposition that, where an appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination, the Board AJ may not strike the discrimination claim before a hearing, based on his factual determinations." <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, at 422. The MSPB has long held that an MSPB AJ may not strike as frivolous a discrimination claim if, at the prehearing conference, the employee is able to state facts which might establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See Crowe v. Small Business Administration</span> 53 MSPR 631, 634 (1992); <span class="Italic">Marr v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 196, 200 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the MSPB AJ rejected petitioner's discrimination claims based on sexual harassment, race, color age and disability prior to the hearing. There is no evidence in the record that petitioner was able to provide specific information regarding sex (female), race, color, age or disability discrimination at the prehearing conference or prior to the hearing. Accordingly, the record supports the MSPB's determination that those claims were frivolous. In comparison, at the prehearing conference, petitioner was able to state facts which might establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment. The MSPB AJ's restriction of such testimony during the prehearing conference and the hearing has effectively restricted the development of the record, thus precluding the Commission from reviewing the claim as it is required to do under its statutory mandate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.305(d), the Commission is referring this case back to the MSPB in order to supplement the record. At such time, the Board shall allow into the record any and all evidence, relating to petitioner's allegation of sexual harassment which petitioner had intended to present, and which the MSPB AJ excluded from the hearing. <span id="Page_1690"></span>The matter shall then be referred to the Commission, at which time the Commission will review the additional evidence and issue a decision on the merits of petitioner's allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Harmon</span> used the word "shall" in describing what the Board was required to do on remand. It appears that the basic dispute between the Board and the Commission still exists. The Commission seems to view its remand authority as absolute and still adheres to the basic admonition of <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> that it is error as a "matter of EEO law" for the Board to dismiss a discrimination claim prior to the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Andrews v. Postmaster General</span>, 03970032 (1997), the Commission found that the MSPB administrative judge committed error when he made a factual determination about a discrimination case without testimony or a sworn statement from a relevant party. The Commission, critical of the Board's narrow interpretation of EEO law, used the same boilerplate language from <span class="Italic">Harmon</span> in <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Andrews</span> then determined that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and sent the case back to the Board for the taking of additional evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that petitioner presented sufficient facts to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination. Specifically, petitioner has shown that one of the officials who was responsible for his removal, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> the CO, was aware of his EEO activity and that his removal closely followed the EEOC hearing on his second complaint. <span class="Italic">See Wrenn v. Gould</span>, 808 F.2d 493, 500 (6th Cir. 1987). Moreover, petitioner provided sufficient facts which might establish that the PO was also aware of petitioner's EEO activity. Specifically, the hearing on petitioner's complaint was conducted at the Main Post Office where the PO worked closely with witnesses who testified during the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB AJ's rejection of petitioner's reprisal claim has effectively restricted the development of the record, thus precluding the Commission from reviewing the claim as it is required to do under its statutory mandate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.305(d), the Commission is referring this case back to the MSPB in order to supplement the record. At such time, the Board shall allow into the record any and all evidence, relating to petitioner's allegation of reprisal discrimination which petitioner had intended to present, and which the MSPB AJ excluded from the hearing. The matter shall then be referred to the Commission, at which time the Commission will review the additional evidence and issue a decision on the merits of petitioner's allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board finally resolved the dispute by holding that any allegation of discrimination, even a frivolous one, vests the Board with jurisdiction over the claim. The Board no longer even requires the employee to allege a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. National Gallery of Art</span>, 79 MSPR 285 (1998). Ironically, the Board judges are deprived of the summary judgment authority vested in EEOC administrative judges, who may dispose of cases on the merits without holding a hearing pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.109(g).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the Board now holds that its judges must resolve even frivolous claims of discrimination, there are times when the Board's method of looking at a case precludes those claims from being fully heard. For example, in <span class="Italic">Neal v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 03A10055 (2001), the complainant alleged that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on race, color and sex, which ultimately culminated in his coerced resignation. On appeal to the Board, the administrative judge determined that evidence of discrimination was relevant only to the extent that it forced the complainant to resign. The judge further held that evidence of discrimination that was too remote in time from the resignation would be excluded. The Board concluded that the complainant's resignation was not coerced. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Neal</span> found that the Board's decision essentially "unmixed" the case and that it now had jurisdiction over the entire case, including the complainant's allegation of constructive discharge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioner filed two EEO complaints, which the agency consolidated. Following an investigation, the agency issued a final decision. The decision characterized the claim as whether the petitioner was discriminated against based on his race (African American), color (black), sex (male) and in reprisal for EEO activity he was allegedly subjected to a hostile work environment that culminated in his allegedly coerced resignation in January 1997. The decision found that there were no discriminatory incidents, that there was no hostile work environment, and that the complainant's resignation was voluntary. The decision contained appeal rights to the MSPB, and the petitioner filed an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an order prior to the initial decision, the MSPB advised the parties that any evidence of discrimination will be considered only as it goes to the ultimate question of coercion. It advised that evidence too remote from the resignation may be excluded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its initial decision, the MSPB characterized the issue as whether the petitioner's resignation was involuntary. It advised that evidence of discrimination and retaliation may only be addressed insofar as it relates to voluntariness and not whether it would establish discrimination or reprisal under the standards used to prove discrimination. After weighing alleged acts of harassment which the petitioner raised, the MSPB concluded that he did not meet his burden of establishing that his resignation was involuntary. Thereafter, the MSPB denied the petitioner's petition to review the initial decision. Neither decision provided appeal rights to the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the MSPB's position, the Commission has held that there is little point in continuing to view the matter as a "mixed case" as defined by 29 CFR 1614.302(a). The case will thus be considered a "non-mixed" matter and processed accordingly<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Schmitt v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01902126 (July 9, 1990); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900883 (October 12, 1990); 29 CFR 1614.302(b). The petitioner's complaint is referred to the agency for further processing as outlined below. This includes the claims of hostile work environment, constructive discharge, and any other claims in the consolidated complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060003 (2007), the Commission found that neither <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> nor collateral estoppel barred its administrative judge from finding in favor of the complainant on a sexual harassment claim where the MSPB had previously dismissed her claim of constructive removal based on lack of jurisdiction. The Commission noted that the sexual harassment claim was raised only as background evidence in the Board appeal and that the Board's administrative judge consistently limited the evidence on that issue as not being relevant to the claim of constructive removal.</p>
