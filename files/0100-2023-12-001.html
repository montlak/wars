<p class="noindent">The entire complaint process under Part 1614 has been described in detail in <a href="0100-2023-10-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a>, and the reader is referred to that section for an overview of EEO complaint procedures. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a detailed explanation of the initiation of the formal complaint process through to acceptance or dismissal of the complaint. Other stages of the complaint process are covered fully in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the transfer of responsibility for federal sector discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1979, the regulatory framework for processing complaints of discrimination has been revised on several occasions. OriGINAlly, the Commission's regulations for complaint processing were set forth at 29 CFR Part 1613. In 1987, Part 1613 was significantly revised. On October 1, 1992, the Commission replaced Part 1613 with 29 CFR Part 1614 and instituted yet more changes. Again, on November 9, 1999, Part 1614 was substantially revised. Less significant revisions also occurred in 2012.</p>
<p class="noindent">The changes to the formal complaint process brought about by the 1999 and 2012 amendments are discussed thoroughly throughout this chapter. The main thrust of the 1999 amendments, as they relate to agency processing of complaints, was avoiding the so-called "fragmentation" of claims--a theme that has been carried forward, particularly in the 2015 revisions to MD-110. Under the previous regulations, fragmentation of claims occurred when portions of complaints raising several claims were dismissed. The former regulations required that the agency continue to process the accepted claims while the complainant immediately appealed the dismissed portions of the complaint to the EEOC Office of Federal Operations, which often reversed those dismissals. The result was that related claims were subject to multiple investigations by the agency, multiple hearings by EEOC administrative judges, and multiple appeals before OFO. Aside from the tremendous waste of resources on all levels, the process risked conflicting results in related cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Several of the 1999 amendments to Part 1614 were designed to eliminate the fragmentation of claims. In implementing the amendments, the Commission noted its concern that agencies were failing to understand the difference between claims of discrimination and allegations within a claim, resulting in unnecessary fragmentation. To cure this problem, the Commission has redefined what constitutes a claim of discrimination and issued guidance to agencies on how to avoid unnecessary fragmentation in determining complaint claims. Specific measures to avoid fragmentation, discussed in more detail later in this chapter under "<a href="0100-2023-12-006.html#sec3-7">Avoiding Fragmentation</a>," also include eliminating the right of immediate appeal of partial dismissals, requiring administrative judges to review partial dismissals and correct any errors prior to the hearing, and clarifying the Commission's position on amendment and consolidation of complaints. The fragmentation of claims is also discussed in Chapter 2 in the section of "<a href="0100-2023-11-103.html#sec2-103">Determining Claims</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The ultimate result has been an evolution of the formal complaint process from 1979 to the present. Many of the Commission's regulatory changes over the years can only be fully understood in the context of what came before. Indeed, many of the regulatory changes have been specifically designed to remedy the problems created under the oriGINAl Part 1613. Other changes were designed to clarify the intended meaning of the provisions of the oriGINAl Part 1614. As a result, even though Part 1613 was replaced many years ago, it continues to have relevance to the Commission's current interpretation of Part 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent">The formal complaint process begins with the filing of a formal written complaint of discrimination. While the former statement seems, at first, to be self-evident, many agencies require that potential complainants file written requests for counseling. More than one complainant has confused a written request for counseling with the filing of a formal complaint of discrimination. A formal complaint of discrimination may be filed with an agency only after a complainant has completed EEO counseling. The discussion of the formal complaint process begins with the requirements for filing a formal complaint.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec3-2"><span class="space">I.</span> REQUIREMENTS OF FORMAL COMPLAINT</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are few requirements for the filing of a formal complaint, though each requirement is critical. Title 29 CFR 1614.106 simply provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;A complaint must be filed with the agency that allegedly discriminated against the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;A complaint must be filed within 15 days of receipt of the notice required by &#x00A7; 1614.105 (d), (e) or (f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;A complaint must contain a signed statement from the person claiming to be aggrieved or that person's attorney. This statement must be sufficiently precise to identify the aggrieved individual and the agency and to describe generally the action(s) or practice(s) that form the basis of the complaint. The complaint must also contain a telephone number and address where the complainant or the representative can be contacted.</p>
<p class="noindent">While the requirements are few, many complainants fail to adhere to them. The reasons are varied. Often, complainants simply fail to follow the instructions given to them by the agency EEO counselor and repeated in the notice of final interview. In other cases, the counselor gives the complainant either no information or incorrect information. Sometimes, the complainant misunderstands the information provided by the counselor. A large part of the problem is that the process is cumbersome, duplicative and overly complex. It is far too easy for both complainants and agencies to become honestly confused about the process and the specific requirements and time frames for each phase. Parts of the process simply defy logic. For example, it is not hard to understand why a complainant, unfamiliar with the process would assume that a formal complaint of discrimination would be filed with the EEOC, as it is in the private sector, rather than with the agency alleged to have engaged in discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most agencies use a form for filing formal complaints. The form generally is provided to complainants along with the notice of final interview. However, complainants are not required to use the form. The regulations only require that the complaint be in writing and be signed by the complainant or his or her attorney; a letter signed by the complainant stating that it is an EEO complaint is sufficient to meet these requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bacon v. Department of Commerce</span>, 01872467 (1987). The plain language of Part 1614 requires that the formal complaint contain a general description of the actions or practices that form the basis of the complaint. It is doubtful, however, that the Commission would significantly depart from the holding in <span class="Italic">Bacon</span> where the complainant is not represented. The proper procedure when an agency receives a complaint that does not sufficiently define the action or actions at issue or the bases of discrimination is to request that the complainant provide additional information. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(7).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Walls v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01940983 (1994), the Commission reaffirmed its position that a complainant is not required to use an agency complaint form. Although the Commission found that no special format for formal complaints is required, the use of such standardized forms does make it easier for an agency to process complaints. The Commission determined that the agency's efforts to make the complainant use a specific form were inappropriate. But, the error was harmless because the agency accepted the allegations for processing, and there was no evidence that the agency was trying to enforce the form requirement in a discriminatory manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Best v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966735 (1997), the Commission found that the complainant's submission satisfied the requirements for a complaint where he resubmitted a letter of complaint written prior to the start of precomplaint counseling:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case indicates that appellant received a notice of right to file a formal complaint on July 1, 1996. This notice informed appellant that he had fifteen days to file a formal complaint. On July 11, 1996, appellant submitted a number of photocopied documents to the agency. Included was a photocopy of a letter signed by the appellant describing the allegedly discriminatory events that occurred on April 28, 1996, naming the parties involved, and specifically stating that it was these actions causing appellant "to file this complaint." We find that this letter fulfills the requirements of EEOC Regulation 1614.106(c). This letter provides the agency with adequate notice of the existence and nature of appellant's complaint, indicates appellant's clear intent to file a formal complaint, and is, therefore, sufficient to constitute a formal complaint. While the agency emphasizes that the materials were previously submitted, the use of a particular form or the submission of a different document than previously used is not a requirement for filing a formal complaint. We further find that appellant's letter was filed on July 11, 1996, ten days after appellant received notice of the right to file a formal complaint on July 1, 1996, and, therefore, is timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency does utilize a complaint form, it must be careful to design the form in such a way that it elicits sufficient specific information to define the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01963272 (1997), the Commission noted that the complaint was in exceptionally general terms because of "the manner in which the agency has formatted the complaint form. By merely providing a series of general categories for the individual to check, the agency is effectively limiting complainants' tendency to set forth the specific allegation(s) discussed with the EEO Counselor." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission found the counselor's report, and not the complaint form, was controlling as to the claims raised in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_138"></span>Likewise, if the agency leads a complainant to believe that a specific form is required in order to file a complaint, it must provide the complainant with such form in a timely manner. In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01972226 (1997), the Commission remanded the complaint to determine when the complainant received a form that she reasonably thought was required:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that appellant received the notice of final interview on August 14, 1996. We note that the subject Notice of Final Interview states that "[i]f you wish to elevate your complaint to the formal state, please complete DD Form 2655 within 15 calendar days after receipt of this notice." On appeal, appellant contends that she was not able to file a formal complaint in a timely manner because the agency failed to provide her with DD Form 2655 in a timely manner. Clearly, the subject notice would lead the recipient to believe that a DD Form 2655 is required in order to file a formal complaint. Although the agency submits written statements from an EEO Counselor and a Chief EEO Counselor with regard to appellant's receipt of the notice of final interview, it has not submitted any evidence with regard to the date of appellant's receipt of DD Form 2655. Based on the foregoing, the record is insufficient for us to determine whether appellant's formal complaint was filed in a timely manner. Therefore, the agency is Ordered, as stated below, to conduct a supplemental investigation concerning the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">While it may seem self-explanatory, one requirement of an EEO complaint is that the complainant must allege a basis of discrimination--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, race, color, sex, national origin, religion, disability, age, genetic information, or reprisal for EEO activity. More than one basis can be alleged, either in conjunction with one another or in the alternative. The agency properly dismisses an EEO complaint where the complainant alleges no basis of discrimination. The defect cannot be cured on appeal by finally alleging a basis at that stage. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lefcheck v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950812 (1996). The Commission elaborated on this holding in <span class="Italic">Haddon v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950688 (1996), where the complaint tried to argue that articulating the basis on appeal was akin to amending the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency's contention that the facts in the present case are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>. The record indicates that appellant failed to cite any purview during counseling or at the time he filed his complaint. A review of the EEO counselor's report indicates that he was advised that he needed to provide a basis of discrimination. On appeal, he indicated that a white male under 40 years of age was hired; however, unlike the complainant in <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, appellant was not adding a basis to an already valid complaint. Appellant is attempting on appeal to cure a defective complaint. We note that the complaint form appellant prepared clearly listed the bases for discrimination including the bases of race and age; therefore, appellant was on notice that these bases were available to him if he chose to identify them in his formal complaint. As previously noted, appellant indicated that the type of discrimination he had suffered was "unknown at this time." Furthermore, we note that even on appeal, appellant never specifically designated a basis of discrimination. Consequently, the previous decision found it necessary to remand the complaint for a supplemental investigation to determine if appellant had in fact stated a claim with regard to race and age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint was proper and it is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc.</span>, 431 F.2d 455 (5th Cir. 1970), is discussed more fully below in the section, "<a href="0100-2023-12-261.html#sec3-247">Amendment and Consolidation of Complaints</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Castillo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956860 (1996), the Commission relied on the <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span> case to hold that the agency erred in dismissing a complaint where the basis of discrimination was not made clear until the appeal. The difference appears to be that in <span class="Italic">Castillo</span> the Commission was convinced the complainant had not understood this requirement until her appeal was filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision observed that the agency's EEO Request for Counseling form, which the appellant signed and returned, contained the agency's definition of "factors." In response to that form's question, "What Factor(s) Are You Alleging (Be Specific; Describe, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, Race-Black, Sex-Female)?" the appellant wrote "harassment." The final agency decision also indicated that the appellant had received the booklet, What You Need to Know About EEO which clearly states the prohibited bases for discrimination. The final agency decision further indicated that the appellant had received a Notice of Right to File Individual Complaint form that specifically informed her that an EEO complaint could be processed only if the complainant alleges that he or she has been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or retaliation for past EEO activity. Finally, the final agency decision indicated that the appellant did not check any of the eight boxes provided on the agency's formal complaint form to indicate the base or bases of the alleged discrimination. The complaint form provided eight possible boxes to check under the heading "Type of Discrimination Alleged." The appellant drew another box and wrote "harassed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal the appellant informs the Commission that she wants to base the alleged discrimination on race and sex because she was the only black woman working under the 204B supervisor. The agency responded that the final agency decision should be affirmed for the reasons stated therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission gives broad application to the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc.</span>, 431 F.2d 455, 465 (5th Cir. 1970)<span class="Italic">. Geraldine Edwards v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910830 (December 19, 1991). Under <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, complainants are given liberal latitude to clarify the bases of discrimination in their charges, and to add bases of discrimination after filing their charges. The <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span> court explained that there are at least three reasons why a complainant may fail to identify a basis of discrimination in a complaint. First, a complainant may not be aware of an employer's motivation. Second, a complainant may not fully comprehend the distinction between bases. Finally, a complainant may be unschooled and unsophisticated in the use of forms. Applying <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, the Commission has held that where a complainant identified the bases of discrimination before an investigation was conducted, the agency improperly refused to process the bases of sex and reprisal<span class="Italic">. Geraldine Edwards v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910830 (December 19, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, it appears that the appellant did not understand the agency's use of several different words ("factor," "basis," "type") to refer to the alleged basis of discrimination. The appellant also may not have been fully aware of the 204B's motivation for the alleged harassment. However, regardless of the reason why the appellant failed to identify a basis for the alleged discrimination, the fact remains that as soon as the appellant understood that she was required to allege a likely basis for the alleged discrimination, she did so.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly reversed the agency's dismissal in <span class="Italic">Beatriz L. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120182045 (2018), where the complainant had a hard time identifying a proper basis for her claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that the Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's complaint for failure to state a claim under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc</span>., 431 F.2d 455, 462 (5th Cir. 1970), EEOC gives complainants liberal latitude to clarify the bases for their discrimination allegations. In <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, the court explained different reasons for a complainant's failure to identify discriminatory motivation during the complaint process. For example, a complainant may misunderstand the concept of discriminatory bases. It is also possible that a complainant may lack the aptitude to complete the forms properly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span> to the present matter, we find that Complainant failed to identify valid bases because she could not distinguish between discriminatory motives and discriminatory acts and was therefore unable to properly identify a proper basis for her claims. On her formal complaint (VA Form 4939), Complainant stated that "harassment" was Agency management's discriminatory motive. On appeal, Complainant and her representative have clarified that her claim is one of harassment based on reprisal, race and color. Accordingly, we find that Complainant has indeed stated an actionable claim. <span class="Italic">See Castillo v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01956860 (Mar. 22, 1996) (wherein that complainant had written "harassment" to describe the basis for her formal complaint but later articulated race and sex as bases for the harassment during her appeal.) Consistently, Complainant alleged harassment throughout the complaint process. Ultimately, she has identified race, color and reprisal as valid bases on her appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is not required to allege discrimination with any legal precision. For example, in <span class="Italic">Townsend v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120072901 (2007), the complainant alleged discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The agency dismissed on the basis that federal employees are not covered under the ADA. The Commission reversed finding that, although the agency was technically correct and federal employees receive protection under the Rehabilitation Act, the complainant had alleged discrimination on a covered basis, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, disability, and that was all that was required. The fact that the complainant is an attorney does not raise the bar on pleading requirements for formal complaint processes. In <span class="Italic">Rolison v. Attorney General</span>, 0120073281 (2007), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant's failure to use the term "hostile work environment" in the formal complaint should result in rejection of the claim. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rolison</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fair reading of the record at this juncture indicates that complainant raised a hostile work environment claim based on age discrimination. Unlike the agency's assertion in its final agency decision, a complainant does not have to use the magic words "hostile work environment" in order to allege a hostile work environment. The agency admits that complainant described a hostile work environment based on age discrimination, but insinuates that because complainant has been an attorney with the US Attorney's Office for 28 years, he should be held to a higher standard and should have used the words "hostile work environment." We are not persuaded by this argument. After reading the complaint, we are satisfied that complainant has sufficiently raised a hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_139"></span>A complainant is not required to allege a discriminatory basis with any particular fervor, even an ambivalent allegation of discrimination is sufficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Christian v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966686 (1998) (an allegation that "discrimination may have been because her religion was 'Rastatatarin' [sic] and her hair appeared to be different from that of other individual's hair" was sufficient to state claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies are large entities and it is not always clear who at an agency has made a particular decision. There is no requirement that a complainant name an alleged discriminating official, particularly if the complainant honestly does not know who made the alleged discriminatory decision. In <span class="Italic">Syngal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953765 (1996), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complaint where the complainant clearly stated on the formal complaint that she did not know who was responsible for the decision to deny her overtime. The fact that the complainant did not respond to an agency request to provide the name of the alleged discriminating official did not justify the subsequent dismissal of the complaint since the agency had all the information it needed to investigate the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other hand, there is such a thing as going overboard in the naming of alleged discriminating officials. In <span class="Italic">Goatcher v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954826 (1996), the complainant provided a list including the Postmaster General and several other top-level officials. The Commission commented that "[i]n future EEO complaints, appellant's identification of these officials in response to the agency's request for specific names of alleged discriminatory officials may result in the Commission's affirmance of the agency dismissal for failure to prosecute. However, we note that, in this instance appellant's list also identifies agency officials who appear to be direct Supervisors, such as a Manager of Distribution Operations and a Supervisor of Distribution Operations. Under such circumstances, appellant's behavior did not constitute a failure to cooperate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In making a determination of whether to dismiss the complaint, the agency is required to not only review the formal complaint, but also any documents submitted with the complaint and the EEO counselor's report. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61098 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">Many agency forms for filing discrimination complaints require the complainant to include his or her requested relief. The EEO regulations do not require that any form of relief be requested. In some cases, the relief requested may have some relevance to defining the claims in the complaint. However, where the complainant identifies a specific date of the alleged discriminatory incident, but requests relief from an earlier date, this is not sufficient to raise a claim with respect to the earlier personnel action. In <span class="Italic">Haack v. Postmaster General</span>, 01920989 (1992), the complainant maintained that a 1989 transfer request denial was discriminatory, but asked for retroactive relief to 1987--the date he oriGINAlly requested the transfer. The Commission found this was insufficient to put the 1987 transfer denial at issue. It was appropriate, however, for the administrative judge to consider evidence about the 1987 refusal in deciding whether the 1989 refusal was discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although there is no regulatory requirement that a complaint include a request for relief, in <span class="Italic">Carlson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01930284 (1993), the Commission held that a complainant was not entitled to compensatory damages as part of an offer of full relief where no such demand had been made prior to the agency's offer. The Commission further indicated that a complainant must submit some evidence of those damages, as well as evidence of a causal connection between the damages alleged and the agency's action. The Commission now has retreated from its holding in <span class="Italic">Carlson</span> and has permitted the issue of compensatory damages to be raised in response to a certified offer of full relief or even in a request for reconsideration. See <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec21-1">Chapter 21</a>. It should be noted, however, that in the cases where the Commission has allowed a late amendment of a complaint to include a claim for compensatory damages, the complainant was not previously on notice that such a claim must be affirmatively raised. In all likelihood, the Commission would follow <span class="Italic">Carlson</span> if the agency had previously put the complainant on notice that the claim must be raised.</p>
<p class="noindent">While the formal complaint frames the claims for investigation by the agency, "a complaint merely is a starting point for an agency's investigation and that [ ] investigation may include the development of other issues that are discovered during the course of the investigation." <span class="Italic">Powers v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01932033 (1993) (resignation a month and a half after the filing of a formal complaint and factual allegations common to both should have put the agency on notice of a constructive discharge allegation).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complaint is accepted, it will proceed to the investigation stage. See <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec4-1">Chapter 4</a>, below. If the complaint is dismissed, the complainant must be notified of the dismissal in writing and the notice must inform the employee that the agency's decision to dismiss the complaint can be appealed to the EEOC Office of Federal Operations. 29 CFR 1614.110. Partial dismissal of complaints is discussed later in this chapter under "<a href="0100-2023-12-009.html#sec3-10">Partial Dismissals</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a substantial difference between the prerequisites for filing a valid complaint and the definition of claims for investigation purposes. The standard for filing of a formal complaint is not as rigid. A valid charge is made where the appellant's allegations, if true, would constitute unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01831078 (1983). The complainant need only allege that some personnel action, or term or condition of employment is based on a discriminatory motive. The agency can require a more specific definition of the charges before proceeding to an actual investigation. However, the burden is on the agency to assist the complainant in clearly defining the claims for investigation. Investigations are discussed in <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec4-1">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
