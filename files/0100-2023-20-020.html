<section>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec11-19"><span class="space">VI.</span> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS</h2>
<p class="noindent">No discussion of the topic of affirmative action would be complete without noting the current political climate. A few years ago, both Congress and former President Clinton indicated their respective intent to review the subject of affirmative action with an eye toward making changes. President Bush has indicated his own opposition to affirmative action. Many others advocate sweeping changes or even an outright end to the entire concept of affirmative action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although nothing has happened on the legislative front, in July 1999, the Commission revised its regulations on affirmative action at 29 CFR Part 1608. This section begins only with the caution that everything that follows is subject to change in the near future.</p>
<p class="noindent">Change in fact seemed imminent when the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Piscataway Tp. Bd. of Education v. Taxman</span>, 117 S. Ct. 2506 (1997). The issue in <span class="Italic">Piscataway</span> was whether a nonremedial affirmative action plan used in teacher layoffs violated Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Piscataway</span>, the Board of Education admittedly used race as one criteria in deciding whom to retain during a reduction-in-force. Many predicted the Supreme Court would use <span class="Italic">Piscataway</span> to strike down all affirmative action. The <span class="Italic">Piscataway</span> case settled, in part, because the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People contributed a large sum to the settlement. No doubt, however, the Supreme Court will continue to look for a case to review its current affirmative action position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Speculation that the Supreme Court might abolish any form of affirmative action was fueled by the decision of the Court in <span class="Italic">Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena</span>, 115 S. Ct. 2097 (1995). The <span class="Italic">Adarand</span> case involved a constitutional challenge to the minority contractor set-aside rules of the Department of Transportation. In <span class="Italic">Adarand</span>, a divided Court held that racial categories, regardless of how they are used by the government, are always subject to strict scrutiny and must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest. However, in separate concurring opinions both Justices Scalia and Thomas indicated a strong belief that the use of race by the government as a criterion is absolutely barred by the U.S. Constitution. In his concurring opinion, Justice Scalia wrote, "In my view, government can never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 239. For his part, Justice Thomas wrote, "As far as the Constitution is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government's racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 240.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2003, the Supreme Court decided two cases with affirmative action repercussions. Both cases involved college admission policies and, although they have no direct bearing on employment cases, they do stake out what is the likely outcome in such cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Grutter v. Bollinger</span>, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), the Supreme Court was confronted with a challenge to a University of Michigan Law School admissions policy that considered racial and ethnic background along with several other "soft variables" in selecting law school candidates. In that case, a divided Court upheld the admissions policy as a narrowly tailored policy to promote a diversified student body. The Court in <span class="Italic">Grutter</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of its goal of "assembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse," the Law School seeks to "enroll a 'critical mass' of minority students." Brief for Respondents Bollinger <span class="Italic">et al.</span> 13. The Law School's interest is not simply "to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin." <span class="Italic">Bakke</span>, 438 U.S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). That would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional<span class="Italic">. Ibid.; Freeman</span> v. <span class="Italic">Pitts,</span> 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992) ("Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake"); <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> v. <span class="Italic">J. A. Croson Co.,</span> 488 U.S., at 507. Rather, the Law School's concept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These benefits are substantial. As the District Court emphasized, the Law School's admissions policy promotes "cross-racial understanding," helps to break down racial stereotypes, and "enables [students] to better understand persons of different races." App. to Pet. for Cert. 246a. These benefits are "important and laudable," because "classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting" when the students have "the greatest possible variety of backgrounds."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 246a, 244a.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Law School's claim of a compelling interest is further bolstered by its <span class="Italic">amici</span>, who point to the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity. In addition to the expert studies and reports entered into evidence at trial, numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and "better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals." Brief for American Educational Research Association <span class="Italic">et al.</span> as <span class="Italic">Amici Curiae</span> 3; <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, W. Bowen &#x0026; D. Bok, The Shape of the River (1998); Diversity Challenged: Evidence on the Impact of Affirmative Action (G. Orfield &#x0026; M. Kurlaender eds. 2001); Compelling Interest: Examining the Evidence on Racial Dynamics in Colleges and Universities (M. Chang, D. Witt, J. Jones, &#x0026; K. Hakuta eds. 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. Brief for 3M <span class="Italic">et al.</span> as <span class="Italic">Amici Curiae</span> 5; Brief for General Motors Corp. as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 3-4. What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military assert that, "[b]ased on [their] decades of experience," a "highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps. . .is essential to the military's ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national security." Brief for Julius W. Becton, Jr. <span class="Italic">et al.</span> as <span class="Italic">Amici Curiae</span> 27. The primary sources for the Nation's officer corps are the service academies and the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), the latter comprising students already admitted to participating colleges and universities<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 5. At present, "the military cannot achieve an officer corps that is <span class="Italic">both</span> highly qualified <span class="Italic">and</span> racially diverse unless the service academies and the ROTC used limited race-conscious recruiting and admissions policies." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> (emphasis in original). To fulfill its mission, the military "must be selective in admissions for training and education for the officer corps, <span class="Italic">and</span> it must train and educate a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps in a racially diverse setting."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 29 (emphasis in original). We agree that "[i]t requires only a small step from this analysis to conclude that our country's other most selective institutions must remain both diverse and selective." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to "sustaining our political and cultural heritage" with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society<span class="Italic">. Plyler</span> v. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982). This Court has long recognized that "education. . .is the very foundation of good citizenship." <span class="Italic">Brown</span> v. <span class="Italic">Board of Education,</span> 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954). For this reason, the diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The United States, as <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span>, affirms that "[e]nsuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American society, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 13. And, "[n]owhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context of higher education." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation's leaders<span class="Italic">. Sweatt</span> v. <span class="Italic">Painter</span>, 339 U.S. 629, 634 (1950) (describing law school as a "proving ground for legal learning and practice"). Individuals with law degrees occupy roughly half the state governorships, more than half the seats in the United States Senate, and more than a third of the seats in the United States House of Representatives.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Brief for Association of American Law Schools as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 5-6. The pattern is even more striking when it comes to highly selective law schools. A handful of these schools accounts for 25 of the 100 United States Senators, 74 United States Courts of Appeals judges, and nearly 200 of the more than 600 United States District Court judges<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have confidence in the open-ness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide this training. As we have recognized, law schools "cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts."<span class="Italic"> See Sweatt</span> v. <span class="Italic">Painter</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 634. Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education necessary to succeed in America.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on "any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue." Brief for Respondent Bollinger <span class="Italic">et al.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students. Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individual's views, so too is one's own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race <span id="Page_794"></span>unfortunately still matters. The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a "critical mass" of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible to further a compelling state interest, government is still "constrained in how it may pursue that end: [T]he means chosen to accomplish the [government's] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose." <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> v. <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> 517 U.S. 899, 908 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to ensure that "the means chosen 'fit'. . .th[e] compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype." <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> v. <span class="Italic">J. A. Croson Co.,</span> 488 U.S., at 493 (plurality opinion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since <span class="Italic">Bakke</span>, we have had no occasion to define the contours of the narrow-tailoring inquiry with respect to race-conscious university admissions programs. That inquiry must be calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the use of race to achieve student body diversity in public higher education. Contrary to JUSTICE KENNEDY's assertions, we do not "abandon[ ] strict scrutiny,"<span class="Italic"> see post</span>, at 8 (dissenting opinion). Rather, as we have already explained, <span class="Italic">ante</span>, at 15, we adhere to <span class="Italic">Adarand</span>'s teaching that the very purpose of strict scrutiny is to take such "relevant differences into account." 515 U.S., at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system--it cannot "insulat[e] each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants." <span class="Italic">Bakke, supra</span>, at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, a university may consider race or ethnicity only as a "'plus' in a particular applicant's file," without "insulat[ing] the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 317. In other words, an admissions program must be "flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Law School's admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in <span class="Italic">Bakke</span>, truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in a flexible, nonmechanical way. It follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, at 315-316. Nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission<span class="Italic">. Ibid</span>. Universities can, however, consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a "plus" factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant<span class="Italic">. Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are satisfied that the Law School's admissions program, like the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell, does not operate as a quota. Properly understood, a "quota" is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are "reserved exclusively for certain minority groups." <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> v. <span class="Italic">J. A. Croson Co., supra</span>, at 496 (plurality opinion). Quotas "'impose a fixed number or percentage which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded,'" <span class="Italic">Sheet Metal Workers</span> v. <span class="Italic">EEOC,</span> 478 U.S. 421, 495 (1986) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and "insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats." <span class="Italic">Bakke, supra</span>, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). In contrast, "a permissible goal. . .require[s] only a good-faith effort. . .to come within a range demarcated by the goal itself," <span class="Italic">Sheet Metal Workers</span> v. <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 495, and permits consideration of race as a "plus" factor in any given case while still ensuring that each candidate "compete[s] with all other qualified applicants," <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> v. <span class="Italic">Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty.,</span> 480 U.S. 616, 638 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Gratz v. Bollinger</span>, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), the Supreme Court struck down an admissions policy at the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science and Arts that awarded 20 of the 100 points required for guaranteed admission to African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans as "underrepresented minorities," who otherwise met the admissions criteria. The Court rejected the argument that racial diversity cannot be a compelling government interest, but found that the admissions policy was not narrowly tailored to advance that interest. The difference in the admissions policy approved in <span class="Italic">Grutter</span> is that in <span class="Italic">Gratz</span> race was a "decisive" factor in admissions.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two aspects of affirmative action. The first involves recruitment of candidates from protected groups which are underrepresented in the employer's work force, and the second involves the actual consideration of otherwise prohibited factors in the selection process to remedy the effects of past discrimination. In the federal sector, Equal Opportunity Recruitment Guidelines are published by the Office of Personnel Management, and guidance with respect to affirmative action in the filling of positions is the province of the EEOC. Consistent with its policy in other areas, the EEOC encourages voluntary affirmative action efforts.</p>
