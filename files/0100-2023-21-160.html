<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-146"><span class="space">B.</span> LINK TO THE WORKPLACE/AGENCY INVOLVEMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">For an agency to be held liable for a coworker or supervisor's social media activity, there must be some link to the workplace. In some instances, the link is easy to establish. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Elenor S. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2019005538 (2020), where the Commission held that an agency can be liable for harassment where a social media group, created by and for agency employees, contained posts that were offensive to females, and the agency management knew of the group. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Elenor S</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding her allegations regarding the Facebook group, "CBP Nation," Complainant attested that she did not know who created the page, but she was aware of the page and had seen some of the posts, which consisted of derogatory language or curse words, sexist, homophobic, and misogynistic materials, including jokes and memes, by male Agency employees without any known repercussions. She alleged that the Agency had a role in creating or approving this page, as it utilized the Agency's name, seal and routinely shows officers in uniform performing their job duties. She also attested that the Facebook group administrators included several named Agency employees. She also alleged some photographs on the page included members of the Agency's management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Chief CBPO (Supervisor4) attested that he created the Facebook group, "CBP Nation," as an additional outreach program for suicide prevention and awareness. He attested that the information shared on the page is work-related, swaps, accolades, achievements, deaths, and port of entry stories. He attested that he was an administrator, along with three other Agency employees, and their function was to monitor any derogatory, inflammatory, and/or offensive posts and delete them, and to block repeat offenders after their initial warning. He attested that the group was for current, former, and retired CBP employees and there were approximately 10,000 to 11,000 members. He attested that the group is not for work-related purposes and is not associated with the Agency. However, he attested that they have, in some instances, reported some posts, comments, or behavior to Agency officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains screenshots of numerous memes and posts, some of which indicate "CBP Nation" on the search bar. Generally, the screenshots display a range of images, including some that are sexist or otherwise objectively offensive to women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's policies on social media usage indicate that the Agency was aware of a private Facebook group page that only a specific group of Agency employees could access, on which inappropriate and offensive posts were made. It advises that the Agency's anti-discrimination policies apply to off-duty conduct that has a nexus to the workplace. It provides that off-duty conduct may have a nexus to the workplace when it: (1) is sufficiently egregious; (2) adversely affects an employee's or co-worker's job performance or management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance; or (3) interferes with or adversely affects the Agency's mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It provides that, if an employee's off-duty conduct, including speech, has a nexus to the workplace and is in violation of the law or Agency policies, that speech is actionable misconduct and, once known to the Agency, the Agency may be held responsible for failing to remedy or prevent further such misconduct. It also provides that the Agency may discipline employees who make objectively offensive statements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency found that the Agency subjected Complainant to discriminatory harassment based on her sex with respect to claim (4), her allegations regarding the CBP Nation Facebook group. As noted above, the record contains numerous screenshots of posts from the Facebook group at issue. Neither party disputes the Agency's finding that this Facebook group involved conduct that was sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would have found it to be hostile or abusive. Nor is it disputed that there was a basis for imputing liability to the Agency. We note for the record that the screenshots of record include posts that are sexually suggestive, sexist, and/or generally offensive to females. We also note that the group was created by and for current and former Agency employees, had 10,000 to 11,000 members, and operated with the knowledge of the Agency. Therefore, we agree with the Agency's finding that the Facebook group's activities resulted in discriminatory harassment of Complainant as a female CBP officer in violation of Title VII. We also find that imputing liability to the Agency was warranted, especially as the group was conducted with knowledge of the Agency's management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To remedy Complainant for the discriminatory harassment, the Agency, in its final decision, provided: (1) Complainant with an opportunity to submit evidence in support of a claim for compensatory damages with the Agency issuing a subsequent final decision to determine an appropriate award; (2) provide Complainant reasonable attorney's fees and costs; (3) provide EEO training to the four identified CBP Nation page administrators focused on sexual harassment and the Agency's social media policy, as well as consider possible disciplinary action; and (4) post a notice of the finding of discrimination to CPB employees in the Hidalgo/Pharr/Anzalduas Port of Entry.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that has a little bit of everything, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Tammy S. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120084008 (2014), found that the complainant, an EEO official at the facility, was subject to a hostile environment based on sex and reprisal and that the agency failed to take prompt and effective corrective action. The complainant, an EEO specialist, voiced concern to the Director of the facility about content on an intranet site, run by a coworker, on the agency's computer network. In particular, the complainant pointed to an article making parody of the Trail of Tears entitled "Trail of Beers," noting that it might be offensive to some. The director instructed that the site be removed from the agency intranet. The coworker did not remove the intranet site, instead using it as a medium to harass the complainant. The complainant filed an EEO compliant that was settled and allowed her to take a sabbatical so that she could get her Master's degree. When she returned to the agency, she was made aware that the coworker had launched a website, external to the agency, that he shared with coworkers and encouraged them to view it. This website contained the same content that was the subject of the complainant's original EEO complaint. The complainant told agency management. The website was blocked from all facility computers and the agency asked the coworker to password-protect the site so that it was not visible to the public.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant filed a second EEO complaint. Before the Commission, the agency argued that it was not responsible for the content on the coworker's private site. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Tammy S</span>. disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has established that she is a member of two protected classes, by virtue of her sex and having engaged in prior protected EEO activity, and that she was subjected to conduct based en her membership in these two classes. Complainant not only engaged in protected EEO activity on her own behalf, but she was the Agency's first full-time EEO Specialist at MSIC. She raised issues with management regarding GW's "Trail of Beers" and the Christmas Social. By doing so, she drew the ire of GW and many employees at MSIC who believed they could no longer wish each other "Merry Christmas," even though this is not what she had advocated. She was labeled the "EEO Gestapo," and GW's "Lord of the Laser" cartoon depicted her as "Ms. E.E.O'Doofus." Complainant testified that the Director told her that that GW "resents the EEO system." GW's cartoon used sexual imagery and language in reference to Complainant, which many co-workers recognized as such, and recognized that Complainant was the individual it was intended to depict. Complainant also argued that GW had published a "parable" which insinuated that her husband was lucky to be losing his vision as he would no longer have to look at her. Additionally, a box of fliers was delivered to her office with the word "Dufus" written in black marker on the box. The totality of this behavior implicates both Complainant's EEO activity and her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_965"></span>Although the Agency disputes that Complainant was depicted in the cartoon, and disputes the sexual nature of the cartoon, we find their arguments to be unpersuasive. A review of the "Lord of the Laser" cartoon, keeping in mind the context in which it was drawn, the relationship among GW, Complainant, and the other employees at MSIC, and the testimony of co-workers about how MSIC employees viewed the cartoon, is supportive of this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Co-worker 1 (CO-1) testified that, "It's obvious who they [the characters] are," in the cartoon and "it's obvious" that it's a "a male penis, okay shooting it like he's shooting, you know, at someone. And I think he said EEO Dufus, Ms. EEO Dufus or something Iike that in the cartoon kind of thing." (OCI transcript, pp. 178-180). Co-worker 2 (CO-2) testified that, "We only had one EEO person at that time and the caricature was such that it was pretty hard not to miss it if you had any inkling of what it was. I mean, everybody that I've seen that's seen the cartoon, immediately that's what they see." (OCI transcript, p. 199). He also stated that, "I heard about it and it became a discussion again around the building a little bit and people talked about it." (OCI transcript, p. 201).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that Complainant found this conduct to be unwelcome. She stated in her Brief that, since her return to the Agency in May 2003, she avoids EEO activities at MSIC, tends to stay in her office, avoids the cafeteria where she would be likely to encounter GW and friends of GW, and she tries to avoid any contact with GW. Although the Agency did not accept the issue for investigation, Complainant also argued in her brief that employees in the workplace are openly hostile to her, which has had the effect of denying her a rotational assignment to another office because the employees in that office did not wish to work with her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the harassment had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with Complainant's work performance and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. The Agency maintains that the re-publication of the "Lord of the Laser" cartoon on GW's public Internet website removes it from a connection to the workplace, and that it therefore cannot have interfered with Complainant's ability to function at work. The Agency also argues that Complainant had voluntarily gone to GW's website and opened the link to the cartoon, thereby exposing herself to the content. However, we find that the hostile environment consisted of more than just Complainant's exposure to the content of GW's website. GW announced his website at an EEO training class in September 2005, thereby reintroducing it into the workplace, after which many employees apparently went back to their desks and pulled up the site to view its content. Many then discussed it in the workplace. There is testimony in the record from CO-2 that, after GW announced his website, he "heard about it up and down the hall." (OCI transcript, pp. 201-202). The Agency further maintains that the actions of GW were not reasonably likely to deter a complainant or others from engaging in protected EEO activity, and that there was no evidence to support the proposition that GW published his cartoon to dissuade Complainant from participating in EEO activities. (Agency's Brief, p. 8). However, CO-1 testified that she had told a co-worker that she had decided against consideration in the IG (Inspector General) office: "And I said I wouldn't be an IG, just like [ ], afraid the same thing would happen to me that's happened to [ ], you know, because she's had a tough time since she was the EEO counselor." (OCI transcript, p. 180).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the hostility to the EEO process shown by GW through the cartoon, the "parable" on his website, and his other writings is sufficient to demonstrate that he engaged in these actions in order to harass Complainant for her role in the EEO program, and for engaging in protected activity. Any other employee who might have been disposed to make similar objections to offensive material, to work to increase diversity and tolerance at MSIC, or to volunteer to be a collateral-duty or full-time EEO Counselor or Specialist would surely think twice before deciding if they themselves would want to be subjected to the same treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We additionally find that Complainant need not show that she was subjected to sexual harassment in order to establish that she was subjected to a pattern of harassment based on her sex and prior EEO activity. The Agency mistakes Complainant's burden here, and is attempting to impose an additional burden on what she is legally required to show by conflating the two types of harassment. Aspects of the unwelcome conduct perpetuated by GW are sexual as well as hostile to the EEO system, which we find sufficient to establish Complainant's claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Liability of the Agency</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the element (5) of a claim of harassment, we now turn to whether there is a basis for imputing liability to the Agency for GW's actions, Complainant argued in her Brief on appeal that GW should be considered a supervisor for the purposes of the Agency's potential liability. She noted that he is a Team Leader, and that the Agency's preparation of his testimony before his investigative interview implied his status as a manager. (Complainant's Brief, p. 1). The Agency argued in its Brief in opposition to Complainant's appeal that GW should be considered a co-worker of Complainant's, as he was never in any position to take any sort of adverse personnel action against Complainant. (Agency's Brief, p. 7). We find that GW should be considered a co-worker for the purposes of analysis of the Agency's liability, as he did not have the authority to take tangible employment actions against Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency is liable for harassment by a co-worker or other non-supervisor when it "knows or should have known of the conduct, unless the agency can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(d). Whether the agency's action is appropriate depends upon "the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps." <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992). The appropriateness of the agency's conduct in response to harassment depends upon "the particular facts of the case--the severity and persistence of the harassment, and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps." <span class="Italic">Owens v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05940824 (Sept. 5, 1996). "Appropriate corrective action" is a response that is reasonably calculated to stop the harassment. When an employer becomes aware of alleged harassment, the employer has the duty to investigate such charges promptly and thoroughly. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953850 (Aug. 29, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was subjected to harassment as perpetuated by a co-worker, GW, and she complained to Agency management about the dissemination of GW's website address in the September 2005 EEO class. Complainant raised the matter with the Director on October 24, 2005. She alleged that the re-introduction of the "Lord of the Laser" cartoon created a hostile work environment, and that the Agency failed to take immediate and appropriate remedial measures. We find that the Agency did not engage in immediate corrective action when it took two months to block GW's website from viewing in the workplace. Although the Agency claimed that it took "prompt" corrective action, it has not supplied a date, or any documentation in the record, which shows when it actually took action to block the website. Complainant asserted that it took the Agency two months to block employees from being able to view GW's website from Agency computers; there is no evidence of record to the contrary. In the absence of any justification for the Agency's delay, we find that taking two months to block GW's website on MSIC computers is not prompt, corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Alfonzo H. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120160450 (2016), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, 0520160327 (2016), the Commission held that discriminatory comments against the complainant and posted on an Internet blog frequented by agency employees were not "sufficiently related to Complainant's employment." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Alfonzo H</span>., held that there was no evidence of agency involvement in the blog or the comments posted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 7, 2015, Complainant filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected him to discrimination on the bases of race (Japanese-American/Asian) and sexual orientation when, on April 1, 2015, he learned that disparaging comments were posted about him on an internet blog frequented by AFSA members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of the alleged discriminatory incident, Complainant was running for an AFSA office and several AFSA members alerted him about the disparaging comments at issue. A multi-paragraph blog post identified Complainant by name in reference to his candidacy for AFSA office. The post, which was critical of Complainant, made reference to his Japanese-American, heritage and sexual orientation, providing details of Complainant's personal romantic relationship. The author is identified only as "Steve," which Complainant alleges is a common pseudonym for individuals who want to post anonymously to that site. Complainant alleges that he believes the post was actually written by the individual employed with the Agency, who was the former AFSA Vice President before Complainant replaced him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains a copy of the blog in question. An examination of the contents of the blog, entitled "Dead Men Working," shows that it does not identify its author and is posted on the non-Agency related internet site Blogspot.com. The blog, which is critical of Complainant, contains the following disclaimer: "The statements on this blog reflect the knowledge and experience of the writers. They do not reflect any official position by the U.S. Department of State."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the facts as presented in this case, we concur with the Agency that Complainant has failed to allege facts that would establish that he is an aggrieved employee. There is simply no indication that the blog at issue was sufficiently related to Complainant's employment. While directed at an audience of current and former Foreign Service officers, there is no indication that blog is sponsored by or affiliated with the Agency or even the AFSA,2 or that Agency resources or official time were used to author the article on the blog. Moreover, while Complainant asserts that an Agency official was the author of the blog article in question, the blog itself does not identify an author other than to indicated the article was posted by "Steve."3 In sum, we conclude that, without more, Complainant <span id="Page_966"></span>has failed to allege sufficient facts to connect the alleged discrimination to his employment with the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Princess B. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120171776 (2019), the Commission also considered the agency's role related to an allegation of harassment where a member of the complainant's union posted a photo of a "large silver penis object" on the union's Facebook page. The Commission not only noted that agency management was not involved in the post, it also discussed the agency's affirmative steps to remove the photo in <span class="Italic">Princess B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the Agency and find that the conduct with respect to the "silver bullet" allegation was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms, conditions and/or privileges of Complainant's work environment. While the Facebook photo and the object itself were not appropriate for the workplace and even offensive to some, these incidents, isolated and fleeting in duration, were not so egregious as to constitute a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, 524 U.S. at 788 (simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment). Moreover, there is no evidence that management played any role in placing the object in the SHU or posting the photo on Facebook, and the evidence indicates that as soon as CAPT and W1, respectively, found out about the photo and the object, they acted quickly and reasonably to ensure their removal. For this reason, Complainant has not demonstrated that management officials knew or should have known about the "silver bullet" events but failed to take adequate steps to address them. <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. at 759.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Matilda C. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120172217 (2017), the complainant's allegation that a coworker took a picture of her and posted it on social media failed to state a claim. The complainant reported the coworker's conduct to her supervisor who directed the coworker to take the photo down. In rendering its decision, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Matilda C</span>. noted that the agency was not involved in the post:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a review of the record, we find that in the instant case, viewing the allegations together and assuming they occurred as alleged, Complainant fails to state a viable claim of a discriminatory hostile work environment. Here, there is no allegation that the Agency took an adverse action against her or had authorized the employee to take a photo of Complainant. Moreover, the Commission has affirmed the dismissal of a complaint alleging that disparaging comments were posted on an internet blog where there was no indication that the blog was sponsored by, or affiliated with, the agency. <span class="Italic">See Alfonzo H. v. Dep't of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120160450 (April 22, 2016), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520160327 (July 20, 2016). In this case, the actions alleged, without more, are simply insufficiently severe or pervasive to state a valid claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that Complainant's complaint was properly dismissed pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Tammi C. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120181557 (2019) (noting that a supervisor's comment on Facebook that "you cannot take a monkey to the circus" was not referring to complainant and there was "no indication that these comments were associated with the workplace").</p>
