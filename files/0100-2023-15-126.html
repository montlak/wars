<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-124"><span class="space">4.</span> Sanctions Against Complainants</h4>
<p class="noindent">In reviewing a decision where the MSPB refused to consider the employee's allegations of discrimination as a sanction for failing to comply with a discovery order, the Commission discussed the factors to consider in deciding whether to impose sanctions and, if imposed, the appropriate sanctions. Although <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Postmaster General</span>, 03930014 (1993), did not involve the Commission's own regulations, it is still instructive as to how the EEOC approaches the issue of sanctions against a complainant for failure to comply with a discovery order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Moody v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03830044 (August 13, 1984), the Commission reviewed sanctions against affirmative defenses of employment discrimination imposed by the MSPB in a mixed case. In so doing, the Commission looked to cases construing Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which contains a similar sanction for striking a pleading. In <span class="Italic">Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers</span>, 357 U.S. 197, at 208 and 212 (1958), the Supreme Court held that the failure to respond to an order to produce is a noncompliance, and brings Rule 37 into play, even though the failure could not have been avoided in good faith, but that the sanction of dismissal cannot be imposed if the failure was due to inability to comply, rather than willfulness, bad faith, or any fault of the defaulting party. It indicated that reasons, such as good faith or willfulness, are relevant only to the path a court might follow in dealing with a failure to comply. Hence, willfulness, bad faith or fault plays a role, along with various other factors, in the choice of sanctions, if any.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have outlined a number of factors which impact on the choice of sanctions. They have looked to see if there were repeated orders to comply with discovery, whether there was confusion by the defaulting party, especially if he is <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>, on his obligation to comply, if the court informed the defaulting party that his reason for noncompliance is invalid and the default may result in sanctions, the degree of noncompliance, and prejudice caused by the default to the opposing party's ability to prosecute or defend a claim. Also, where an alternative and less drastic sanction would be just as effective, it should be utilized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying these principles to the instant case, we find that the MSPB properly struck petitioner's affirmative defenses of employment discrimination. The MSPB's sanction regulation was put into play when petitioner failed to comply with orders by the MSPB to answer the agency's interrogatories. The MSPB's choice of sanction, while drastic, was justified. The MSPB ordered petitioner on two separate occasions to answer the agency's interrogatories. After the first order, petitioner explained to the MSPB that he could not answer the interrogatories until the agency produced documents which he requested. In its next order, the MSPB advised petitioner that this was not a valid excuse. It advised petitioner, as it had before, that he failed to attempt to secure the agency's voluntary cooperation in releasing requested documents before coming to the MSPB with a motion to compel. Any confusion that petitioner had about his obligation to comply with the MSPB's order would have been dispelled by the MSPB's explicit finding that his excuse for noncompliance was insufficient. Rather then comply with the order, petitioner requested the agency to provide documentation, and expanded his document request at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that a federal district court was not persuaded by a similar argument and imposed sanctions. In that case, the plaintiff explained that he failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests because of his mistaken belief that he was not obligated to do so until the defendant replied to the plaintiff's interrogatories. The court found that this excuse did not justify the plaintiff's failure to comply with the defendant's discovery request. Citing this and other factors, the court, as sanctions, dismissed the plaintiffs' case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB warned petitioner in its second order that his continuing failure to comply might result in sanctions which could preclude his affirmative defenses. Petitioner chose to ignore this warning at his own peril. All litigants, even those who are not represented by an attorney, have an obligation to comply with court orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the degree of petitioner's noncompliance was substantial given the repeated orders by the MSPB and his failure to reply to any of the interrogatories. Petitioner could have made an effort to reply to the interrogatories to the best of his ability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency's defense against petitioner's discrimination claims was prejudiced by his failure to respond to the agency's interrogatories. The agency was unable to confirm what evidence, if any, petitioner had to support his affirmative defenses of employment discrimination. There is some question, however, about the extent of this prejudice since petitioner repeatedly tipped his hand by stating his strategies for proving discrimination and asking for specified information which he probably lacked. Even if a lessor sanction was justified because of this factor, such as prohibiting petitioner from submitting evidence which the agency sought, petitioner would still not prevail, as observed by the MSPB, because he did not prove his affirmative defenses of employment discrimination. The record contains no comparative evidence and does not establish, assuming petitioner is making this claim, that the agency had a duty to accommodate his disability by retaining petitioner. We note that the MSPB never precluded petitioner from submitting evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case involving egregious sexual harassment, the complainant's refusal to cooperate during discovery led to the administrative judge imposing a sanction that the complainant could not introduce any documentary evidence of damages beyond that contained in the report of investigation. The judge awarded $5,000 in damages and the Commission increased that award to $20,000 on appeal. <span class="Italic">Strafford v. Attorney General</span>, 0520130322 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld the dismissal of a complaint for discovery-related contumacious conduct in <span class="Italic">Alfred S. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120140900 (2017), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that Complainant has engaged in contumacious conduct. Complainant, who is an attorney, purposefully failed to respond to the Agency's discovery requests for more than a year, significantly delaying the hearing process. Moreover, Complainant had been sanctioned with the dismissal of his hearing request by the same AJ for the same conduct before. Additionally, it cannot be said that the Agency was not prejudiced by Complainant's conduct, as the Agency was forced to cancel its scheduled depositions multiple times. Most significantly, as justification for his failure to respond to the Agency's Request for Production, Complainant admitted to destroying relevant evidence by deleting emails. Not only does this explanation not justify Complainant's failure to respond to the Agency's discovery requests, this explanation demonstrates a blatant disregard for the EEO process and amounts to contumacious conduct. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion by the AJ in dismissing the complaint based on Complainant's contumacious conduct. However, the Commission will critically assess sanctions that have a dispositive effect on a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Charley L. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120091988 (2017), involving a class complaint, the administrative judge excluded evidence proffered by the class from consideration in deciding the agency's dispositive motions. The excluded evidence was 15 affidavits from putative class members and the Class Expert report. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Charley L</span>., found the sanction unduly harsh because the exclusion of that evidence led the administrative judge to decertify the class:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a <span id="Page_509"></span>sanction is, in fact, warranted, would necessarily include the extent and nature of the noncompliance, to include the justification presented by the non-complying party; the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; and, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, a review of the AJ's February 3, 2009 decision indicates that the sanction imposed by the AJ played a dispositive role in his decision to decertify the class. The AJ justified the sanction by concluding that the excluded evidence (15 affidavits and the report of the Class Expert) submitted for the first time by the Class Agent in his opposition to the Agency's motion to decertify the class and motion for summary judgment should have been produced earlier in response to the Agency's document production requests. The AJ concluded that the Class Agent's failure to do so was prejudicial to the Agency. By rejecting consideration of the excluded evidence, the AJ went on to determine that, following discovery, the evidence of record did not support a finding that the class still satisfied the numerosity, typicality and commonality requirements to maintain the class claim notwithstanding the prior certification decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the arguments of the parties and the record as a whole, we conclude that the AJ erred in imposing an overly harsh sanction in this case. In reaching this conclusion, we find particularly significant that the excluded affidavits and expert report were submitted in opposition to the Agency's motion for summary judgment. The record indicates that on July 22, 2008, the Class Agent did not have either the expert's report or the 15 affidavits from class members. The Agency filed its motion for summary judgment on August 18, 2008. A review of each of the 15 affidavits shows that they were obtained between August 18 and September 3, 2008. The expert report was also not provided to the Class Agent by the retained expert until this same period. The process for opposing summary judgment anticipates the actions followed here by the Class Agent. As the non-moving party, the Class Agent was entitled to submit affidavits not drafted during discovery in order to oppose the Agency's representation in its motion that there was no dispute as to any material fact and it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon receipt of the Class Agent's opposition to its motion for summary judgment, the Agency complained it was unfairly prejudiced because the 15 affidavits and the expert report had not been provided to it prior to the July 22, 2008 discovery cutoff date set by the AJ. However, we find that the Agency has not established that it suffered sufficient prejudice to justify the sanction imposed by the AJ. Any delay by the Class Agent was clearly mitigated by the fact that the Agency, unlike the Class Agent, always had complete access to all relevant personnel and merit promotion information and knew the identities of all the individuals who met the class definition and, as their employer, had their personnel files. Moreover, all the data upon which the Class Expert based her report came from the Agency's own databases. A more tailored approach to this situation, if the AJ believed it necessary, would have been to reopen a limited discovery period to allow the Agency to better explore the evidence at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the expert report, we also note that although the AJ carefully managed the discovery period, including its extensions, no specific motion was made or order entered creating a specific deadline for the identification of experts, deposition of experts or exchange of expert reports. The Agency knew the identity of the Class Expert at least as early as January 2008, <span class="Italic">See</span>, footnote 3 of this decision. The AJ relied, in imposing the sanction, on his very general cutoff date for discovery. However, the Class Agent argues that the ability of his expert to produce her report was dependent on the Agency's production of the relevant data. The Class Agent asserts that much of the delay in producing the report is the result of the Agency's production of flawed or unusable data. The record shows that class counsel made numerous attempts, in motion after motion, to request the Agency produce purported missing data or data in a usable/readable format, The record shows that the Class Expert's report was served on the Agency on the same day it was received by the Class Agent's counsel. Again, had the AJ chosen to reopen the discovery period at this time, the Agency could have deposed the Class Expert.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the AJ abused his discretion here by imposing a sanction which, in essence, resulted in the dismissal of the class complaint. As already noted, a less harsh, more tailored option would have been to reopen discovery to allow the Agency the opportunity to depose the Class Experts and explore the other evidence submitted. We also find that the exclusion of the evidence subject to the sanction was critical to the AJ's decertification of the class. While the Agency has also has presented a lengthy argument about why the class should be decertified for lack of commonality and typicality, we find that these arguments have already been fully considered and rejected by this Commission in our decision to certify the class in the first place. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40074, request for reconsideration denied, EEOC Request No. 05A50938. Accordingly, after setting aside the AJ's sanction, we find sufficient cause to vacate his decision decertifying the class. The class complaint remains certified and will be remanded for continued adjudication on its merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">Blatant failure to comply with discovery led to dismissal of three of the plaintiff's claims in <span class="Italic">Schoffstall v. Henderson</span>, 223 F.3d 818 (8th Cir. 2000). The court in <span class="Italic">Schoffstall</span> found that the plaintiff waived the psychotherapist privilege by placing her medical condition at issue in the case. Her attempts to circumvent the court's decision on the waiver issue led the court in <span class="Italic">Schoffstall</span>, 223 F.3d at 824, to dismiss her claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court's June 6, 1999 order directed Schoffstall to execute the SLC and AMHS releases. This directive followed months of stalling and haggling by Schoffstall over the extent of the information to be discovered. She finally executed the releases during the district court's June 22, 1999 discovery conference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The USPS forwarded the releases to the SLC and to AMHS, ending the matter or so it thought. Within weeks, rather than receiving the information authorized by Schoffstall's written release, the USPS received letters from the attorneys for both the SLC and AMHS. The SLC's letter stated that "[p]ursuant to instructions from the litigant, we hereby claim on the litigant's behalf that any records of Ms. Schoffstall in the possession of Spirit of Life Church are privileged from disclosure by virtue of religious privilege." (J.A. at 634.) AMHS's letter similarly refused to provide the requested information because Schoffstall "modified and restricted the scope of the Authorization forwarded by [USPS counsel's] office." (J.A. at 635.) To make matters worse, Schoffstall attempted to conceal her role. In her letter to AMHS, Schoffstall stated that "[t]his letter and the previous letter to Val Wangler (June 1999) are not to be included with [the released information]." (J.A. at 637.) We suspect that Schoffstall intended AMHS to provide only the limited amount of information authorized in her letter, without reference to the letter or to the existence of additional information, requested by the USPS but not provided. Her plan was revealed when AMHS's counsel attached Schoffstall's letter to that he sent to the USPS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receiving these refusals, USPS's counsel demanded that Schoffstall withdraw her instructions to the SLC and AMHS. He threatened to move for dismissal of her case for willful failure to comply with the discovery order if she failed to do so within five days. Again she did not comply. Schoffstall's stalling and her deceitful tactics show a blatant disregard for the district court's order and sufficiently demonstrate that her actions were willful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, her actions prejudiced the USPS. The final pretrial conference was scheduled for September 8, 1999, with trial set for October 6, 1999. The discovery disputes that led to the USPS's motion to compel required the district court to extend the discovery deadline to July 20, 1999. The extension limited the time both parties had to prepare for trial, but rather than being able to focus on completing discovery and beginning trial preparations, Schoffstall's actions required the USPS to spend its time hounding her for releases the court had already ordered her to provide. In fact, she delayed so long that when the USPS ultimately moved for sanctions, it was July 28, 1999, eight days after the discovery deadline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Schoffstall willfully and prejudicially violated the district court's discovery order, we affirm the dismissal of her first, sixth, and eighth claims.</p>
