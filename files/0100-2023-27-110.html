<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-108"><span class="space">5.</span> Initiating a Security Clearance Review</h4>
<p class="noindent">The act of initiating a security clearance review is also reviewable by the Commission for evidence of discriminatory animus. In <span class="Italic">Chatlin v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05900188 (1990), the complainant alleged that the agency had undertaken a review of his security clearance in retaliation for filing previous EEO complaints. The agency in <span class="Italic">Chatlin</span> argued that review of the allegation was precluded by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that [the] allegation...constitutes an attack on the agency's purported misuse of the security clearance process, the Commission is not proscribed, by its policy guidance or by the judicial cases, from determining whether it establishes a case of retaliatory or discriminatory treatment. Due to the fact that the Letter of Intent issued by [the agency] in January 1989, was based in part on the [agency] findings that appellant: (1) had been arrested for assaulting a minor child, (2) was diagnosed as suffering from recurring depression with moderate anxiety, (3) had verbally and physically threatened his coworkers, and (4) had allegedly displayed a gun in his neighborhood in a threatening manner, the Commission finds that it is not in a position to second guess the agency by deciding that these reasons were insufficient grounds for that agency to issue its Letter of Intent in January of 1989. Unlike the Letter of Intent, the Commission finds the agency's decision in August of 1987 to initiate a review of appellant's security clearance status, was not the result of any substantive decision making process, and is thus reviewable by the Commission. In this regard, we note that [this] allegation...challenges the agency's decision to subject appellant to the review process rather than the security clearance requirements themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, the Commission did not rule on the merits of the allegation but remanded the case for further factual development.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01973547 (1998), the Commission found that an allegation that the complainant's access to classified information continued to be suspended because of retaliatory remarks by his supervisor stated a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant challenges the allegedly untruthful and inaccurate statements made by his supervisors that were subsequently used by the agency to continue suspension of appellant's security clearance. Appellant alleged that those statements were made in reprisal for appellant having filed previous EEO complaints against these individuals. Appellant has correctly stated that he suffered harm with respect to the terms, conditions or privileges of his employment. Consequently, he has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720060050 (2010), the Commission found that the agency had initiated a security clearance review of the complainant because of her religion. In that case, the complainant, who was the only Jewish employee at the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School at Fort Jackson, claimed religious discrimination when she was informed that her clearance was suspended, she was detailed from her Training Program Specialist position to the Chaplain's Office, and she subsequently received a performance appraisal that rated her as only "fair." The complainant alleged that the detail was demeaning because she was assigned to answer phones, greet visitors, take out the trash and supervise the cleaning crew. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Alexander</span>, rejected the agency's argument that complaint was barred as being outside the Commission's purview in accordance with <span class="Italic">Egan</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has consistently affirmed the dismissal of claims alleging discrimination upon the revocation or denial of a security clearance, finding that such claims fail to state a claim pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), and are outside the purview of the Commission's jurisdiction. Policy Guidance on the Use of National Security Exception Contained in &#x00A7; 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (EEOC National Security Guidance), EEOC Notice No. N-915-041 (May 1, 1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 520 (1988)); <span class="Italic">Rezaee v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A60451 (April 25, 2006) (citing EEOC National Security Guidance); <span class="Italic">Carr v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A44011 (November 4, 2004) (citing EEOC National Security Guidance). However, the Commission retains authority to review whether the grant, denial, or revocation of a security clearance was carried out in a discriminatory manner. EEOC National Security Guidance; <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092413 (October 16, 2009) (Commission has the authority to review whether agency's request for medical information and documentation was discriminatory); <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060035 (July 28, 2009); <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Department of Defense (Defense Mapping Agency)</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930248 (April 14, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dodson v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01954101 (June 13, 1997), the Commission found discrimination where a manager sought to have an employee's clearance revoked in retaliation for filing EEO complaints. The Commission did not address whether the agency actually decided to revoke the clearance, nor did it analyze the substance of any information that was part of the decision to grant or revoke the clearance. The decision addressed the manager's motivation for seeking to have the employee's clearance removed. Further, in <span class="Italic">Chatlin v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900188 (June 1, 1990), the Commission found that an agency's decision to initiate a review of a security clearance was not the result of any substantive decision making process and was thus reviewable by the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Commission's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Dodson</span> and <span class="Italic">Chatlin</span> applies to the facts in the instant case. Substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that S1 acted differently with respect to two employees, both of whom S1 supervised, and both of whom held security clearances deemed necessary for their respective positions. The record supports the AJ's finding that S1 was aware that both employees engaged in behavior that S1 knew was of the type that could result in suspension of the security clearances they held. Specifically, we note the record shows that E1 had been counseled on at least two occasions for attempting to access without authorization, an agency database with to which access was clearly restricted. S1 did not initiate the process of suspending E1's clearance and nothing in the record indicates it was ever suspended. We find SI did not provide an adequate explanation for his failure to report a review of E1's security clearance. Similarly, when S1 first learned that complainant had suicidal thoughts, S1 did not initiate the suspension of complainant's clearance. We find that S1 has not provided a reasonable explanation for failing to act on the information he first received from the EAP Coordinator, which he claims to have verified by speaking with complainant herself. Substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's finding that when S1 learned later that complainant had accused the agency of creating a hostile work environment because she was Jewish, S1 contacted the appropriate agency officials to commence investigation of complainant's clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the agency's reliance on the analysis in <span class="Italic">Platt v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, EEOC Request Nos. 05A20363 and 05A20365 (January 8, 2003), is misplaced. Nothing in the record shows that S1 had the actual authority to suspend E1's or complainant's clearance and the AJ's decision does not assume that he did. Neither is complainant arguing that the agency should not have ultimately suspended her security clearance and the Commission makes no finding regarding whether the agency should have suspended complainant's clearance. However, the evidence shows that it was with S1's information and input that S3 ultimately suspended complainant's clearance and with that, her access to the ATRRS database. Without access to ATRRS, complainant was in need of temporary duties that did not require a clearance. We note, as did the AJ, that E1's alleged security breach prompted from agency management nothing more than counseling and from S1, not even that. We find the identified behaviors of E1 and complainant appear to be the type of conduct requiring S1 to contact the agency's security officials. We find that S1 has not provided an adequate explanation for failing to act upon notice of E1's conduct, as he did when informed about the substance of complainant's visit to the EAP Coordinator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to claim (b), we find that the evidence shows that once the agency removed complainant's access to ATRRS, the agency reassigned complainant to temporary job duties in the Installation Chaplain's office that the agency knew did not require a security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the record does not establish that the detail to which the agency assigned complainant resulted in any change of pay, promotional potential or had any other adverse impact upon complainant's career for the time that she fulfilled the temporary duties. While complainant argued that she found the job duties degrading or demeaning, we find <span id="Page_1609"></span>the evidence does not show that other employees, not in complainant's protected religious group, whose security clearances were under review (or reinvestigation) fared any better than she did. We find the evidence is not persuasive that discrimination motivated the agency's decision to assign complainant to the Installation Chaplain's office during the time she lacked access to ATRRS, which access complainant clearly needed to perform her regular job duties. We do not find substantial evidence to support a finding of discrimination for claim (b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to claim (c), we find substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that complainant was subjected to discrimination based on her religion when she received an adverse performance appraisal on May 14, 2004. On her May 14, 2004 special appraisal S1 rated complainant as "fair" and noted that complainant "[a]ccomplished objectives at the lowest possible standards." In S1's affidavit of February 9, 2005, S1 states that for the special performance appraisal period, complainant's performance was successful or excellent with respect to all of her objectives, but that she had only achieved 25% of her annual objectives in the 117 days to which the appraisal applied. We find this explanation conflicts with S1's explanation at the time of the hearing and with the agency's arguments on appeal that complainant's performance had deteriorated. During the hearing, S1 stated complainant "was not performing at her best"; however, he did not identify specific instances of performance deficiencies that complainant suffered and failed to adequately explain why he did not counsel complainant concerning performance deficiencies. While S1 does note some personality conflicts between complainant and some of her co-workers, he does not identify actual deficiencies in her work performance. S1 alternately attributes complainant's rating to the length of time to which the appraisal pertained; however, he also notes that complainant could not have accomplished all of her stated objectives at the time of the special rating since some of the objectives were "based on the sequence of training" and some of the training had not yet occurred as of the date of the rating. Upon a review of the record, we find the AJ properly determined that discrimination motivated S1's decision to issue the rating to complainant that he did.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission specifically noted that it was not making any finding on whether the complainant's clearance should have been revoked.</p>
<p class="noindent">But an allegation that the agency acted to suspend the complainant's security clearance before receiving a required medical report is a matter outside of the Commission's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Galbreath v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05980927 (1999). The Commission distinguished <span class="Italic">Galbreath</span> in <span class="Italic">Willa B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120162798 (2018). In <span class="Italic">Willa B</span>., the complainant alleged reprisal for complaining of a hostile work environment when the agency forwarded a criminal report of investigation involving her, which initiated a review her security clearance and a request to submit to a mental evaluation. Specifically, the complainant alleged that the agency's action sought to "shut her [complaining of harassment] down." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Willa B.</span> found that the agency's decisions to forward the criminal report of investigation, initiating a review of her security clearance and requesting a medical examination went to process, not substance, and were reviewable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission does not have jurisdiction to review an agency's determination on the substance of a security clearance decision. Policy Guidance, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Section 703(g) of Title VII is an affirmative defense to a charge of discrimination. However, the Commission is not precluded from determining whether the grant, denial or revocation of security clearances is conducted in a nondiscriminatory manner. Policy Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case turns on distinguishing the substance of making a determination to continue a security clearance from the process of making that determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's decision to initiate a review of a complainant's security clearance is not the result of any substantive decision making process, and hence is reviewable. <span class="Italic">Chatlin v. Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900188 (Jun. 1, 1990). Likewise, if a complainant alleged that the agency required female applicants to take a polygraph examination to obtain a security clearance, but did not require such an examination of male applicants, the Commission could review that aspect of the agency's process. <span class="Italic">Kingan v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996328 (Feb. 15, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that <span class="Italic">Galbreath</span> is distinguishable from the case before us. In <span class="Italic">Galbreath</span>, after the complainant complained to agency officials that people were following her home, gaining access to her apartment, and planting listening devices and watching her home and this was not confirmed by an investigation, management notified the security function in the agency that determines whether individuals are eligible to hold security clearances. The security function requested a physical examination of the complainant. After receiving the medical information, the security function revoked the complainant's security clearance. In <span class="Italic">Galbreath</span>, the Complainant alleged that the revocation of her security clearance was discriminatory, not the Agency's decision to conduct a medical examination. The Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Appellant maintained that she was discriminated against because the revocation of her security clearance was made prior to the agency receiving a medical report. Although this contention appears to be disputed by the record, we find that her concerns fall squarely within the rubric of the type of security clearance determination that is beyond the Commission's jurisdiction. Since appellant appears to be challenging the method by which the agency arrived at its decision, the dismissal of...[the allegation that she was discriminated against when she was notified of the intent to revoke her security clearance] was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Galbreath</span>, the information the agency relied on or did not rely on in deciding to revoke the clearance--medical information--was squarely within the rubric of the substance of a security clearance determination, which is outside the Commission's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant alleges that she was discriminated against when the criminal report of investigation involving her was forwarded to the Office of Security and Suitability, and when that Office initiated a review of her continued eligibility for a security clearance and asked her to undergo a medical examination. She contends that because of her sex and in reprisal for complaining that she has sexually harassed and intimidated over the years by uniformed guards, the Agency sought to shut her down and stop her from continuing to complain by asking her to undergo a psychological examination. She cites an article by a professor, published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Gender, that in employment discrimination litigation "nuts and sluts" refers to the defense tactic of portraying women who bring harassment and employment discrimination claims as too unstable to be believed or too promiscuous to be harassed by forcing them to undergo psychological examinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The acts of forwarding information, initiating a review, and requesting a medical examination go to process, not substance, and is reviewable by the Commission. <span class="Italic">Chatlin</span> and <span class="Italic">Kingan</span>. This is different, for example, from alleging that the results of a request for a medical examination, after they become part of the security file, were discriminatory, i.e., either the examination report or recording that the subject refused to undergo the examination. This is because once statements (or other information) gathered during the investigation are included in the security clearance investigative report, the statements are squarely within the rubric of a security clearance determination and, accordingly, beyond the Commission's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Branigan v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973495 (Jan 9, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In opposition to the appeal, the Agency seeks to distinguish Chatlin and other Commission cases holding that the decision to initiate a review of a complainant's security clearance is not the result of any substantive decision making process, and hence is reviewable. The Agency argues that the Commission cases on initiation regard decisions made by officials outside agencies security divisions responsible for making determinations on clearances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree that this is a ground for distinguishing these cases. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092413 (Oct. 16, 2009) (the complainant was placed on administrative leave after people at work allegedly heard him say he was going to quit his job, commit suicide, and get an Uzi and take everyone out. On his own initiative, the complainant underwent a fitness for duty examination by a board certified forensic psychologist, who cleared him for work. Management informed the arm of the agency responsible for permitting security clearances that Complainant was undergoing a medical evaluation. Meanwhile, management allowed him to return to work. On behalf of this security arm, the agency asked the complainant for a copy of the medical examination, and he was advised that failure to comply could result in the revocation of his security clearance. He was also allegedly required to meet with security personnel and discuss his medical history and condition. The complainant alleged that he was discriminated against based on disability when the agency initiated a review of his security clearance, and for this review demanded medical information and documentation. The Agency dismissed the complaint, finding that the Commission is precluded from reviewing the substance of a security clearance determination. The Commission reversed. It agreed that the Commission will not review the substance of a security clearance decision. Regarding the medical matter, the Commission found that it had the "authority to review the agency's request for medical information...for the security clearance process.... The medical information...was very private, and demanding it states a claim.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the Agency, on behalf of its arm responsible for permitting security clearances, requested medical information from the complainant--this request was not initiated by officials outside the agency's security division responsible for making determinations on clearances. Also, the Agency's attempt to distinguish the case before us from other Commission cases because they regarded decisions made by officials outside agencies security divisions responsible for making determinations on clearances is unpersuasive. While both the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Professional Responsibility (which forwarded the criminal report of investigation) and Office Personnel <span id="Page_1610"></span>Security and Suitability are part of the same Bureau, only the later office is responsible for making decisions on security clearances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's dismissal of issues 2 and 3 is reversed.</p>
