<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-89"><span class="space">b.</span> Hearing Dismissal Reversed</h5>
<p class="noindent">Hearing dismissal is generally reserved for instances involving contumacious conduct. Simple negligence is not enough. And, the sanction must be narrowly tailored to address the complainant's failure.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission acknowledged its more recent decisions reiterating that hearing dismissal as a sanction is justified only in the most egregious of cases in <span class="Italic">Jane S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021000960 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the dismissal of Complainant's hearing request was the appropriate sanction; however, we have consistently held in our more recent decisions that the dismissal of a hearing request as a sanction is only appropriate in extreme circumstances. One such circumstance is when the complainant engages in contumacious conduct, not merely negligence. <span class="Italic">See Wilma B. v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2020003672 (Dec. 2, 2021); <span class="Italic">Cassey B. v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019004838 (Sept. 24, 2020), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 2021000172 (June 9, 2021); <span class="Italic">Cecile T. v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002373 (Sept. 22, 2020); <span class="Italic">Carolyn M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019004843 (Mar. 10, 2020). Examples of contumacious conduct warranting dismissal of hearing requests include: <span class="Italic">Charlie K. v. Dep't of Veteran Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002293 (Sept. 22, 2020) (failure to provide investigative affidavit during agency investigation and failure to provide answers to interrogatories during discovery despite being granted multiple extensions in both phases of the proceedings, as well as failure to appear at pre-hearing conference); and <span class="Italic">Cleo S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120181406 (Feb. 28, 2020) (failure to participate in email communications being sought by the agency and to produce documentation ordered by AJ in a manner demonstrating disregard for the administrative process and unwillingness to comply with AJ's orders despite warning of consequences).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These recent cases demonstrate that there must be a showing that a complainant either willfully disobeyed the AJ's orders or unjustifiably failed to respond to those orders to justify dismissal of the hearing request as a sanction. When a lesser sanction would normally suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his discretion by dismissing the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Georgianne B. v. Dept. of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120181591 &#x0026; 0120181592 (Feb. 27, 2020) (dismissal of hearing request rejected on appeal where AJ dismissed hearing request outright rather than grant agency's motion to compel discovery or limiting complainant's discovery when complainant failed to appear at the initial conference and failed to respond to a discovery request despite the fact that the parties and the AJ remained in continuous email correspondence in an effort to litigate the case); <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120182728 (Feb. 27, 2020) (dismissal of hearing request rejected on appeal where complainant made earnest but unsuccessful effort to comply with an onerous acknowledgement and scheduling order), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 2020002964 (December 29, 2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jane S</span>., the complainant's discovery responses were a few days late when the AJ granted the agency's motion to compel. More than a month later, the agency filed a motion to dismiss, noting that it had been more than five months since the requests were made. The complainant responded to the agency's discovery requests and the motion to dismiss was denied, but the AJ found that the complainant's responses were deficient and ordered her to fully respond. The complainant did not respond within the time allotted. The agency again filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. Despite repeated requests and the AJ's order to produce fulsome discovery, the Commission reversed the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Jane S</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With the foregoing considerations in mind, we find no indication that Complainant engaged in the kind of willful or obstinate refusal to comply with the AJ's orders that typifies contumacious conduct. On the contrary, there appears to be a genuine dispute between the parties as to whether Complainant sufficiently complied with the Agency's discovery requests. Moreover, we note the more than four-year passage of time between Complainant's May 24, 2016, submission, and the AJ's September 30, 2020, dismissal of her hearing request. During this period, we believe the AJ could not only have allowed Complainant further opportunity to cure any deficiencies by providing specific guidance, or crafted a less severe sanction that was specifically tailored to address a situation where an employee's responses to an agency's discovery requests are not "full and sufficient."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of a showing of either willfully disobedience or an unjustifiable failure to respond, we cannot find that the integrity of the process has been so compromised as to warrant the severe sanction of a hearing request dismissal. As such, we conclude that the circumstances in this case do not justify the particular sanction imposed by the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hale v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03341 (2000), the Commission held that the administrative judge abused his discretion in dismissing a complaint where the complainant had not complied with his instructions to submit a request for a continuance in writing. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hale</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the complainant failed to return a Designation of Representative form. The record shows that the complainant contacted the hearings office by phone and informed that office that she was searching for an attorney and requested more time for discovery. She was informed that failure to obtain representation was not grounds for delay, and that extension requests must be made in writing. The complaint was subsequently dismissed. Dismissal as a sanction under these circumstances was unduly harsh and constituted an abuse of discretion by the AJ. There is no evidence that either the hearing process or the responding agency would have been unduly prejudiced by the complainant's failure to submit the form. The complainant's actions in this case may evidence neglect, but not contumacious conduct. Indeed, complainants may proceed to an administrative hearing before an AJ without the benefit of legal representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case was remanded for hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Peters v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02847 (2000), the Commission found the sanction of dismissal for failure to prosecute was an abuse of discretion where the underlying conduct was not contumacious. In <span class="Italic">Peters</span>, the complainant failed to appear for a prehearing conference or explain her absence. The Commission also found the administrative judge erred in not considering whether lesser sanctions would have been effective in deterring subsequent misconduct by the complainant. The complainant's failure to provide complete discovery responses, to respond to the agency's motions to compel, to respond to the judge's order to compel, and to respond to the agency's motion for dismissal was "simple negligence," according to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Frederick A. v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 0120140377 (2016), and did not warrant dismissal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Zilinskas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A11855 (2001), the Commission demonstrated its reluctance to impose dismissal of a complaint as a sanction. In <span class="Italic">Zilinskas</span>, the complainant failed to respond to the judge's order to submit a witness list and then twice failed to respond to notices to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. The Commission held that the failures did not rise to the level of contumacious conduct and the judge erred in dismissing the complaint. The proper sanction in <span class="Italic">Zilinskas</span>, according to the Commission, was to cancel the hearing and remand the case to the agency for a final decision on the existing record. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Carmona v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A03574 (2002) (dismissal was too harsh a sanction for failure to attend prehearing conference); <span class="Italic">Almeida v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985365 (2001) (cancelation of a hearing and remand to the agency as a sanction for final decision on the record was proper where the complainant failed to appear for prehearing conference); <span class="Italic">Hope v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05990282 (2001) (failure of the complainant and counsel to appear at the prehearing conference was properly interpreted as waiver of hearing request and remand for final agency decision was proper); <span class="Italic">Milligan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A11947 (2001) (failure to respond to a scheduling order did not warrant dismissal and cancelation of hearing; remand to agency for a decision on the record was proper).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a rather sympathetic opinion, the Commission reversed dismissal of <span id="Page_622"></span>a hearing where the complainant cited to especially difficult personal circumstances to explain his failure to respond to judge's orders in <span class="Italic">Paul F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2019005369 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he AJ issued an Order to Show Cause that Complainant timely and adequately respond as to why Complainant failed to comply with the February 5, 2019 Order on Status Conference, Deadlines, and Record Completion, which directed the parties to submit their Pre-Hearing statements no later than May 22, 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 14, 2019, Complainant, through his representative, submitted the following response to the AJ s Order to Show Cause:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant is a single father of two teenage children. In February 2019, Complainant s mother fell terribly ill; therefore, Complainant became his mother's primary caretaker. At that time, Complainant became responsible with getting his mother to doctor appointments, ensuring she was taking the proper medications at all times, and being available for his two children to help with homework and ensure they were attended to as his court order custody arrangements stated. This situation made it difficult for Complainant to successfully schedule anything concerning work outside of work time after work. I, Complainant s representative, did try on many occasions to schedule official time in order for Complainant and I to consult but it was difficult as our schedules conflicted due to Complainant s situation. Also, I had prior arrangements as well that made it difficult to meet with Complainant whenever he was able due to my hectic schedule at the time. Also, due to a new bid shift beginning, summer travel and staffing shortages, it was difficult for me to receive official time because I had to oversee the operation. Then on May 5, 2019 Complainant s mother passed away and he became extremely busy with preparations for the funeral and settling her estate in the aftermath of everything as well as console his family and children. This was an extremely difficult time in Complainant s life and still is being that he is still in the grieving process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 25, 2019, the AJ ordered the dismissal of Complainant's hearing request:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant asserts that he had been busy caring for his children, serving as the primary caretaker for his mother, and then grieving his mother s death. Complainant further asserts that the foregoing activities and the busy schedule of his representative prevented him from meeting with his representative. The foregoing explanation does not constitute good cause for Complainant s failure to timely submit a pre-hearing statement. Health issues, family issues and other personal issues do not inherently constitute good cause for failing to meet a filing deadline, even when such issues are serious in nature. Rather, to establish good cause for missing a filing deadline, one must show that he was both physically unable to meet the filing deadline and physically unable to request an extension of time in advance of the filing deadline. Here, Complainant has not shown that he has satisfied either of the foregoing requirements for establishing good cause. Moreover, an inability to communicate with one s representative does not constitute good cause for failing to meet a filing deadline. Accordingly, Complainant has not established good cause for his failure to timely submit a pre-hearing statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ remanded the matter to the Agency for a final agency decision. The Agency subsequently issued a final decision finding that Complainant was not subjected to discrimination as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors pertinent to tailoring a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is even warranted, include: (1) the extent and nature of the non-compliance, including the justification presented by the non-complying party; (2) the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; (3) the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; (4) the number of times the party has engaged in such conduct; and (5) the effect on the integrity of the EEO process as a whole. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the first factor, we find that Complainant's non-compliance consisted of his failure to submit his pre-hearing statement by May 22, 2019, in accordance with the AJ s Order dated February 5, 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the second and third factors, we find that the prejudicial effects as well as the consequences in terms of delayed justice resulting from Complainant s noncompliance were minimal in that the situation could have been quickly remedied by the imposition of a new deadline to submit a pre-hearing statement. In applying the fourth factor, we find that there were no other incidents of non-compliance with the AJ s Orders that could be attributed to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have consistently held in recent decisions that dismissal of a hearing request as a sanction is only appropriate in extreme circumstances. One such circumstance is when the complainant engages in contumacious conduct, not merely negligence. <span class="Italic">Cassey B. v. Dep t of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019004838 (Sept. 24, 2020); <span class="Italic">Cecile T. v. Dep t of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002373 (Sept. 22, 2020); <span class="Italic">Carolyn M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 2019004843 (March 10, 2020). Examples of contumacious conduct warranting dismissal of hearing requests include: <span class="Italic">Charlie K. v. Dep t of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002293 (Sept. 22, 2020) (failure to provide investigative affidavit during agency investigation and failure to provide answers to interrogatories during discovery despite being granted multiple extensions in both phases of the proceeding, as well as failure to appear at pre-hearing conference); and <span class="Italic">Cleo S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120181406 (Feb. 28, 2020) (failure to participate in email communications being sought by the Agency and to produce documentation ordered by AJ in a manner demonstrating disregard for administrative process and unwillingness to comply with AJ s orders despite warning of consequences). Absent a showing of contumacious conduct, hearing requests may be dismissed where the complainant fails to pursue his or her claim with due diligence. <span class="Italic">Alice S. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019002475 (Sept. 22, 2020) (failure to respond to emails from AJ that included initial conference order and order to show cause due to overlooking those emails); <span class="Italic">Robert A. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120182698 (Feb. 21, 2020) (failure to respond to order to show cause despite having received order from AJ via email, and failure to provide evidence that he was incapacitated and unable to comply with the order). In other words, there must be a showing that Complainant either willfully disobeyed the AJ s orders or unreasonably failed to respond to those orders in order to justify dismissal of the hearing request as a sanction. In the absence of either circumstance, we cannot as a matter of law find that the integrity of the administrative EEO complaints process had been so compromised as to warrant the most severe sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In dismissing Complainant s hearing request, the AJ stated that serious health issues do not inherently constitute good cause for failing to meet a filing deadline unless Complainant demonstrates that he is physically unable to either meet that deadline or request an extension of time in advance. However, in two recently issued decisions in which the complainant raised illness as a defense to non-compliance, the Commission still required a showing of either contumacious conduct or failure to exercise due diligence on the part of the complainant in order to justify imposing the harshest sanction available. <span class="Italic">See Cher C. v. Dep t of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002081 (Sept. 21, 2020) (complainant s assertion that she was ill during early phase of discovery undercut by her failure to provide an affidavit to the investigator after multiple requests, willful and repeated failure to participate in the hearing process, filing false pleadings, withholding evidence, and failing to request extensions of discovery based on her alleged illness). <span class="Italic">See also Kristie O. v. Dep t of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002756 (Sept. 23, 2020) (complainant s assertion that her representative was ill and unable to respond to the AJ s order undercut by her failure to offer any proof that either she or her representative attempted to inform the AJ of their inability to timely comply with the order).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a lesser sanction would have normally sufficed to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, we have held that the AJ had abused his or her discretion by dismissing the hearing request in the absence of a clear showing of contumacious conduct or failure to exercise due diligence on the part of the complainant. <span class="Italic">See Georgianne B. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos 0120181591 &#x0026; 0120181592 (Feb. 27, 2020) (dismissal of hearing request rejected on appeal where AJ dismissed hearing request outright rather than grant Agency's motion to compel discovery or limiting the complainant's discovery when the complainant failed to appear at the initial conference and failed to respond to a discovery request despite the fact that the parties and the AJ remaining in continuous email correspondence in an effort to litigate the case); <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120182728 (Feb. 27, 2020) (dismissal of hearing request rejected on appeal where the complainant made earnest but unsuccessful effort to comply with an onerous acknowledgement and scheduling order).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant did not claim that he himself or his representative was ill. Rather, he asserted that he had been overwhelmed by his mother s sudden decline in health and her passing on May 5, 2019, two weeks and three days prior to the deadline for filing his pre-hearing statement. Emotional traumas can be every bit as incapacitating as physical ones, especially when the passing of a loved one is involved. We can find no evidence that Complainant had engaged in or exhibited the kind of willful or obstinate refusal to comply with an AJ s orders that typifies contumacious conduct. Such behavior was clearly present in <span class="Italic">Charlie K</span>., <span class="Italic">Cleo S.</span> and <span class="Italic">Cher C</span>., but absent in <span class="Italic">Georgianne B</span>. and <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y.</span> Likewise, we do not find that Complainant willfully failed to act with due diligence as was the situation in <span class="Italic">Alice S</span>., <span class="Italic">Robert A</span>. and <span class="Italic">Kristie O</span>. Rather, the worst that could be said about Complainant is that he was negligent in overlooking the May 22nd deadline for submitting his pre-hearing statement. This is entirely understandable given that his mother had passed away recently before. We therefore find that the AJ s dismissal of Complainant s hearing <span id="Page_623"></span>request was too harsh a sanction. Any one of the lesser sanctions listed in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) of section109(f)(3) would be appropriate to address Complainant s noncompliance with the AJ s prehearing conference scheduling order dated February 5, 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission pointed in <span class="Italic">Paul F</span>., evidence of a complainant's prior involvement in the litigation process may be considered when determining a proper sanction. In <span class="Italic">Georgianne B. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120181591 (2020), the complainant failed to comply with a show cause order for missing an initial conference and the AJ dismissed the complaint. Reversing the dismissal and noting that the sanction must be narrowly tailored to the failure, the Commission also considered the complainant's prior engagement in the process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the sanction imposed by the AJ was too harsh and a lesser sanction would serve the purpose of deterring similar conduct in the future. The AJ should have tailored the sanction to what was lost by the missed Initial Conference, rather than a dismissal of both requests for hearing in their entirety. The record indicates Agency Case No. FS-2017-00238 was a new case before this AJ and the Initial Conference was the first scheduled meeting on this matter. The previous AJ handling the case as of December 19, 2017, was the Supervisory AJ in the Los Angeles District Office. The record reveals that sometime between December 19 and December 27, 2017 the two cases were reassigned to the current AJ. There is no evidence in the record the parties were informed of the reassignment. The first communication from the new AJ was on December 27, 2017, when the new AJ issued the "Notice of Receipt of Hearing Request, Order Directing Agency to Produce Investigative File, Order to Forward Notice to Agency Representative, and Order Scheduling Initial Conference" on both complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that Complainant's representative and Agency counsel had continuous email correspondence, to which the previous AJ was copied. The record shows Complainant and her representative were actively engaged in the litigation of both EEOC Hearing Nos. 480-2017-00629X and 480-2017-00052X and in constant communications with Agency counsel, despite the discovery issues. Thus, in the present case we find a more reasonable approach should have been taken regarding the sanctions imposed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As Agency counsel's emails detail, the Agency specifically wanted to address a pending Motion to Compel filed by the Agency against Complainant on one of the complaints during the scheduled Initial Conference. Rather than granting the Motion to Compel or limiting Complainant's discovery as a sanction, the AJ imposed the harsher sanction of dismissing the complaints from the hearing process in their entirety. The Commission finds a lesser sanction would have sufficed to prevent Complainant or her representative from failing to adhere to the AJ's orders in the future. Because of our determination in this case, we decline to address the Agency's findings on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120182728 (2020) (complainant's prior engagement in the process and the fact that the AJ's orders were confusing led the Commission to reverse a dismissal).</p>
<p class="noindent">The commission in <span class="Italic">Po v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10836 (2001), seemed to draw a distinction between failing to respond to a request from an agency versus a request from the AJ. Only the latter may support hearing dismissal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Administrative judges may dismiss complaints pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.107, on their own initiative, after notice to the parties, or upon an agency's motion to dismiss a complaint. 29 CFR 1614.109(b). In this case, the AJ dismissed the complaint pursuant to 1614.107(a)(7) which states, in pertinent part, that where the agency has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information, and the complainant has failed to respond to that request within fifteen days of its receipt, the agency may dismiss the complaint, provided that the request included a notice of proposed dismissal (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(7) is only available to an AJ as a sanction when the complainant fails to comply with an agency request for relevant information<span class="Italic">. Hale v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). Here, complainant failed to comply with an AJ's request for relevant information. In such cases, administrative judges should avail themselves of the sanction provisions contained within 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3); EEOC Management Directive 110, Chapter 7, pp. 9-10(1999). Such sanctions may include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> But these sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. Dismissal of a complaint by an AJ as a sanction is only appropriate in extreme circumstances, where the complainant has engaged in contumacious conduct, not simple negligence<span class="Italic">. See Thomas v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01870232 (March 4, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Broughton v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01A14837 (2002) (dismissal by administrative judge was inappropriate under 1614.107(a)(7) and may only be imposed as a sanction under 1614.109(f)(3)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05420 (2002), the Commission did not find contumacious conduct where the complainant gave conflicting explanations of his failure to be available for a prehearing conference. Dismissal of the complaint was an improper sanction under those circumstances and the proper sanction was cancelation of the hearing and a remand to the agency for a final decision on the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure to participate in the prehearing conference and subsequent failure to respond to the administrative judge's notice to show cause was not considered contumacious conduct in <span class="Italic">Saucedo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10965 (2002). The Commission reversed dismissal of the complaint and remanded it to the agency for issuance of a final decision on the record. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McGhee v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120055426 (2007) (complainant's failure to file prehearing submission and respond to agency's summary judgment motion warranted cancelation of hearing and remand for a decision on the record); <span class="Italic">Ricchini v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03665 (2002) (complainant's failure to respond to judge's orders was not sufficient to warrant complaint dismissal where complainant contended that he thought he had responded to judge's order or maybe he had misplaced his response).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shumate v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A11420 (2002), the Commission held that dismissal was too harsh a sanction and cancelation of the hearing and remand for a final agency decision was appropriate where the complainant refused to participate in a settlement conference and then failed to respond to a show cause order. In <span class="Italic">Shumate</span>, the complainant did have his representative, who was authorized to act in his behalf in settlement matters, participate in the conference. Given the representative's participation in the conference, even the sanction of cancelation of the hearing seems somewhat harsh.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reversed a sanction of dismissal of hearing request in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101994 (2014), when a nonattorney representative failed to file a notice of appearance in response to the administrative judge's acknowledgment order. The administrative judge also found that the complainant and his representative failed to comply with his order to read <span class="Italic">"</span>Frequently Asked Questions about the Federal Sector Hearings Process" posted on the Commission's website. The Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidentiary record reveals that Complainant's representative participated in the AJ-held prehearing conference on January 5, 2010, and had been identified by name, address, and telephone number on the formal complaint filed by Complainant. Although the AJ, through the Acknowledgement Order and the prehearing teleconference, advised Complainant that he must reaffirm his representation for the Commission by completing and returning the Designation of Representative form, the totality of the evidence made available during the prehearing conference and contained in the ROI shows that all interested parties had notice of the identity of Complainant's representative and his contact information by January 5, 2010, a week before the January 12, 2010, deadline and over three weeks before the AJ issued the January 29, 2010, Show Cause Order. That this information was not reiterated in a specific document does not justify dismissal of Complainant's request for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's hearing request was also dismissed for his failure to certify that he and his representative had read the information on the federal sector hearings process posted on the Commission's website. Commission regulations provide that an AJ shall receive into evidence information or documents relevant to the complaint, and that agencies and complainants shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence as the AJ deems necessary. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e) and (f). The regulation found at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e) clarifies that an EEO administrative hearing is part of the investigatory process, and thus gives the AJ authority to develop "an impartial and appropriate factual record upon which to make findings on the claims raised by the written complaint." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.108(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's failure to certify that he and his representative had read the Commission's information booklet on the hearings process did not impede the taking of testimonial or documentary evidence relevant to or necessary for an adequate adjudication of the claim at hand, nor otherwise of necessity would have impeded the AJ's development of an impartial or appropriate factual record sufficient to make a finding as to whether discrimination had occurred as alleged. Thus, we find that Complainant's noncompliance in this regard also does not justify dismissal of Complainant's request for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission understands the importance of ensuring compliance with AJ orders. When issued, sanctions must be appropriately tailored to match the effects of the noncompliance. Complainant's noncompliance with the AJ's orders in this case did not extend to prejudicing the opposing party, delaying justice, or impacting the integrity of the EEO <span id="Page_624"></span>process, as neither the AJ nor the Agency was denied information they did not already possess or otherwise needed. Dismissal of Complainant's hearing request without addressing the factors referred to in the cases cited above does not comply with Commission guidance. Therefore we hold that, that under these circumstances, the AJ abused her discretion when she dismissed Complainant's request for a hearing.</p>
