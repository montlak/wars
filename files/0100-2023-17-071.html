<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-72"><span class="space">a.</span> Agency Delay</h5>
<p class="noindent">An investigation that took the agency 330 days to complete warranted a default judgment against the agency in <span class="Italic">Miguelina S. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720160012 (2018). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Miguelina S.</span> upheld the sanction, rejecting the agency's argument that it did not have sufficient notice of the potential for sanctions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ determined that default judgment in favor of Complainant was the appropriate remedy. The Agency maintains that it had no notice that failure to complete the investigation within 180 days could result in default judgment or sanctions. While we generally have held that an AJ must first issue Notice to Show Cause before issuing sanctions, we have also noted that sanctions can be issued when the non-complying party had an opportunity to submit an opposition to the motion for sanctions prior to issuance of the AJ's sanction order. <span class="Italic">See Ross H. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720180001 (May 17, 2018) (agency given adequate notice of potential for sanctions when Complainant submitted motion for sanctions to AJ for failing to conduct an adequate investigation, and the Agency responded to the motion); <span class="Italic">see also Miller v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01735 (June 18, 2004) (noting that "we consistently provided the party the opportunity to respond prior to the issuance of sanctions, whether by issuing that party a show cause order. . .<span class="Italic">or</span> by permitting the party opposing sanctions an opportunity to submit an opposition to the motion for sanctions prior to issuance of the AJ's sanction order" (emphasis added)). In this case, the Agency was provided with a copy of Complainant's Motion for Default Judgment and an opportunity to respond. The Agency responded in opposition to Complainant's Motion on February 4, 2013. As such, we conclude that the Agency was provided with adequate notice that it may be subjected to sanctions, including default judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, Request No. 052008052 (September 25, 2009), the Commission affirmed an AJ who sanctioned an agency with default judgment because it did not complete the investigation in a timely manner. Additionally, Commission regulations and precedent provide AJs with broad discretion in matters relating to the conduct of a hearing, including the authority to issue appropriate sanctions, including a default judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e); EEO MD-110, at Ch. 7 (Aug. 5, 2015); <span class="Italic">Matheny v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30373 (Apr. 21, 2005). Therefore, we find that in this case, the AJ had the authority to sanction the Agency for untimely completion of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it should not be sanctioned with default judgment because fewer than 11 months elapsed between the date when Complainant filed her formal complaint and the date on which it sent the investigative file to her; the delay was attributable to the fact that two EEO Counselors had medical issues that affected the travel schedule of Agency personnel; the Agency completed the investigation before Complainant requested a hearing; the delay did not prejudice or harm Complainant; and EEO regulations give complainants the option to request a hearing or file a civil action if an investigation is not completed within the regulatory timeline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that 150 days late is not a minor departure from a 180-day deadline. In fact, the Agency took almost twice as long to investigate this case as is mandated by the regulations. Such an extreme violation of the applicable time limit will likely result in delayed resolution of a complaint and threatens the availability of relevant witnesses and documents. Not only does such a violation have negative consequences on Complainant's ability to obtain a resolution of her complaint within a reasonable amount of time, but it also undermines the ability of the EEO process to address unlawful employment discrimination in federal employment. Consequently, the Commission has previously found that sanctions are warranted in this circumstance. <span class="Italic">See Royal v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (sanction where agency was 62 days late in completing investigation affirmed); <span class="Italic">see also Complainant v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132260 (July 15, 2015) (sanction affirmed where agency took 308 days to complete investigation, instead of 180 days mandated by EEO regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, although the illness of two EEO Counselors may have somehow contributed to a backlog in EEO processing, it is not sufficient to justify such a significant delay. After all, investigators, not EEO Counselors, are charged with investigating EEO complaints. Moreover, the Agency should have adequate EEO staffing so that employee absences will not result in significant delays in EEO complaints processing. Further, while the travel schedules of Agency personnel may pose a challenge in acquiring information from witnesses, an agency is responsible for ensuring that its employees fully cooperate with the investigation in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the fact that Complainant did not request a hearing before the Agency completed its investigation does not mitigate the seriousness of the Agency's violation of EEO regulations here. Although complainants may request a hearing or file a civil action before the investigation has been completed if an Agency has not completed the investigation in a timely manner, they are not required to do so. Consequently, we find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion when he issued default judgment in favor of Complainant as a sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Matheny v. Attorney General</span>, 07A00045 (2002), the Commission found the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in issuing a default judgment in favor of the complainant on three claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations provide, in relevant part, that a party which "fail[s] without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to an order of an administrative judge, or requests for the investigative <span id="Page_601"></span>file" is subject to the imposition of one of several sanctions, up to and including "a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party. . .." 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3). A showing that the non-complying party acted in bad faith is not required<span class="Italic">. See Cornell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (November 24, 1998). Rather, it is within the administrative judge's discretion to impose sanctions where the non-complying party fails to show good cause for the conduct at issue<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The sanction imposed should not be so severe as to result in inequity, but should not be so lenient as to fail to serve as a deterrent<span class="Italic">. See Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency had possession of the remanded complaints and the new third complaint for more than 180 days without concluding the investigation of the third complaint. The agency failed to respond to AJ-2's initial April 21, 1999 inquiry regarding the consolidated cases. The agency then failed to respond to AJ-2's July 6, 1999 order. The agency claims not to have received the July 6, 1999 order, but the order was properly served on the agency and was not returned undelivered. The agency responded to the October 12, 1999 show cause order telephonically, promising to forward the two investigative reports which had long been completed, and to forward the third report when it was completed. The agency, however, failed to reply to AJ-2's directive to respond to the show cause order in writing, and delivered to AJ-2 only the correspondence files for the first two complaints, and those not until November 12, 1999. Further, the files were accompanied by a letter dated June 11, 1999 which addressed only AJ-2's oriGINAl April 21, 1999 inquiry. The agency did not respond to the show cause order in writing until December 30, 1999, again promising to forward the investigative files for all three complaints, noting that the investigation of the third complaint had been completed. Nonetheless, as of March 27, 2000 the agency still had not provided the investigative reports to AJ-2, and in fact did not do so until after she issued her decision of that date imposing sanctions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency posited arguments against the imposition of the sanction chosen by AJ-2, including that the illness and subsequent departure of the Assistant Director precluded timely response, and that it had not acted in bad faith. The Commission, however, finds the agency's arguments every bit as unpersuasive as AJ-2 found them. While the agency may not have acted in bad faith, no such showing is required. Further, the explanation proffered by the agency does not rise to the level of good cause shown<span class="Italic">. See DaCosta v. Department of Education,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000). The agency's non-compliance transpired over the course of roughly one year. It is inconceivable that the agency, once aware of the Assistant Director's incapacity, failed to make adequate provision to carry on the routine business of the EEOS. Such conduct shows clear disregard for the integrity of the EEO process. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, as well as those further expressed by AJ-2, the Commission finds that AJ-2 properly imposed the sanction of a finding in favor of complainant as to all claims of the three complaints for which the agency failed to provide investigative reports.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Germain v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 07A10048 (2002), the Commission found the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in granting default judgment where the agency delayed in submitting the investigatory file and there was also significant evidence that the agency delayed processing the complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Germain</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter before us, the record establishes that the agency failed to comply with orders issued by the AJ on two occasions. Indeed, the agency does not dispute this fact. Moreover, both orders indicated that failure to comply could result in sanctions, up to and including a decision in favor of complainant, as the Commission requires. This being so, sanctions are properly imposed unless the agency can meet the burden of showing "good cause" for its failure to comply with these orders. 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency attempts to belittle the importance of its failure to comply with the AJ's orders by noting that it ultimately sent the complaint file after a two and a half month delay, it offers little explanation for why it never responded to either of the orders. The agency argues that the inadequate performance of personnel in its OCR office and the substantial workload within OCR caused the delay in providing the file, but remains silent on the question of why, even after receiving an Order to Show Cause, it did not bother to contact the AJ and explain the delay. Instead, it argues that it has taken steps to prevent such delays in the future. We note, however, that the agency's concession that the "inadequate performance" of OCR personnel caused the delay and its pledge to prevent such delays in the future, does not establish good cause for the agency's failure to comply with the orders. The agency is responsible for the inadequate performance of its employees. The agency also argues that complainant already had a copy of the Report of Investigation (ROI) and that its failure to provide the AJ with a copy did not, therefore, impair complainant's ability to prepare his case. Prejudice to complainant is irrelevant in this case, however, as the purpose of the sanction is to deter the agency from ignoring an AJ's orders in the future. The agency cannot avoid its responsibility to respond in a timely manner to the AJ's orders by asserting that complainant already had a copy of the ROI. Accordingly, we find that the AJ properly determined that the agency failed to show good cause for its failure to comply with his orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the agency's contentions regarding the alleged impropriety of the default judgment as a sanction are without merit. The Commission has previously upheld the issuance of a default judgment as a sanction for the agency's failure to comply with orders issued by an Administrative Judge<span class="Italic">. See Janda v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10018 (March 4, 2002) (upholding AJ's issuance of decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for agency's failure to respond to complainant's discovery requests in accordance with AJ's order compelling responses and failure to response to AJ's order to show cause); <span class="Italic">Magruder v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01984820 (March 17, 1999) (upholding AJ's issuance of decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for agency representative's failure to appear timely at the hearing), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05990640 (March 9, 2001); <span class="Italic">Pachecho v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970691 (November 25, 1998) (upholding AJ's issuance of a decision in complainant's favor as sanction for agency's failure to provide complainant with relevant evidence, failure to respond to pertinent objections, failure to file timely motions and failure to comply with discovery orders); <span class="Italic">Telles v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980931 (November 25, 1998) (upholding AJ's issuance of a decision in complainant's favor as sanction for agency's refusal to reserve a room for the hearing and failure to appear without good cause).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the record, it is apparent that the agency's failure to respond to the AJ's orders is merely the final manifestation of its chronic failure to properly process complainant's complaint. The record establishes that complainant filed his complaint on January 23, 1995 and that when an investigation was not completed within 180 days, complainant sent a request for a hearing to the agency's EEO office. Instead of forwarding this request to the appropriate EEOC office, as it was required to do pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.108(g), the agency ignored the request and issued an acceptance letter in which it accepted three of complainant's allegations and dismissed two. Moreover, the agency failed to properly identify complainant's complaint as a mixed-case complaint, properly appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), causing further delay. After this situation was resolved, complainant requested that the agency reinstate and continue to process his complaint as an EEO complaint on July 26, 1999, yet the agency took no action for almost a year. Finally, the agency continued its processing delays when it failed to respond to first one and then a second order issued by the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we cannot find that the AJ abused his discretion in choosing to sanction the agency through the issuance of a decision partially in complainant's favor. As noted above, sanctions may be used not only to equitably remedy the opposing party, but also to deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future<span class="Italic">. See Hale,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Given the history of the processing of the subject complaint, which is rife with error and delay, and the agency's contumacious repeated failures to respond to the AJ's orders, we find that a lesser sanction would not deter the agency from similar conduct in the future. The agency's argument that the sanction of default judgment cannot be imposed without a finding of bad faith is without merit<span class="Italic">. See DaCosta,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> (In determining whether a sanction should be imposed, "the legal question to be resolved is not whether the agency acted in bad faith, but rather, whether the agency has shown good cause" for its inaction). Similarly, the agency's argument that the record establishes that complainant was not subjected to discrimination is irrelevant, as the AJ's finding was not based on the record, but on the agency's failure to respond to his orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the AJ's finding that complainant was subjected to disability-based discrimination when the agency failed to provide him with reasonable accommodation and thereby subjected him to constructive discharge was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gilberto S. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120162353 (2018), the Commission declined to issue a default judgment against the agency as a sanction for its 500-day delay in issuing its final agency decision, noting "that there was no delay by the Agency in initiating the investigation, and Complainant has not made a showing that he was prejudiced by the Agency's delay in issuing the FAD."</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Salvatore B. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2019005314 (2021), the Commission found that 398 days to issue a final decision did not warrant default judgment against the agency as it did not result in prejudice. The Commission noted a series of cases with similar lengths of delay where sanctions were not appropriate:</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency failed to comply with the Commission's regulations. In this case, it took 398 days for the Agency to issue the initial final decision from the date it had completed the supplemental investigation. In that decision, the Agency failed to address the claims raised in Complainant's amendment. Seven months later, the Agency issued its second decision addressing the additional two claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_602"></span>Although the Agency failed to issue a timely decision as required by regulation, we find that the Agency did not act in a manner to warrant a default judgment sanction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>. <span class="Italic">Josefina L. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 0120142023 (July 19, 2016), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520170108 (Feb. 9, 2017) (finding that the Agency's 571-day delay in issuing the decision did not warrant sanctions, as complainant did not show she was prejudiced by the delay); <span class="Italic">Abe K. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141252 (Nov. 4, 2016) (declining to sanction an agency that issued a decision after approximately 326 days when complainant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay); <span class="Italic">Jocelyn R. v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120152852 (Mar. 11, 2016) (citing <span class="Italic">Vunder v.

Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019003380 (Sept. 22, 2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Salvatore B.</span> did admonish the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant's request that the Commission sanction the Agency because of the length of time that it took to issue a complete final decision in this case, we decline. While we will not impose a sanction in the present case since the delay in issuance of the Agency decision did not prejudice Complainant or result in an unconscionable delay in justice, we do find the Agency's failure to abide by the regulations reflects negatively on the Agency's support for the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Beatrice B. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019001641 (September 17, 2020) (The Commission declined to issue a sanction where following a supplemental investigation, the Agency delayed in issuing a final decision for over eight months).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, we will notify Federal Sector Programs (FSP) which monitors the federal agencies' EEO programs of the Agency's failure to comply with the regulations regarding the timely issuance of its final agency decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rhinesmith v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A10103 (2003), the Commission agreed with the agency that it had not engaged in contumacious conduct but upheld the sanction of a default judgment because the agency had not raised any of its arguments before the administrative judge. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Rhinesmith</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency that its failure to respond to the Administrative Judge's directives did not amount to contumacious conduct. The Commission has generally not regarded a party's failure to respond to an Administrative Judge's order as constituting contumacy. The Commission found that contumacious conduct occurred in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980746 (September 19, 2000) when complainant cursed the Administrative Judge, impugned his character, showed disrespect for the agency's attorneys, and made personal and unprovoked attacks on participants in the hearing. We thus conclude that the Administrative Judge's characterization of the agency's conduct as constituting contumacy was in error, but we are not persuaded by the agency that the issuance of a decision in complainant's favor was inappropriate under the circumstances of the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the sanction contemplated was too harsh because the failure to timely produce the complaint file was neither willful nor deliberate. The agency also argues that a lesser sanction would have sufficed to deter its conduct and equitably remedy complainant. We acknowledge that these arguments have merit. However, we also find that in order for the Commission to find that the Administrative Judge abused his discretion in sanctioning the agency as he did, the agency should have raised these arguments before the Administrative Judge issued his decision, rather than after the issuance of the decision. At the time the Administrative Judge issued his decision, no agency representative had offered any explanation for the agency's failure to comply with the orders issued from the Hearings Unit, despite notice that the agency's failure to do so could result in a default judgment for complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Janda v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10018 (March 4, 2002), the Commission affirmed an Administrative Judge's issuance of a default judgment in favor of complainant when the agency failed to respond to complainant's discovery requests and to complainant's motions for sanctions. In Janda, the Administrative Judge found that the agency never proffered an explanation for its inaction but conceded that its representative displayed a "non-cooperative attitude." Upon review of the record before us, we find that the agency failed to proffer an explanation for its inaction and did not concede its negligence until after the April 17, 2001 Decision on Liability was issued. Accordingly, based on the information the Administrative Judge had when he issued his decision, we find that he did not abuse his discretion in sanctioning the agency by entering a decision fully in complainant's favor.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3)(v).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, after a careful review of the record, including arguments and evidence not specifically discussed in this decision, the Commission reverses the agency's final order and directs the agency to take corrective action in accordance with this decision and the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Reading v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40125 (2006), the Commission upheld the sanction of default judgment where the agency had not even assigned an investigator to the case when the 180--day investigatory time limit passed. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Reading</span>, also rejected the agency's argument that the delay had not prejudiced the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Violation of EEOC's Part 1614 Regulation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e) requires agencies to complete an investigation of a formal EEO complaint within 180 days of the filing of the complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period for not more than an additional 90 days. The complainant did not agree to an extension during the regulatory 180 day period; therefore the agency was required to complete the investigation of the complainant's complaint on or before November 25, 2003. The record demonstrates, and the agency does not dispute, that no investigation was ever begun, much less completed, within the 180-day period. As noted by the AJ, the record reflects that the agency did not assign an investigator to investigate complainant's case until February 9, 2004. In finding that sanctions were warranted against the agency, the AJ permissibly found that the agency had not assigned an investigator until well after the 180 days to complete the report had expired and after complainant had requested a hearing. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency failed to conduct a timely investigation of the complainant's complaint as required by EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. Part 1614. <span class="Italic">See DaCosta v. Dept. of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000); <span class="Italic">Cornell v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (November 24, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Imposition of Sanctions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party. <span class="Italic">Buren v. Unites States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05850299 (November 18,1988). The procedures contained in the Commission's Regulations are no more or no less than the necessary means to eliminate unlawful employment discrimination in Federal employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the Commission must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations. The Commission has exercised its inherent authority to enforce its Part 1614 Regulations by ordering sanctions in response to various violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the Commission's inherent authority to enforce its Part 1614 Regulations, EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3) authorizes administrative judges and the Commission on appeal to take one of four specified actions, or any such other actions deemed appropriate, where an agency or its employees fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to an investigator's requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witnesses. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3) provides sanctions for a party's failure to respond fully and timely to requests for evidence in the hearing context. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.404(c) provides sanctions for a party's failure to respond to the Commission's requests for the submission of evidence following an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's decisions summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. In reaching this conclusion, we note that EEOC Regulations provide AJ's with broad discretion in the conduct of a hearing, including such matters as discovery orders and the drawing of adverse inferences and other sanctions. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Ortega v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01956818 (February 5,1998); <span class="Italic">Malley v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01951503 (May 22,1997). Initially, we note that the agency does not dispute the AJ's finding that it did not assign an investigator to investigate the instant case until well after the 180 days for completion of the investigation required by the Regulations. Further, contrary to the final order's conclusion, the agency not only failed to comply with the Commission's Regulations at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e), but failed to comply with the AJ's discovery order to complete an investigation of complainant's complaint allegations in a timely manner. The agency alleges that its failure to investigate complainant's formal complaint within 180 days did not prejudice complainant. However, the agency's inaction does not nullify the Commission's inherent authority to sanction the agency's failure to fulfill its duty to investigate, or to otherwise provide for the prompt, fair, and impartial investigation of the complainant's complaint, within 180 days of the date she filed the complaint. The agency contends that it was at a disadvantage in investigating the complaint as complainant refused to cooperate with the investigator, and that it acted in good faith in attempting to complete the investigation. The Commission notes that the Regulations do not require that the agency exhibited "bad faith" as a prerequisite to the imposition of sanctions. Addressing the agency's contentions, the record indicates that complainant was hospitalized in March of 2004 and declined to provide a statement letter when contacted by an investigator in January of 2004. However, contrary to the final order, we note that complainant had requested a hearing before an AJ on January 5, 2004, and declined to provide the requested statement due to her belief that all discovery at that time would be instigated by the AJ. In addition, we note that the request <span id="Page_603"></span>for a statement from complainant was made more than six months after complainant filed her formal complaint. Finally, complainant's counsel stated that complainant was available to cooperate with the investigation following the filing of the complaint, but the agency took no steps to investigate the claim until February 9, 2004, well after the 180 days for completion of the investigation as provided for in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency has not provided any documentation or explanation for its failure to investigate the complainant's complaint within 180 days of its filing, that is, on or before November 23, 2003. We find no evidence other than the agency's allegations that complainant refused to cooperate in the investigation of her complaint prior to her requesting a hearing. The record indicates that complainant refused to submit the requested letter in January of 2004, or more than 180 days after the formal complaint was filed. It appears from the pleadings to the AJ that beginning in January of 2004, the agency was never ignorant of its responsibility to have the complaint investigated, but it merely initiated attempts to do so at that time. While the record indicates that the agency's RC did not receive the AJ order directing production of the report of investigation from February 9, 2004, we nevertheless note that the investigation was not completed within 180 days of the date complainant filed her formal complaint. After an independent review of the evidence, the Commission finds that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in issuing a decision favorable to complainant as a sanction against the agency for its dilatory investigation and discovery practices. <span class="Italic">DaCosta, supra; Cornell, supra</span>. Therefore, after a careful review of the record, including arguments and evidence not specifically discussed in this decision, the Commission REVERSES the agency's final order and REMANDS the matter to the agency to take corrective action in accordance with this decision and the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency failed to produce the report of investigation within the time limit established by the administrative judge, there was good cause for imposing a sanction but default judgment was too harsh a sanction. In <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A50030 (2007), the complainant requested a hearing after the expiration of 180 days and prior to completion of the investigation. As is customary, in the acknowledgment order, the administrative judge gave the agency 15 days to produce the complaint file, including the report of investigation. The order also advised the agency it could be subject to sanctions for failing to produce the report. The agency responded by indicating the investigation had been conducted and it would forward the report as soon as it received it.</p>
<p class="noindent">A month later, the administrative judge again gave the agency 15 days to produce the report or show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. The judge noted that sanctions could include judgment for the complainant. The agency did not timely produce the report, nor did it seek an extension of time. By the time the agency produced the report some two weeks later, the judge had imposed the sanction of default judgment against the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal, the Commission upheld the decision to impose sanctions, but modified the sanction imposed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gray</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriate to address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). Factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is, in fact, warranted, would necessarily include the extent and nature of the non-compliance, to include the justification presented by the non-complying party; the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; and, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proper sanctions, according to the Commission, were "prohibiting the agency from using affidavits or exhibits contained in the ROI to support either a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment. . .and not allowing the agency to rely on affidavits contained in the ROI in lieu of witnesses who are unavailable either to testify at the hearing or provide testimony by other means. . .." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Gray</span> case muddied the waters with regard to sanctions for failure to timely complete investigations considering the Commission's decision upholding a sanction of default judgment against the agency in <span class="Italic">Reading v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Commission is clearly taking a more aggressive posture in sanctioning agencies that fail to timely complete investigations, but the parameters of the sanction to be imposed remain unclear.</p>
<p class="noindent">The more aggressive posture appeared again in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070045 (2007). In that case, the complainant requested a hearing after the formal complaint had been pending for over 180 days. The agency then forwarded an incomplete complaint file to the administrative judge. The day after the complainant filed a motion for sanctions, the agency filed a report of investigation with the judge and provided a copy to the complainant. In response to a show cause order, the agency argued that it had not failed to investigate the complaint, but merely delayed the investigation. It also argued that the complainant suffered no prejudice from the delay. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Royal</span>, rejected an argument that default judgment punished the medical center facility and not the EEO office responsible for the investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e), agencies must complete an investigation of a formal EEO complaint within 180 days of the filing of the complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period for not more than an additional 90 days. Here, complainant did not agree to an extension during the regulatory 180-day period, therefore, the agency was required to complete the investigation of complainant's complaint on or before October 28, 2006. The record reveals, and the agency does not dispute, that no investigation was ever begun, much less completed, within the 180-day period. The record reflects that the agency did not assign an investigator to investigate complainant's case until November 9, 2006. The Commission finds that the agency has not provided any documentation or explanation for its failure to investigate the complainant's complaint before October 28, 2006. It appears from the agency's responses to complainant's initial hearing request and the AJ's Order to Produce dated October 13, 2006, that the agency was well aware of its responsibility to have the complaint investigated, but it intentionally delayed doing so. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency failed to conduct a timely investigation of the complainant's complaint as required by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party and must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3) authorizes administrative judges to sanction a party for failure to respond fully and timely to requests for evidence in the hearing context. After an independent review of the evidence, the Commission finds that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in issuing a decision favorable to complainant as a sanction against the agency for its dilatory investigation. <span class="Italic">See Reading v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720040125 (October 12, 2006);<span class="Italic"> DaCosta v. Department of Education,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000). Therefore, after a careful review of the record, including arguments and evidence not specifically discussed in this decision, the Commission REVERSES the agency's final order and directs the agency to take corrective action in accordance with this decision and the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also upheld an award of default judgment in <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070039 (2007). In that case, the complainant requested a hearing and the agency was ordered to produce the complaint file. The agency did not produce the file, but contended the request for a hearing was premature because 180 days had not elapsed since the filing of the formal complaint. The complainant resubmitted his request for a hearing 30 days later. The agency then sent the complaint file to the administrative judge without the report of investigation and informed the judge that the investigation was not complete. In fact, the agency did not authorize the investigation to start until a few days before the complainant resubmitted his hearing request.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, rejected an agency argument that the delay in investigation was due to lack of resources:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations require that the agency "shall complete its investigation within 180 days of the date of filing of an individual complaint" and may be extended by agreement of both parties. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e). In this matter, complainant was not asked, nor did he agree to an extension, and, given his eagerness for a hearing, it appears doubtful that he would have so agreed. The record is clear and the agency does not dispute that it did not initiate an investigation within the 180-day period, that it did not assign an investigator until November 9, 2006, and that, by her own testimony, she did not begin the investigation until December 7-28 days after her appointment.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Investigative Report, p. 1, December 13, 2006. The agency, through the undated statement of WMG, offered the agency's explanation for its delay. WMG described the workload of her office, that it had received 275 complaints in 2006, 78 during the months of May, June, and July; that she had seven investigations in her office in January 2007; and that her procedure is to assign the oldest cases first and attempt to meet the 180-day requirement to complete each investigation. Notwithstanding WMG's description of the agency's general process, her statement does not provide a specific explanation for its failure to initiate an investigation of complainant's complaint until more than 180 days after he filed his complaint; for its failure to seek an extension of time from complainant; or for the investigator's delay until December 7, 2006, to begin the investigation, which postponed its investigation for another month. Given the agency's actions, the obvious conclusion is that the agency failed to conduct a timely investigation of complainant's complaint or follow the procedures required by the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative processes from abuse by any party and must ensure that agencies and <span id="Page_604"></span>complainants follow its regulations. Moreover, our regulations authorize administrative judges to sanction a party for failure to respond fully and timely to requests for evidence and information. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). The agency's internal situation cannot be used as a defense to its failure to comply with the Commission's regulations. Finally, we note that the procedures provide for extensions of time. Before imposing a sanction, an AJ may consider a complainant's refusal, if given the reason for the agency's request, to agree or not agree to an extension. The agency, however, may not simply ignore the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After an independent review of the evidence, the Commission finds that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in issuing a decision in favor of complainant as a sanction for the agency's failure to conduct a timely investigation or to take other action in accord with our regulations. <span class="Italic">See Reading v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720040125 (October 12, 2006); <span class="Italic">DaCosta v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000). We have carefully reviewed the record, including the arguments and evidence tendered by the parties, including those not specifically addressed in this decision. The Commission agrees with the AJ that the agency discriminated against complainant as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed its decision on reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520080115 (2007), once again rejecting the agency's arguments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the agency filed this request to reconsider. In its request, the agency stated: (1) in sanctioning the agency, the AJ considered only the effect of the agency's failure to complete the investigation within 180 days on the integrity of the EEO process, but did not consider whether the facts of the case warranted a less severe punishment; (2) the Commission likewise gave no consideration of various factors, and focused only on the fact that the agency did not complete their investigation within 180 days, failed to initiate the investigation until one (1) month after the Investigator was assigned to the case, and its belief that the agency failed to follow the procedures required by the Commission's regulations; (3) the AJ and Commission should have concluded that the application of Commission precedent to the facts of the case did not warrant a finding of discrimination without consideration of the merits of the case; (4) WMG offered mitigating factors for consideration by the AJ and the Commission, including increased workload in 2006 and budgetary issues; (5) more appropriate sanctions should include not allowing the agency to request additional time during the hearing process; (6) ordering the agency to pay discovery costs resulting from (he delay in the investigation; (7) prohibiting the agency from requesting summary disposition during the hearing. Complainant responded to the agency's request to reconsider. Among other things, he asked that the decision of the AJ's be sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After consideration of the agency's request to reconsider and the evidence of record, we find that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in issuing a decision in favor of complainant as a sanction for the agency's failure to conduct a timely investigation or to take other action in accord with the Commission's regulations. Although we note the decisions in <span class="Italic">Voysest, supra</span> and <span class="Italic">Gray, supra,</span> we find that the record indicates that AJ considered the particular circumstances in this case surrounding the agency's failure to investigate complainant's allegations within the time required in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e),--and considered the statements of WMG, offering the agency's explanation for the delay--and nevertheless decided to sanction the agency for its admitted failure to conduct a timely investigation of complainant's complaint. As found by our prior decision, the agency's internal situation regarding budgetary problems and backlogs of EEO complaints cannot be used as a defense for its failure to comply with the Commission's regulations. Also, as stated in the prior decision, the Commission's regulations authorize AJ's to sanction a party for failure to respond fully and in a timely manner to requests for evidence and information. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). We find that while the AJ could have given the agency a lesser sanction for its failure to conduct a timely investigation, it was within her authority under the Commission's regulations to sanction the agency as she did. As such, we cannot find that the AJ abused her discretion in sanctioning the agency by issuing a decision in favor of complainant in order to address the agency's failure to comply with the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also reaffirmed its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520080052 (2009). Responding to the agency's argument that the delay in the completion of the investigation was not intentional and of only a short, two-month duration, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Royal</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the matter, we find that the AJ's decision to sanction the agency was proper. The AJ duly notified the agency, by order dated January 30, 2007, that it must show good cause for its failure to complete the investigation of complainant's complaint within 180 days of the date on which the complaint was filed. The agency, as noted above, claimed that it did not fail to investigate, but merely delayed the investigation, and that complainant had not been adversely affected by the delay. The agency further claimed that complainant has a history of abusing the EEO process and that a decision in favor of complainant would harm the VA Medical Center, as opposed to the agency entity that is responsible for conducting EEO investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plainly, the AJ did not credit the agency's explanation as "good cause" for its failure to timely investigate the complaint. We note that the agency cited no authority in support of the proposition that willful delay in processing a complaint is perforce less harmful to a complainant's cause, nor less a violation of the integrity of the EEO process, than the flat-out refusal to investigate a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the agency has cited no authority in support of its argument that its delay should be excused because of financial constraints. We have seen this argument raised before in the context of disability accommodation. It is well-settled that an agency may not establish undue hardship as a defense to providing reasonable accommodation based on the financial resources of one component of its operations. Rather, we look at the agency's financial resources as a whole. <span class="Italic">See Preston v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120054230 (August 9, 2007); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p). Likewise, when considering whether an agency has the fiscal resources to comply with the requirements of the EEO process, it is appropriate to look to the agency as a whole. As complainant has persuasively argued, it is the agency's decision as to how it allocates its funding; the agency cannot expect to evade the consequences of its funding decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's delay in completing the investigation within the 180-day regulatory period is no small non-compliance matter. Such a delay warrants a sanction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DaCosta v. Department of Education, supra</span> (agency's lengthy delay in initiating and completing investigation of complaint within 180 days of filing was clear violation of EEO regulations, and of EEOC s orders, which warranted sanction of agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Royal</span>, also again rejected the agency's argument that the sanction of default judgment was not tailored to the circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is, in fact, warranted, include: (1) the extent and nature of the non-compliance, including the justification presented by the non-complying party; (2) the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; (3) the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; and (4) the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of Defense, supra; Voysest v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A35340 (January 18, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the default judgment in complainant's favor is warranted in this case for the reasons which follow. The agency's argument emphasizes that the delay in completing the investigation was very short (62 days), and that the cause of the delay was not an intentional act designed to prejudice complainant personally. The agency also argued that the complainant did not suffer any actual prejudice caused by the delay. However, given the length of time that the processing of a federal sector EEO complaint can take, any delays past the time frames in the regulations can impact the outcome of complainant's claims. Witnesses may retire or leave the agency, often without notice, or documents may be misplaced or destroyed (either intentionally or not) when the responsible party is not notified to maintain the documents as relevant to an ongoing EEO investigation. The agency's assertion that complainant did not suffer any prejudice is speculative, at best.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency's argument focuses on the first three factors, which consider the impact of the agency's non-compliance on an individual complainant, we find that in the case where an agency has not initiated an investigation that could reasonably be completed within the 180-day time frame, the fourth factor, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process, is paramount. Protecting the integrity of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector. As we noted in our previous decision, the Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party and must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations. We have previously issued cases in which we have affirmed actions taken by AJs which were designed to bring to account an agency's non-compliance with the regulations or with Orders issued by an AJ. <span class="Italic">See Matheny, supra</span> (Commission affirmed its right to issue default judgments); <span class="Italic">Waller v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720030069 (May 25, 2007), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070689 (February 26, 2009) (Commission affirmed its right to issue monetary sanctions in the administrative process). <span class="Italic">See also Footracer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A46020 (September 25, 2005) (Commission affirmed adverse inference drawn by AJ when agency witnesses discussed testimony with one another); <span class="Italic">Elston v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A50019 (October 18, 2005), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A60283 (January 5, 2006) (Commission affirmed default judgment issued by AJ).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency had not assigned an investigator until November 9, 2006, 192 days after complainant had filed her formal complaint, (May 1, 2006). Under the regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e), <span id="Page_605"></span>an agency has 180 days from the filing of a formal complaint to complete the investigation. At day 180, the agency may ask the complainant to extend the period for investigation for an additional 90 days. Alternatively, a complainant may request a hearing before an AJ after day 180, even if no investigation has been completed. The regulations contemplate that the AJ would then oversee the completion and development of the record in that instance, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(a). Here, as noted above, the investigation was not commenced until day 192, and complainant requested a hearing on day 197.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the similar cases of <span class="Italic">Reading v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40125 (October 12, 2006) and <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070039 (October 2, 2007), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080115 (December 26, 2007), the agency waited until past day 180 to begin an investigation. An AJ issued a default judgment in Reading when the agency had failed to assign an investigator until after the 180-day period had passed, failed to provide the AJ with the investigative file when ordered and failed to provide any reason to the AJ for its failure to do so. Our decision in that case affirmed the importance of the agency's compliance with the regulations and its obligation to complete a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation of a complainant's complaint. We also emphasized the Commission's inherent power to protect the administrative process from abuse by either party. In Lomax, we affirmed the issuance of a default judgment, also for failure to conduct a timely investigation. We again emphasized our power to protect the integrity of the EEO process, and noted that the "agency's internal situation cannot be used as a defense to its failure to comply with the Commission's regulations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argued that the facts in the instant case are similar to those in <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of Defense, supra,</span> and that as precedent, <span class="Italic">Gray</span> would dictate that the default judgment be reversed. We distinguish this case from the facts in <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, in that in the instant case, the agency had not begun the investigation until after the 180-day period had expired and complainant had requested a hearing. In <span class="Italic">Gray,</span> however, the agency had begun the investigation 55 days into the 180-day period, and was delayed from completing it, in part, by the actions of the complainant when she disagreed with the definition of the issues to be investigated, and asked the investigator for an extension of time to complete her rebuttal statement, notwithstanding that she had already requested a hearing. We found in <span class="Italic">Gray</span> that, although a sanction was appropriate for failure to produce the investigative record in accordance with the AJ's Order to Show Cause, the AJ had abused her discretion in the selection of a default judgment as a sanction, and should have more narrowly tailored the sanction imposed. In <span class="Italic">Gray,</span> unlike in the case at bar, the agency had engaged in actions showing intent to comply with our regulation specifying that an investigation shall be completed in 180 days.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case where the agency failed to produce the complainant file on the order of the administrative judge because it had not started the investigation, the judge refused to impose any sanction and, on appeal, the Commission determined that the judge erred in not doing so. However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120132260 (2015), the Commission, followed <span class="Italic">Gray, supra</span>, and declined to impose a sanction of default judgment. In imposing the sanction of not allowing the agency to rely on affidavits in support of motions to dismiss or for summary judgment and not allowing the agency to rely on the affidavits at hearing of any witness who was unavailable to testify, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant argues that a default judgment in her favor would be an appropriate remedy in this case. We note, however, that sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. We find that a more narrowly tailored sanction rather than a decision fully in favor of Complainant would be appropriate here. We acknowledge that the Agency did not even begin to investigate Complainant's complaint until January 25, 2013, after 281 days had elapsed from the time she filed her complaint. We note, however, that the Agency, although in an untimely fashion, did complete the investigation and provide Complainant with the [missing text]. We also note that Complainant participated in the investigation, and we can fund no specific evidence that Complainant was directly harmed by the delay. Further, the limited record before us does not establish that Complainant's claims of discrimination are supported at this juncture. Notwithstanding, we find that the Agency's delay and its failure to comply with the Commission's regulations must not be overlooked here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the facts of this case, the AJ could have selected an evidentiary sanction such as not allowing the agency to rely upon affidavits contained in the ROI in lieu of witnesses who are unavailable to testify at a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Gray</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(F)(3)(iii) and (v)). Such a sanction would effectively emphasize to the agency the need to comply with AJ orders, as well as relevant timeframes during the investigation of EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, we reversed the AJ's decision, which issued a default judgment against the Agency, and instead remanded the case for a hearing as a sanction for the agency's failure to complete its investigation within the 180-day period. In finding that a default judgment was not appropriate, we noted that complainant was not harmed by the delay and she continued to participate in the investigation while the case was pending a hearing. We further noted that there was no evidence available to the AJ to support a finding of discrimination at that stage. We therefore instructed the AJ to instead issue the evidentiary sanction of not allowing the agency to use the affidavits or exhibits contained in the ROI to support its motion for a decision without a hearing. This effectively remanded the case for a hearing as a sanction. We also ordered that the agency could not rely upon affidavits contained in the ROI in lieu of witnesses who were unavailable to either testify at the hearing or provide testimony by other means authorized by the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Gray, supra</span>, Complainant participated in the investigation, and the limited record before us does not establish that Complainant's claims of discrimination are supported at this juncture. As such, instead of a default judgment, we find that the evidentiary sanction of not allowing the agency to use the affidavits or exhibits contained in the ROI to support either a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment to be more appropriate. Moreover, during the hearing, the Agency may not rely upon affidavits contained in the ROI in lieu of witnesses who are unavailable to either testify at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the AJ reinstated Complainant's claims, including claim 1 (performance award), which the Agency dismissed in its July 18, 2012, Partial Acceptance/Dismissal We note further that the Agency only accepted Complainant's promotion claim for investigation, and therefore, when the AJ issued his decision finding no discrimination with respect to the reinstated claims (including claim 1), he did so without an investigative record. As such, the AJ issued his decision without a complete record, especially with regard to claim 1. Therefore, we are unable to determine whether the AJ properly issued a decision without a hearing due to the incomplete record, and find again that remanding this case for a hearing is the most appropriate outcome here. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Defense</span>, Appeal No. 0120114192 (Sep. 16, 2014) (unable to determine whether the AJ properly issued a decision without a hearing due to the incomplete record; remanding the case for a hearing on the merits was the most appropriate sanction) (citing <span class="Italic">Vu v. Social Sec. Admin</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120012632 (Jan. 20, 2011); <span class="Italic">Shehata v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102315 (May 9, 2012)).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720090009 (2015), the Commission upheld a default judgment imposed by the administrative judge that took into account the agency's conduct in previous cases involving the complainant where the agency mailed the complaint file one day late:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the default judgment in Complainant's favor was not an abuse of discretion for the reasons which follow. Default judgment is an appropriate sanction for the infraction, the mailing of the complaint file one day late, especially based on the history of the Agency and Complainant. We note that the AJ and Complainant have both emphasized the Agency's past conduct and failures in its processing of Complainant's previous EEO cases. This same AJ imposed a default judgment against the Agency in Complainant's previous EEO complaint, [ ] III. In the previous complaint, the Agency had failed to issue Complainant a notice of right to file, failed to accept her complaint for processing, and failed to investigate the issues in Complainant's complaint. The Agency did not contest the default judgment in that case. Although the Agency represented that it had implemented positive steps to correct its processing deficiencies at SJAF Base, we find that the processing of the instant case still failed to adhere to the time frames contained in the regulations and those contained in the Orders of the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other appeals of default judgments issued by AJs for failure to comply with the requirements of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process, the Commission has affirmed the default judgments, in the interest of protecting the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Royal v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (Sept. 25, 2009); <span class="Italic">Reading v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40125 (Oct. 12, 2006); <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070039 (Oct. 2, 2007), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520080115 (Dec. 26, 2007); <span class="Italic">Elston v. Dep't. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50019 (Oct. 18, 2005), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A60283 (Jan. 5, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant mailed a copy of her April 9, 2005, hearing request to the AJ and to three different offices at the Agency, two of which were located on SJAF Base. The Agency was presumably on notice then, before the receipt of the AJ's April 15, 2005, Order Directing the Agency to Produce Complaint File, that it would be required to submit the complaint file to the AJ within 15 days of receipt of the hearing request. Complainant argued that the Agency received her hearing request on April 14, 2005, and was therefore required to produce the file by April 29, 2005. The AJ alternatively calculated the Agency's deadline to submit the file using the date on which the Agency received the AJ's Order, finding that it was <span id="Page_606"></span>due within 15 days from April 20, 2005, or by May 5, 2005. The Agency postmarked the file on May 6, 2005. By either date, the Agency was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the sanction of a default judgment was appropriately tailored by the AJ to impress upon the Agency the need to comply with AJ Orders, as well as the relevant timeframes of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Suit v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120082737 (2010), the Commission did not review the administrative judge's order granting default judgment because the agency did not file an appeal. The Commission did, however, note the circumstances leading the judgment which included failure to issue an acknowledgment or acceptance of the complaint, failure to conduct an investigation, a failure to respond to a show cause order and, finally, a response that did not demonstrate good cause but merely admitted that the agency had not conducted an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Montes-Rodriguez v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120080282 (2012), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant's conduct at the prehearing stage excused its delay in conducting an investigation. The Commission had previously remanded the case and ordered the agency to provide the complainant with a report of investigation within 150 days and the agency did not initiate the investigation for slightly over 200 days. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Montes-Rodriguez</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Protecting the integrity of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." <span class="Italic">Id. (quoting Royal,</span> EEOC Request No. 0520080052). An Agency which treats the time deadlines for production of an adequately developed investigation as optional has a negative effect on the outcome not only of the immediate case, but also of any other cases under its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> The Commission must insure that all parties abide by its regulations and orders. Our decision to issue a default judgment will effectively emphasize to the Agency the need to comply with Commission orders in a timely manner, as well as ensure that future Agency investigations are adequately developed for adjudication.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant requested a final agency decision and the agency did not issue on until 371 days after the expiration of the 60-day period for doing so, the Commission, on appeal, imposed a sanction of default judgment. In <span class="Italic">Glynda S. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120133361 (2016), the Commission first noted that the complainant could not file an appeal until the agency issued its decision. That finding, as noted above in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-17-005.html#sec8-6">Failure to Issue Final Agency Decision</a>," is at odds with previous cases holding that a complainant could appeal after the expiration of the 60-day period if no decision was issued.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Glynda S</span>., the Commission, noting that the agency provided no explanation for its delay, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding this case, we note that, under the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 Regulations, a complainant cannot appeal her case to the Commission until a final decision has been issued. Unlike situations in which a complainant may request a hearing when an agency has not completed an EEO investigation in a timely manner, or a complainant may opt to file in federal District Court when 180 days have passed after the filing of an appeal, a complainant who has requested a final decision cannot bypass the Agency's inaction/delay by raising the matter with the Commission, Instead, EEO regulations require an agency to issue a final decision before the Commission can address the matter on appeal. Thus, it is especially imperative that an agency issue final agency decisions within the regulatory time limits. In this case, the Agency's extreme delay stranded Complainant in a procedural "no man's land" wherein she had no recourse within the administrative EEO process until the Agency issued its final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that our regulations require agency action in a timely manner at many points in the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Tammy S. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120084008 (June 6, 2014). Compliance with these timeframes is not optional; as the Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052, "the Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party and must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations." Because of the length of time it can take to process a federal sector EEO complaint, any delays in complying with the time frames in the regulations can impact the outcome of the complainant's claims. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, the Agency's extraordinary tardiness undermined the integrity and effectiveness of the EEO process. Additionally, the Commission has previously warned the Agency that its lengthy delay in issuing final decisions was a serious matter of concern. <span class="Italic">Sylvester v. Dep't of Justice (Bureau of Prisons)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120101890 (Nov. 18, 2010). Therefore, we find that the Agency's delay warrants the severe sanction of granting default judgment in favor of Complainant. Moreover, default judgment should impress upon the Agency its need to henceforth issue final decisions in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected an argument that the agency did not have sufficient notice of the complainant's hearing request and the administrative judge's notice to produce the complaint file in upholding default judgment in <span class="Italic">Giza v. Attorney General</span>, 0720100051 (2011). In that case, the agency had given the administrative judge three separate addresses to send notices, the hearing transcripts and decisions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Giza</span>, also noted that some of the agency's responses on appeal were not under oath and were disingenuous:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this record, we do not find that AJ1 abused her discretion in issuing a default judgment against the Agency. Complainant requested a hearing in late August 2008, and the Agency was aware of Complainant's request as well as the fact that her request was submitted prior to the completion the investigation. The Agency completed its investigation in early September 2008. The Agency has never explained why it did not promptly send Complainant a copy of the report of it investigation and her right to request a hearing. We presume this is because the Agency knee Complainant had already requested a hearing. Consequently, the Agency was well aware of its obligation to submit the complaint file to the Hearings Unit. There is no explanation in the record for why it took almost six months after Complainant's request for a hearing for the Agency to submit the complaint file.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency devotes considerable argument to the issue of the correct address. On appeal, the Commission queries why the Agency has failed to give us an adequate explanation as to why an Administrative Judge expected to use no less than three different Agency addresses, depending on the nature of the document being sent. However, it has not persuaded this Commission that if an Administrative Judge sends an Order, directing the Agency to produce the complaint file or to show good cause, to the same office which the Agency demands that the hearing transcript, hearing exhibits and final AJ decision be ultimately sent, it is somehow excused from responding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with AJ2's conclusion that the Agency's response to AJ1's default judgment was woefully legally inadequate. Moreover, we find that the record supports AJ2's observation that, in this case, the Agency's actions sent:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the message that the Agency considers the administrative process to be one in which it can make material misrepresentations and omissions to explain its conduct in support of its request that a sanction be set aside, and to do so via documents that are not signed under oath and do not constitute evidence, thereby limiting the potential legal consequences of its misrepresentations and omissions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A default judgment is a serious sanction. Factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is, in fact, warranted, include the extent and nature of the noncompliance, the justification presented by the non-complying party; the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; the consequences resulting from the delayed injustice, if any; and, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (March 1, 2007); <span class="Italic">Hale v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). A sanction should be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In affirming both AJs decisions to impose/sustain a default judgment, we have considered what choice AJ1 had in the face of the Agency's "refusal to show up" as well as the casual response she received almost two months later as a justification for the Agency's inaction. We have also found AJ2's concerns about the integrity of the EEO process to be both persuasive and sincere. Finally, we have also reviewed Complainant's testimony regarding the suffering she endured as a result of the suspension and conclude from it that the consequences of delayed injustice would have been especially severe for her. For these reasons, we believe that imposition of this default judgment will deter the Agency from failing to expeditiously respond when hearings are requested in the future, as well as equitably remedying Complainant for her undeserved suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Adkins v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 0720080052 (2012), the complainant, a GS-14 attorney, alleged discrimination on the bases of race, sex and age when he was denied positions at other facilities after being notified that his facility would close. He also alleged that his employment would be terminated because he was not selected and instead chose to resign on June 30, 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the agency had completed the investigation by January 2001, it did not provide him with a copy of the ROI despite his requests. Finally, in February 2003, he requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge. The judge ordered the agency to produce the complaint file. The agency didn't respond within the 15 days, but 37 days later told the judge that it had amended the complaint to include a constructive discharge claim and that it was now processing the complaint as a mixed case and drafting a final agency decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant filed a motion for sanctions seeking default judgment. Three weeks later, the agency finally sent the complainant a copy of the investigation and informed him that it had amended his complaint to include a constructive discharge claim. The complainant renewed his request for default judgment and, at the same time, asked the judge to assume jurisdiction over the mixed case complaint because by now it was enmeshed in the EEO process. Before <span id="Page_607"></span>the judge could issue a ruling, the agency issued a final agency decision finding, of course, no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The judge, who still did not have access to the complaint file, issued an order to retain jurisdiction over the complaint, but permitting the complainant to appeal his alleged constructive discharge to the MSPB and hold the remainder of the claim in abeyance. The complainant did not file an MSPB appeal and no one informed the judge to stop holding the complaint in abeyance. Some four years later, the judge reaffirmed his order retaining jurisdiction over the complaint and issued a default judgment in favor of the complainant on his age discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Adkins</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues it had good cause for the 862-day delay in giving the investigative file to Complainant. First, it had a "good faith belief" that, according to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(d)(2), this was a mixed case complaint not under the EEOC's jurisdiction. Second, mixed case jurisdictional issues are "confusing," as noted by a treatise. Third, the Agency properly held the entire complaint in abeyance as part of the <span class="Italic">Filippini</span> class complaint. According to a declaration by the Agency's Chief of the Formal Complaint Section, the Agency had initially processed the complaint as a mixed-case complaint and had written a "rough draft" of the mixed-case FAD by May 8, 2001. But before it could issue the FAD, it had to hold the entire complaint in abeyance for 17 months, pending the outcome of the <span class="Italic">Filippini</span> class complaint. Hence, the two-year delay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that these explanations do not establish good cause for failing to timely provide the investigative file to Complainant. First, the Agency cites no authority or regulations that authorize federal agencies to withhold finished investigative files from complainants during the processing of mixed-case complaints or class complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Commission does not find credible the Agency's explanation for the delay, that it had been processing the complaint as a mixed case and holding the complaint in abeyance because of a related class complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We initially emphasize the lack of documentary evidence to support the Agency's account. There are no documents in the record indicating that the Agency processed the complaint as a mixed case complaint "in good faith" before the AJ ordered it to produce the complaint file on February 5, 2003. Neither the Agency's accepted issues for investigation nor the ROI's "Description of Claims" lists a constructive discharge claim. The Agency's own FAD determined that Complainant never alleged constructive discharge. Complainant never took an affirmative or independent step to raise such a claim. As such, we find no basis in the record for the Agency to have been justified in believing that Complainant alleged constructive discharge, and no documentary evidence indicating that the Agency had in fact processed this complaint as a mixed case complaint from 2000 to February 2003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the class complaint, we find no documentary evidence indicating that the Agency had actually held the complaint in abeyance during the processing of the <span class="Italic">Filippini</span> class complaint. For example, there is no evidence showing the Agency issued a decision notifying Complainant that his individual complaint was being held in abeyance. Nor did the Agency indicate in its initial March 14, 2003 letter to the AJ that it was still holding the complaint in abeyance because of a related class complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Besides the lack of documentary evidence to support its version of events, the Agency also gave inconsistent accounts of when it began processing the complaint as a mixed-case complaint. In its "motion for reconsideration," the Agency maintained that it had investigated the constructive discharge claim and included it in the ROI upon Complainant's retirement on June 30, 2000. But in its appellate brief to the Commission, the Agency claimed, without any reference to the record, that the Agency "recognized that the matter should be processed pursuant to mixed case regulations" after it received the finalized ROI on January 19, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Besides being inconsistent, the Agency also failed to account for a roughly five-month gap in its timeline for processing this complaint. According to the declaration of the Agency's Chief of the Formal Complaint Section, the relevant sequence of events occurred as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--January 19, 2001: Agency is sent the final ROI</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--February 20, 2001: Complainant requests a copy of the ROI</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--May 8, 2001: Agency completes a "rough draft" of the FAD</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--September 24, 2001: Filippini initiates informal EEO counseling</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--October 18, 2001: Filippini files his EEO class complaint</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Chief of the Formal Complaint Section stated in his declaration that the Agency had completed a "rough draft" of the FAD on May 8, 2001. But before it could issue the final version of the FAD, the Agency had to subsume Complainant's claims of age discrimination in the<span class="Italic"> Filippini</span> class complaint and hold his other claims in abeyance. The Commission notes, however, that the Agency had a five-month period from May 8 to October 18, 2001 to "finalize" the completed "rough draft" of the FAD. But the Chief's declaration does not explain why his office could not do so before the filing of the <span class="Italic">Filippini</span> class complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to offer any factual evidence or legal reasons to establish good cause for withholding the ROI from Complainant for over two-years. The Agency cited no authority that authorized it to withhold a finished investigative file from Complainant during the processing of the complaint. And given the lack of documentary evidence and inconsistent accounts of how the Agency processed the complaint, we do not find credible the Agency's stated reasons for the delay in processing the complaint. Finally, we add that the Agency cannot show good cause by merely alleging that it was confused by the literal wording of our regulations or ignorant of relevant decisions, illustrating how to apply mixed-case regulations and procedures in practice. Therefore, the Commission determines that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in finding that the Agency failed to show good cause for the delay in providing the ROI to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Adkins</span>, also upheld an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction against the agency even though the underlying claim was brought under the ADEA which does not provide for fees in the administrative process.</p>
