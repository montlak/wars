<h2 class="h2">CHARGE WRITING</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Making the decision to take action against an employee never comes lightly. Besides the anxiety of affecting their career and possibly their income, there are a multitude of other reasons why you can easily convince yourself that it's not worth it. The process of disciplinary or adverse action:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Can be lengthy.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Can affect morale.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May cause your supervisory efforts to be closely examined.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Offers employees various avenues to refute the charges.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May depreciate your authority if not upheld.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">It's no wonder that some managers avoid taking disciplinary measures. But avoidance rarely solves a problem. You must accept that it will be a long and bumpy road, but for the good of your agency and fairness to your other employees, it must be done when warranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Preparing a properly written charging document is the linchpin of your disciplinary actions. It will follow you and the employee throughout the entire disciplinary process, and it will be scrutinized at every level. If misconduct is not properly charged, the whole action can be rejected which can then empower the employee. The importance of getting it right can't be emphasized enough.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before you even begin to charge an employee, be sure to know the facts of the situation. Obtain or develop information that will identify facts to help you determine an appropriate course of action. Your role in the investigation is not to confirm your opinions or suspicions or to assume wrongdoing. Therefore, it's important to conduct investigations of misconduct in a calm, professional, impartial, and unemotional manner. If you're led to the conclusion that misconduct has occurred, understanding the facts will be the most reliable way for you to write the charge and address the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once you've completed the investigation and reviewed the evidence, consult with your HR office. If you decide to propose an adverse action against an employee for misconduct, you're going to need to draft charges against the employee that will:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Put them on fair notice of the offense with which they are being charged.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Stand up on review if the employee appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">This can be the most difficult part of the disciplinary process. A poorly written charge can completely derail what would have been a well-deserved adverse action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Basics of charging</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">A charge is a brief description or labeling of the misconduct for which you are proposing the disciplinary or adverse action. The charge is a part of the proposal notice for the action you want to take against the employee. The practice is to state the charge and then give details of what the employee did, known as specifications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are four basics you should keep in mind about charging:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> To uphold an adverse action, only one charge need be proven.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> To prove a charge, all elements of the charge must be proven.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> To prove a charge, only one specification of the charge need be proven.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> To prove a charge, only so much of the specification as will establish the essence of the charge need be proven.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Caution:</b> You should avoid using a large number of charges in a proposed removal because it can be viewed as piling on charges. If the separate instances of misconduct are spread out over a long period of time, the MSPB may question why the supervisor didn't propose less serious discipline earlier. That could have given the employee a chance to learn from his errors. The MSPB may doubt the credibility of the agency's arguments about the seriousness of the misconduct.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Structure of charge</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Charging employees is similar to the criminal justice system of charging defendants with specific violations of criminal codes and their multiple options. A prosecutor presented with somebody who killed another person has to decide whether to charge the defendant with murder, manslaughter, reckless endangerment, or any of a variety of offenses that prohibit taking another person's life. Each of these are very different offenses with widely differing penalties. The laws that govern each offense specifically state what the elements of proof are that the government needs to establish.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unfortunately, the federal civil service doesn't have a detailed frame of reference like state or federal criminal codes. There is only the basic standard that says action can be taken against an employee if it promotes the "efficiency of the service." There is no master list of offenses or charges at either the governmentwide or agency level. Your agency's table of offenses and penalties only ensures consistency of penalties between similar types of offenses and does not identify the universe of charges that can be levied in response to employee misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What this means is that you can charge an employee in any way and with any combination of words. You just have to be able to prove the words you use, and then show that the offense described negatively affected the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Charges generally have two basic parts:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The label.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The details.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The label.</b> The label names the misconduct in a word or phrase and succinctly provides notice of the misconduct at issue. The charge label you use will depend on the underlying facts of the case. The simpler you keep it, the better.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Charge labels are usually referred to as "specific" or "generic."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Specific label.</b> A specific label is a word or phrase that characterizes the employee's misconduct. Some examples are:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Absence without leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Insubordination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Failure to follow leave procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">A specific label charge is precise and may be technical but usually doesn't provide any information as to the who, what, when, and where of the misconduct. A specific label charge relies on the details to meet the definition of the charge. These details provide the facts showing that the conduct satisfies the charge's technical definition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Elements of charge.</b> Most specific label charges have elements and proof requirements that are defined by case law, statutes, or regulations. For example, to prove a charge of AWOL, the agency would need to show that:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> The employee was absent.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> The absence was not authorized or a request for leave was properly denied.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">If you're not sure whether a specific label you're thinking about using has elements to prove, check with the HR office or legal counsel. Once you know the elements of the specific label charge, you need to look at your evidence and determine whether it proves those elements. If you feel confident that it does, you can move on to drafting the details of the charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you don't think you can prove all the elements of that specific label, you need to think about whether a different specific label charge would work better. It also might be a better idea to use a generic label charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Generic label.</b> A generic label does not specifically characterize the employee's misconduct, so it doesn't help explain the misconduct like a specific label would. However, because a generic label charge isn't specific, it doesn't have elements that you have to worry about proving. Here are some examples of generic labels:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Inappropriate conduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Conduct unbecoming.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Inappropriate behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Dishonest conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">As you can see, generic labels are essentially meaningless. They wholly depend on the description of the misconduct in the details of the charge. But generic labels are a useful option if you are concerned about using a specific label that will require you to prove a set of elements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The details.</b> The details of a charge tell the story of the "who, what, when, and where" of the employee's misconduct. In addition to laying out what occurred, these specifics allow the employee to make a meaningful, focused response to the proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you are using a specific label charge that requires you to prove a set of elements, the details of the charge should track the elements. Let's look at this sample AWOL charge:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i><b>Absence without leave:</b> On May 21, 20XX, you were scheduled to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. You did not report for work at all that day nor call in to request leave in violation of leave procedures.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The first sentence of the charge states when the employee was supposed to be at work. The first part of the second sentence ("You did not report for work at all that day") is evidence to prove the first element of an AWOL charge -- the employee was absent. The second part of the second sentence ("nor call in to request leave") is evidence to prove the second element of an AWOL charge -- the absence was not authorized. The last part of the charge ("in violation of leave procedures") shows the authority behind the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You don't need to state in the details what the elements of the charge are. You just need to describe the misconduct in a way that clearly provides the proof of each element. And in describing the misconduct, make sure that you have evidence that proves every word of the details of the charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Specifications.</b> Let's go back to the AWOL example. Say the employee was AWOL on three separate days instead under the same circumstances where he didn't call in to request leave. How would you handle that?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The most common way would be to have the single AWOL charge, and then break the details up into separate specifications of the absences. A specification is each independent description of misconduct included under a charge. In each specification, you would describe a single absence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">So, in this example, you would use the specific label charge "absence without leave" with three specifications, like this:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b><i>Absence without leave.</i></b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Specification 1: On May 21, 20XX, you were scheduled to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. You did not report for work at all that day or call in to request leave in violation of leave procedures.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Specification 2: On June 7, 20XX, you were scheduled to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. You did not report for work at all that day or call in to request leave in violation of leave procedures.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><i>Specification 3: On June 10, 20XX, you were scheduled to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. You did not report for work at all that day or call in to request leave in violation of leave procedures.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is only a single instance of misconduct, like in the original AWOL charge example, you don't need to label that one instance as a specification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Narrative charges.</b> There is no rule that says you need to put a label on a charge. A narrative charge doesn't use a label. Instead, it describes the misconduct in a paragraph or more. Basically, it's just the details without any label. And because there is no label, there is no set of elements that must be proved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The trouble with a narrative charge is that it can end up being an unfocused rant. The employee may be unsure of what to defend against, and the MSPB administrative judge doesn't know what the charged misconduct is. This could result in the AJ attaching his own label to the charge, and the agency's evidence may not be sufficient to prove the recharacterized charge.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Evidence</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To prove the charges, your agency will rely on evidence of the employee's misconduct. Evidence is any item, including testimony, documents, photographs, computer entries, etc., that tends to prove a fact. Let's take a look at some of the basics you need to know about evidence to understand how it affects drafting charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Direct vs. circumstantial evidence.</b> The first thing you need to understand is the difference between "direct evidence" and "circumstantial evidence" (also referred to as "indirect evidence").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Direct evidence is evidence in the form of testimony from a witness who actually saw, heard, or touched the subject about which they are being questioned. If believed, direct evidence proves the existence of the fact at issue without any additional reasoning or making an inference. This is the better type of evidence for proving your case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Circumstantial evidence is information and testimony that permit conclusions that indirectly establish the existence or nonexistence of the fact or event that the party is trying to prove. Circumstantial evidence isn't as strong as direct evidence. However, sometimes circumstantial evidence may be all you are able to gather during your investigation to prove certain points of your case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here's a simple example of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. Say you're trying to prove that it rained earlier in the day. Direct evidence would be testimony from a person saying she was outside in the rain and saw and felt the rain falling. If the witness instead testified that she went outside and the ground was wet and she saw puddles and a rainbow, that would be circumstantial evidence. The witness never actually saw or felt the rain, but she experienced circumstances that would permit a conclusion that it rained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Forms of evidence.</b> Evidence comes in many different forms and all may be introduced in order to prove the charge(s). Some evidence will weigh more heavily than other evidence, but that is for someone else to determine. Conduct your investigation as thoroughly as possible and let the evidence speak for itself. Here are some forms that you may encounter:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Testimonial evidence</b> or <b>testimony</b> is a witness's written or oral statement, made under oath, regarding what they know about the facts of a case.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Expert testimony</b> is given by an expert who has particular knowledge and experience which an ordinary person would not possess.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A <b>deposition</b> of a witness is taken prior to a hearing before a judge or arbitrator to allow the gathering of evidence. The deposition is taken under oath and is done in a question-and-answer format as if it were a hearing. For example, agency counsel could depose a witness to the alleged misconduct committed by the employee. The employee's representative may be present for the deposition and cross-examine the witness.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Documentary evidence</b> is commonly thought of as the paper trail and consists of any evidence in the form of documents. This evidence can be gained from anything that is written such as invoices, agency policy, travel logs, drug test results, and government credit card statements. Photographs, audio recordings, videos, and emails are also forms of documentary evidence.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Physical evidence</b> takes the form of an actual physical object, such as a desk, a book, equipment, or a vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Weighing the evidence.</b> "Weight of the evidence" refers to how persuasive evidence is. When an AJ at the MSPB weighs the evidence, they will consider the value of the total evidence presented by the employee as compared to the evidence presented by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Standard of proof -- preponderance of the evidence.</b> The term "standard of proof" refers to the amount of evidence that a party must offer to win its case. In an appeal to the MSPB, an agency must be able to prove that the charged misconduct occurred by a "preponderance of the evidence." The preponderance of the evidence standard requires the agency to present enough evidence to show that it is more likely than not that the alleged misconduct happened.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Gathering evidence.</b> So how do you get all this evidence? A fact-gathering investigation needs to be conducted. Managers at most agencies are not generally called upon to conduct extensive investigations. However, they often are required to develop information in connection with emerging workplace situations even if only to determine whether further investigation is necessary.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Intent vs. non-intent charges</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">It's easy to immediately think of what the charge will be when presented with an employee misconduct situation. But try not to be so hasty. Characterizing the behavior too quickly and sticking with it can lead you down a difficult path when proving the charge. You'll be better off if you examine the facts of your investigation and see where they lead you. Then decide how to state the charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The pitfall is that many specific label charges -- such as "falsification," "insubordination," and "theft" -- require proof of intent. The problem with an intent charge is that there is rarely any direct evidence of intent, and therefore, it is hard to prove.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Intent charges.</b> Intent is a state of mind that usually must be proven through circumstantial evidence. If certain events or conditions are proven, intent can be inferred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This inference adds another step for an agency to establish, and the strength of an inference is largely subjective. While the agency must carefully select and prove its circumstantial evidence, it has little control over the inference since the strength of the inference is in the eyes of the beholder. Because it's difficult to determine whether an inference will be found, bringing an intent charge can be a gamble.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Let's take a look at an example. If an employee indicates on an application that he has never been convicted of a crime, it may be tempting to charge falsification if it's found that he previously pleaded guilty and was convicted of a crime.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, the falsification charge will fail on appeal if the employee is able to show that he was confused by a plea bargain and reasonably believed that there would be no conviction on his record. If the employee responded "no" because he was mistaken rather than because he intended to deceive the agency, he has not engaged in falsification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you choose to go with an intent charge in an adverse action, you should:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Produce clear, credible evidence indicating intent.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Stress that when certain things are done, people generally intend or expect certain results.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Determine and be ready to counter the employee's probable explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Non-intent charges.</b> As an alternative, you may want to use a non-intent charge, which is easier to prove. For example, the employee can be charged with "providing inaccurate information" rather than "falsification," "failure to follow instructions" instead of "insubordination," and "unauthorized possession" rather than "theft." You can also use a generic label like "inappropriate conduct" or "conduct unbecoming" and then describe the misconduct in the details.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a big advantage to using non-intent charges, especially if you don't have an airtight case on an intent charge. Many agencies use the practice of "charging down and proving up." This allows the agency to bring a non-intent charge but use intent to enhance the penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Intent examples.</b> Here are some of the most common charges requiring proof of intent. You may use these charges, but you must be able to rebut any plausible explanations the employee may come up with about what they were thinking when they committed the misconduct. You must prove that the employee intended to do it.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Falsification/Making False Statements.</b> Knowingly supplying wrong information with the intent to deceive or mislead. The agency will have to prove that the deceit had a wrongful purpose. The gain or advantage need not necessarily be financial nor must it be personal. Be careful not to use this charge if the employee was simply negligent, careless, or lazy.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Insubordination.</b> Willful and intentional refusal to obey a lawful order of a supervisor or superior. The agency will have to prove that the employee failed to follow instructions and did so willingly and intentionally. The employee may be able to explain that they were having a bad day, misinterpreted the order, got sidetracked, or meant to follow the order.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Theft.</b> Taking with the intent to deprive the owner permanently of possession and use of their property. The agency must prove that the property was taken, and the employee intended to keep it. The employee can argue that he brought the property home (for example, a laptop) to work on a project and forgot to bring it back. After five years, he completely forgot he had it. Intent may be proven if the employee sold the property or admitted that he never intended to bring it back.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Willful Vehicle Misuse.</b> Willfully using a government vehicle for nonofficial purposes. The agency must prove that the employee voluntarily used the vehicle with full knowledge that the use was not for official purposes or that they acted in reckless disregard as to whether or not the use was for nonofficial purposes. If proven, the intentional misuse of a government vehicle requires a mandatory minimum penalty of a 30-day suspension if it is brought under statute.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Non-intent examples.</b> Here are some of the most common charges that do not require proof of intent. The reason why the employee did it becomes irrelevant when you're charging something that doesn't require intent. All of these charges allow you to address misconduct without trying to figure out what the employee meant to do, or was willfully doing, or their intention.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Failure to Follow Instructions.</b> All you have to prove is that you gave the employee proper instruction and the instruction wasn't followed.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Poor Judgment.</b> Examines if the incident is inconsistent with the mission of your agency. You need to explain why the employee's actions exhibited poor judgment and the reasons why it matters to your agency.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Lack of Candor.</b> You have to be able to prove that the employee gave incorrect or incomplete information, and they did so knowingly. Lack of candor does not require you to prove intent to deceive, but it does involve an element of deception. This charge is often used when an employee fails to disclose negative information during an investigation or on an official form.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Conduct Unbecoming/Inappropriate Conduct.</b> You only have to show that the employee did something that was not appropriate for an employee in the position they hold or for a federal employee. Behaviors that may fall under this charge are abuse toward the public, being detained by law enforcement with or without arrest (especially if you're a law enforcement agency), and disrespectful conduct (like rudeness, insolence, or indifference).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Improper Associations.</b> Personal, unprofessional, or off-duty relationships with the "wrong" people such as felons, undocumented immigrants, informants, and inmates. Such relationships or contacts innately undermine the credibility of the agency, employee, or both and bring public criticism, particularly to law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Specifications</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of the specifications is to provide notice to the employee and to describe what happened. Once you have chosen the label you will use, you need to draft the specification(s). This separate part of the charge expands on the short label, telling the reader what specific misconduct the employee engaged in. Only information that is essential and can be proven should go in the specification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A good specification is a clear, concise, tightly focused description of the misconduct. The specification will determine whether a charge succeeds or fails.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most specifications can be drafted using the same pattern: "On [date], at [time], you [factual description of misconduct]." The specification should outline the elements of the charge in its description of the events that occurred. Citations to rules and regulations, laws, terms of art, and characterizations do not belong in the specification unless they are unavoidable.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Four Ws</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The specification explains the "four Ws": who, what, when, and where. Only these essential facts should be included in the specification. Any additional information belongs elsewhere in the proposal notice. Answering the four Ws in the specification will enable the employee to make a meaningful, focused reply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "rule of the four Ws" serves to focus on the importance of the specification in:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Answering questions of why the specified misconduct was inappropriate or unbecoming, and why it satisfies the efficiency of the service.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Providing notice of the charged misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Limiting the specification and stopping the specification from going beyond its proper role.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any information beyond the four Ws most likely belongs in the penalty analysis, a nexus statement, or a background or context paragraph. Remember these important points about the four Ws:</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Everything else goes elsewhere in the proposal notice. Otherwise, the agency assumes the risk of being required to prove additional and unnecessary information.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If something is not intended to be proven, it should not be put in the specification.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The specification should factually detail or track the charge's elements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Just the facts.</b> The key information should be provided factually. It should not be provided in terms of characterizations, buzzwords, or conclusions. For example, if you want to charge an employee with disorderly conduct, you don't want to write a specification like, "The employee committed assault and battery on his supervisor." "Assault and battery" is a characterization that is a legal conclusion that shouldn't be presented as a fact. Instead, you should factually recount that on a certain date, at a certain place, the employee hit his supervisor and the specifics of how it occurred. It should read something like:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b><i>Charge: Disorderly Conduct</i></b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b><i>Specification:</i></b> <i>On May 24, 20XX, in the employee parking lot, you caused bodily injury to your supervisor by throwing objects, punching him with your fists, hitting him with a bat, and brandishing a knife.</i></p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you include conclusions or characterizations, such as "He intended to do harm to..." or "The employee willfully attacked ...," you will insert elements that the employee will challenge or the MSPB will examine closer. Even if your charge label stays clear of intent, using words in the specification that imply intentional misconduct may require your agency to prove that element of intent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The MSPB may examine the language in the specification to determine how charges are to be construed. Words such as "knowingly," "willfully," "maliciously," and "intentionally" will risk the MSPB converting an otherwise non-intent charge to one that requires proof of intent. The specification should be a factual summary -- that's it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Recharacterization</b> -- <b>terms of art and citations.</b> A term of art is a word or phrase that has a precise, specialized meaning within a particular field or profession. Charges can be recharacterized if a term of art is used in the specification, especially if it is a generic charge. Here are some common terms of art that you should avoid using in a charge:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Defraud.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <i>Ex parte</i> communication.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Falsify.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Hostile work environment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pains and penalty of perjury.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Sexual harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Threat.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any intent charge -- falsification, insubordination, theft, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Case examples.</b> Here's a case that shows the danger of using terms of art or characterizations in the specification. An agency charged the employee with "submitting altered documents." By using the term of art "altered documents," the agency put itself in danger of recharacterizing the charge as falsification, which requires proof of intent. Unfortunately, the agency then added to its burden with a specification stating that the employee submitted "fabricated" documents and "that he knowingly and intentionally furnished altered documents... [to] defraud the Postal Service." With that, there was no way for the agency to get around the burden of having to prove falsification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, "citation charges," in which the agency seeks to define or describe the misconduct with reference to a regulation, statute, or agency policy statement, can become a problem. If the agency uses the citation in the charge label, it should count on being required on appeal to prove that the employee violated the regulation, statute, or policy. This is often unfortunate because the citation is often nothing more than further elaboration on the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In one case, an agency included the statutory citation in the charge and was required to prove the citation. Even though the agency could have proven the underlying charge of unauthorized removal, it could not prove the citation (duty to protect property). This contributed to a 45-day suspension being reduced to a five-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Prove one specification and prove the charge.</b> Where there is one charge with multiple factual specifications, proof of one or more of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge if the adverse action is appealed to the MSPB. This means that an agency can meet its burden of proof on its charge even if it proves only one of multiple supporting specifications. Proof of one specification is sufficient to prove the charge as a whole.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Writing charges can be very tricky, so you need to work with your HR staff to prevent taking an adverse action that is reversed on appeal. Here are some potential problems to watch out for when writing charges:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Pile on charges.</b> This can result in the agency losing credibility. If the agency allows the employee to engage in several acts of the same misconduct over a period of time and doesn't take any action against the employee, the MSPB will question why the agency didn't take less serious action sooner to allow the employee to correct his behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>State anything but facts in the specifications.</b> You should be able to prove every word that is included in the specification. If you can't, you should delete or revise what you are not sure that you can prove.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Include terms of art, buzzwords, or conclusions in the specifications.</b> If you use terms of art, buzzwords, or conclusory terms, you will have to prove them for the MSPB to uphold the specification (and in turn, the charge).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Use an intent charge if you don't have sufficient evidence</b> to show the employee intended to engage in the misconduct. There is rarely direct evidence of an employee's intent because it involves the employee's state of mind. That means you have to rely on circumstantial evidence, and that the AJ and the MSPB will be able to infer intent from that evidence. This is usually difficult to achieve.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Use a citation charge if you can't prove violation</b> of each element of a statute, regulation, or policy. The MSPB will require you to show that the provision was violated. If you can't, the charge will fail even if you labeled the charge something like "inappropriate use of a government vehicle" or "misconduct involving the agency email system."</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What the best charge format to use to make sure charges hold up on appeal?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> There's not really a "best" way to format a charge. It really depends on the specific circumstances of the incident(s). You have to consider all the evidence you've gathered to figure out the best approach.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How much evidence do we need to prove charges?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The "standard of proof" -- the amount of evidence that the agency must offer to win its case -- in an appeal to the MSPB is a "preponderance of the evidence." This requires the agency to present enough evidence to show that it is more likely than not that the alleged misconduct happened. Don't get too preoccupied with how much evidence you need to collect. You need to focus on gathering all the evidence that you can.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Wouldn't it make more sense to charge an employee with "insubordination" rather than "failure to follow instructions" to show that the misconduct was serious and calls for removal?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Not if you don't have enough evidence to prove that the employee's refusal to obey an order was intentional and willful disobedience. It's usually difficult to prove intent because there is rarely any direct evidence of it since intent is a state of mind of the employee. So most of the time the agency has to attempt to prove intent with circumstantial evidence and hope that the AJ and the MSPB can infer intent from that evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency instead charged the employee with "failure to follow instructions," it doesn't have to prove intent for the charge to be upheld on appeal. The agency can then use any evidence of intent in the penalty section of the proposal notice to support removal rather than a lesser penalty. This strategy is called "charging down and proving up."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What's the point of using a charge like "inappropriate conduct" if it doesn't really mean anything? If we want to remove the employee for something he did, obviously his conduct was inappropriate.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Because a generic label charge isn't specific, there aren't elements that the agency has to worry about proving, as is the case with specific label charges. A generic label charge is wholly dependent on its specifications (the description of the misconduct). If the agency is concerned about characterizing the charge and having to prove all the elements of a specific label charge, a generic label charge may be the better option.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What are some pitfalls to watch out for when I'm describing the misconduct?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The most important thing you need to do when writing a specification -- the description of the misconduct -- is to include only the facts. Make sure that you can prove every word in the specification; if you can't, you should delete what you can't prove. Beware of using terms of art like "altered document" or conclusory terms like "threat" because the agency will have to prove the definitions ascribed to those terms. Also, make sure that if you describe the misconduct in reference to a regulation, statute, or policy, you can prove that the employee violated that provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I'm not sure whether I can prove intent if I charge the employee with "theft of government property." Can I also charge him with "unauthorized removal" and "unauthorized possession," which don't require proof of intent?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If you just list these three charges with the same specifications for each, it's very likely that the MSPB will merge or lump together the unauthorized removal and unauthorized possession charges into the theft charge. Each charge needs to be factually or legally distinct. You can't just call the same offense different names. If the action gets appealed to the MSPB, you're likely going to end up with one charge. And if you can't prove intent on the theft charge you're left with, the action will be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In this situation you could simply not charge the employee with theft, and just charge unauthorized removal and/or unauthorized possession. You can use any evidence of the employee's intent in the penalty section of the proposal notice to support a more serious penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. "Falsification," "misrepresentation," "lack of candor," ... all those charges sound like the same thing to me. What's the difference?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The main difference between the terms is whether they require the agency to prove intent. These charges can refer to many different offenses, including providing inaccurate information on timesheets, padding expense reimbursement claims, omitting information on employment applications, and providing false responses during an investigation. A charge of "falsification" or "misrepresentation" requires the agency to prove that the employee knowingly supplied incorrect information and that he did so with the intention of defrauding the agency. This can be difficult since it usually requires the agency to prove the employee's state of mind with circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because of this, agencies often avoid using the charge "falsification" or "misrepresentation" in all but the most airtight cases. Instead, they will use charges that do not require proof of intent, such as "lack of candor" or "providing inaccurate information."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I want to remove an employee for excessive tardiness, which has been happening regularly for the past couple of years. Should I include charges for each time the employee was tardy since I haven't previously taken action against her?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You should avoid using a large number of charges in a proposed removal because the MSPB may view it as piling on charges. If the separate instances of tardiness are spread out over a long period of time -- such as the past couple of years -- the board may question why you didn't propose less serious discipline earlier. Reprimands or suspensions could have given the employee a chance to correct her tardiness issues.</p>
