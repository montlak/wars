<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-16"><span class="space">7.</span> Preference of Employee</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is the Commission's position that if more than one accommodation is effective, "the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration; however, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations." <span class="Italic">Wade K. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020004593 (2022); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR 1630.9; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, Q. 9 (Oct. 17, 2002). The agency may also consider its own needs in determining which of two possible accommodations is most reasonable. Ultimately, the complainant is entitled to reasonable accommodation and not the accommodation of his choosing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g,</span> <span class="Italic">Frisch v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A43048 (2005) (complainant not entitled to accommodation requested where alternative accommodation is effective); <span class="Italic">Nutter v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A51902 (2005) (holding agency's provision of wheelchair service was an effective accommodation even though employee preferred handicapped parking space); <span class="Italic">Gergis v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A34566_r.txt">01A34566</a> (2004) (holding employee was entitled to transfer to warmer climate, but not location of his choice); <span class="Italic">Parramore v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A42484 (2004) (holding employee presented no evidence that alternative jobs were offered in bad faith or that she could not perform them); <span class="Italic">Mehta v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A22872 (2003) (holding complainant was not entitled to have troublesome duties removed from his job as an accommodation where agency offered him a motorized wheelchair for mobility that would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of his position). As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Dupree v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51299 (2006), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> 29 CFR 1630.9, "It is the Commission's position that if more than one accommodation is effective, 'the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration; however, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations.'" Just as the employee is entitled to reasonable accommodation as opposed to the accommodation of choice, the agency also is not required to create a position as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Dailey v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101705 (2011) ("The Rehabilitation Act does not require that the Agency: (1) offer an individual the accommodation of her choice, only that it offer an effective accommodation; or (2) create a job as a form of accommodation."); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120081046 (2011) (agency not required to create job as accommodation to satisfy employee's preference).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected an argument in <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120110907 (2012), that the agency's preferred accommodation was demeaning and, thus, not reasonable and also found that the complainant had failed to cooperate with the agency in implementing his preferred accommodation. The complainant contended that the agency failed to provide him with adaptive technology to complete online EEO training and that having the trainer coordinator read slides to him that he could not read was demeaning. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While an individual may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, he is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice. The accommodation provided must be effective. Under the circumstances herein, the Agency offered Complainant effective accommodations. Moreover, the Agency was trying to resolve problems that arose with the assistive technology that Complainant preferred, and Complainant was unwilling to cooperate. We acknowledge Complainant's frustration, but the record does not support a finding that the Agency's efforts to ensure that Complainant enjoyed the same benefits and privileges of employment as employees without disabilities were insincere or that the Agency engaged in a pattern of providing "makeshift" accommodations that were ultimately ineffective. For these reasons and under the circumstances herein, we decline to find the Agency liable for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130043 (2015), where the complainant sought accommodations for his carpal tunnel syndrome to take a data entry test. The complainant requested a gel wrist pad, which the agency provided, a scribe and additional time to take the test. The agency provided as an accommodation that the complainant could reschedule or retake the exam without penalty if a flare-up of his condition prevented him from taking the test. In finding that the agency had offered an effective accommodation, even if it was not the accommodation of the complainant's choosing, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency indicated that a scribe was not necessary because the examination did not require the test taker to mark any answers or responses; rather, it was administered entirely on a computer keyboard or keypad. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the Agency determined that since the purpose of the test was to measure both the test taker's speed and accuracy in data entry, an extension of time would render the resulting test score useless as a true indicator of the individual's performance speed. AJ Decision, p. 6. Therefore, the Agency determined that a more narrowly-tailored and appropriate accommodation was for the Agency to modify its examination policy to permit Complainant to reschedule or retake the examination, without penalty, if the pain in his hand prevented him from taking the test. AJ Decision, p. 20. The AJ concluded that the Agency did provide effective accommodation and that Complainant failed to provide evidence that the Agency did not provide a sufficient accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant took the examination with the accommodation, but did not pass. AJ Decision, p 7.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sakima v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871796 (1988), the employee contended that the agency failed to make reasonable accommodation of his disabling condition when it reassigned him from the carrier craft to the clerk craft. The employee in <span class="Italic">Sakima</span> contended that the agency could have restructured a carrier position, rather than move him to another craft:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In examining the reasons articulated by the agency for reassigning appellant, we first note that appellant's position is well taken in that both the agency's regulation as well as the OWC [Office of Workers' Compensation] guidelines required the agency to make an effort to assign him to a position in his craft before reassigning him to another craft. Moreover, we find that the agency misconstrued the law and the duty to provide reasonable accommodation in holding that appellant could not be accommodated in the carrier craft because he was unable to perform all the essential functions of this craft without endangering his health. Pursuant to EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.704(b), reasonable accommodation may include, <span class="Italic">inter</span> <span class="Italic">alia</span>, job restructuring. As such, it was well within the agency's authority to modify the carrier position that appellant was assigned to in order to avoid him having to lift, carry, or perform any other activity which could compromise his health.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, while we find that retention in a light duty carrier craft position was a form of accommodation which the agency was required to consider, it was not the only form. The record shows that appellant's assignment to the clerk craft also constituted a reasonable accommodation of his handicap. Thus, the issue in this case is not whether the agency failed to reasonably accommodate appellant, but whether, in providing reasonable accommodation, the agency is required to provide an employee the accommodation of his or her choice. We find that no such obligation exists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to be reasonable, accommodation should be individualized, but it does not necessarily have to be tailored to meet an employee's preference. It has been determined that reasonable accommodation rests on the need to consider a person's actual abilities and to match those abilities with actual program requirements which would provide meaningful work experience to the handicapped person. (footnote omitted). In its past decisions, the Commission has held that reasonable accommodation need not be limited to a particular course of action, but instead can and should involve various methods to allow the person with a handicap to work while also allowing the employer to efficiently utilize its employees. Thus, EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 704 speaks to a number of methods of providing reasonable accommodation such as, but not limited to, job restructuring, modified work schedules, acquisition of equipment, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that reassignment to another craft was an appropriate accommodation where the agency established it had a "greater job-related need" to have appellant in the clerk craft than in his desired craft.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Dahlman v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 0120073190 (2010), the Commission found that reassignment was an appropriate accommodation where the employee's preferred accommodation would have required the assignment of essential job functions to other employees. The complainant, a product safety investigator who suffered from major depression and PTSD, sought an accommodation that would excuse her from performing any investigations involving consumer deaths. Although it appears that the agency did informally accommodate the request for a period of time, ultimately a new supervisor determined that the request could be accommodated only as resources permitted. The agency subsequently determined that it needed to reassign the complainant to a compliance officer position because resource would no longer permit her to be excused from performing death investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dahlman</span>, found that the agency had provided reasonable accommodation to the complainant and that it was not required to provide the accommodation of choice, particularly where that accommodation required the reassignment of an essential job function. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dahlman</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1273"></span>Although complainant requested that these obligations be reassigned to others, and indeed, the agency complied with this request for a period of time, the agency was not required to do this. Complainant does not identify any other accommodation, other than the reassignment of essential functions, for the PSI job. Accordingly, we find the agency acted appropriately when it reassigned complainant to the Compliance Officer position, as she could not be accommodated within the PSI position.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not obligated to provide the accommodation preferred by the employee, rather "any reasonable accommodation by the agency was sufficient to satisfy its legal obligation." <span class="Italic">Gore v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01931927 (1994). The agency did not fail to provide reasonable accommodation when it denied the complainant's request for advance sick leave and transfer while receiving treatment for alcoholism where it granted him leave without pay and rescinded its removal while he sought treatment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Santos v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120110986 (2012) (providing amplified handset instead of requested headset was an effective accommodation for hearing-impaired employee, especially where employee never informed agency that handset was not adequate); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983820 (2001) (finding no failure to accommodate where agency provided complainant with duties within his medical restrictions, but would not grant preferred accommodation of transfer).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120064126 (2007), the complainant suffered from bronchial asthma. As a result, she could not be exposed to respiratory irritants, such as paint fumes, glues, cigarette smoke, mold, dust, insecticides or perfumes.</p>
<p class="noindent">In December 2000, the complainant requested a reasonable accommodation in the form of being excused from so-called "master docket duties" of her case assistant job. Those duties included opening boxes of files as part of the intake process. Ultimately, the supervisor told the complainant that he would open boxes when she was required to perform master docket duties, and other employees volunteered to perform master docket duties, so she did not have to perform that all.</p>
<p class="noindent">In October 2002, the agency began office renovations and the complainant requested an accommodation of working at home during the renovations so that she would not be exposed to fumes and dust from construction materials. In making the request, she explained that she had attempted to use a face mask, but still suffered from asthma attacks. The agency denied the complainant's request to work at home and offered her the alternatives of working at another office if that could be arranged, working in another office in the same building, or taking leave without pay. Although the record was unclear on whether these options were actually presented to the complainant, the agency unilaterally chose to move her to another office in the same building--an accommodation that proved ineffective as the complainant still suffered asthma attacks.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant because the accommodation provided was not effective. It also noted that although the agency maintained that allowing the complainant to work at home was an undue hardship, there was evidence that a coworker had been allowed to work at home for an entire year.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee needs an accommodation to perform the essential functions of a position, but turns down an effective accommodation offered by the agency because it is not her preferred accommodation, this may preclude the employee from remaining a qualified individual with a disability. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Contractor v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01970386 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that appellant is a qualified person with a disability, we further find that the AJ correctly determined that the agency fulfilled its obligation to accommodate appellant by offering her several positions (UA-11 and below) with the agency. However, appellant declined the agency's accommodation offers. According to EEOC regulation, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.9 (1997) an agency cannot require an individual with a disability to accept a reasonable accommodation that she does not want. This regulation also provides that if an employee needs a reasonable accommodation to perform an essential function and she refuses to accept an effective accommodation, she may not be qualified to remain in the job. We find this regulation applicable in this case in light of the overwhelming evidence showing that appellant turned down the positions that were offered to her as an accommodation by the agency. The Commission has found that an employer is not obligated to provide the accommodation preferred by an employee rather the employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective<span class="Italic">. See</span> Notice No. 915.002 (March 1, 1999), EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>. We note that appellant offered no additional persuasive evidence in support of her claim on appeal, therefore we discern no legal basis to reverse the AJ's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dibert v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120063940 (2008), the complainant, who suffered from attention deficit disorder claimed that the agency failed to provide reasonable accommodation, in part, by refusing to provide a lower-light work environment to reduce because of an eye condition that made her extremely sensitive to light. The Commission found that the measures instituted by the agency did constitute reasonable accommodation and that the complainant was unclear on her preferred accommodation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dibert</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we determine that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that the agency reasonably accommodated complainant with respect to her mental impairments, Witnesses testified that in an attempt to provide complainant with an environment with limited distractions and less stress, the agency reassigned her to a less stressful position of equal pay and grade and assigned her to an isolated work space. With respect to complainant's light sensitivity, because there was no vacant private office space available for complainant, the agency removed all the light bulbs over complainant's work space, gave a neighboring co-worker a desk lamp so that complainant could work in dim conditions, removed a light fixture out of complainant's work area, and removed soft light bulbs from complainant's cubicle. Despite the agency's ongoing efforts to accommodate complainant, complainant maintains that she was not provided with a reasonable accommodation. However; in a letter to the agency dated July 13, 2001, complainant informed her supervisor that she "was quite happy with the soft white bulbs where the light fixture was at," which establishes that the soft white bulbs provided an effective accommodation. When the soft lighting was removed in an attempt to determine what type of lighting best suited complainant, complainant complained to her supervisor but failed to respond to the supervisor's request that she make a final choice about what type of lighting she preferred because the agency could not continue experimenting with office lighting indefinitely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rather than excusing an employee from a rotating work shift, an effective accommodation may be to provide the employee with a modified workshift that addresses both the employee's and the agency's needs. For example, in <span class="Italic">Renteria v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120071044 (2009), the complainant worked as a medical technician. Medical technicians were required to work a rotating schedule that periodically required work on a third shift. The complainant, who had a hearing impairment and also developed an eye condition that affected peripheral and night vision, sought an accommodation of being excused from third shift work so that she could drive to and from work in daylight. Instead, the agency provided her with a modified third shift from 11:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 7:45 <span class="small">P.M.</span> instead of the normal third shift from 12:15 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to 9 <span class="small">P.M.</span> The agency further gave the complainant liberal leave when she believed that weather conditions might affect her ability to drive. The Commission found that the agency had provided the complainant with reasonable accommodation since the work shift modifications were effective even though they were not the employee's preferred accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">While an agency is not required to implement the accommodation preferred by the employee, the 1991 Civil Rights Act does make it clear that an agency should consult with the employee in determining the appropriate accommodation. See "<a href="0100-2023-24-016.html#sec15-17">Good Faith Accommodation Efforts</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is justified in requesting further medical information from the complainant, even though it concedes he is a qualified individual with a disability, when the complainant asserts that the agency's offered accommodation is insufficient and that only his preferred accommodation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Young v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992198 (2002). In so holding, the Commission relied on appendix guidance to 29 CFR 1630.9, stating that when the need for accommodation is not obvious, the agency can request the employee to provide medical information on the need for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency makes its facility accessible to the complainant, there is no failure to accommodate because the complainant's access is not through the main entrance. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Hinnant v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01992572 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability, we find that the agency has provided her a reasonable accommodation. The record indicates that complainant was given viable and reasonable access to the facility in that the agency provided her with a parking space near the ramped east entrance and a scooter to make her way around. While this entrance is 700 feet further from complainant's work space, we note that she is traversing those 700 feet via scooter, and thus not exacerbating her physical condition. Complainant is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice. As a qualified individual with a disability, complainant is entitled only to an effective accommodation. There is no indication by the complainant on appeal that the ramp she was asked to use was unusable because of physical specifications, was in an area particularly difficult or dangerous to navigate, or was located in an area that was otherwise undesirable. The mere fact that it was not the front entrance is not enough to render the accommodation ineffective.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Potter v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120062498 (2007), the Commission reached a similar result where the agency offered the complainant a personalized parking space close to the building if he followed the proper procedures for requesting one. The complainant declined to follow those procedures insisting instead that he wanted better parking opportunities for all disabled persons. The Commission found that the agency had <span id="Page_1274"></span>offered the complainant an effective accommodation even if it was not his accommodation of choice.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is, however, a difference between an employee's preference and the recommendation of health care professionals. If an agency does not provide the precise accommodation recommended, then it must show that the accommodation it provided allowed the complainant to perform the essential functions of the position and it also must demonstrate that it would have been an undue hardship to provide the requested accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01945850 (1996), an agency workspace evaluation expert recommended certain ergonomic changes to the complainant's workspace. The complainant's physician concurred in the recommendations and indicated the complainant would be able to return to work without restrictions if the accommodations were provided. The agency did not provide the accommodations, but instead improvised on several of the accommodations. In finding that the agency had not reasonably accommodated the complainant, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that appellant was not able to perform the essential functions of his position with the accommodation actually provided by the agency is immaterial, because the agency did not meet the specifications set forth in the WES's recommendations. Although the AJ dismissed the discrepancies as a "variation of a few inches" in the ergonomic plan, that variation served to defeat the purpose of the accommodation, which was to enable appellant to work in a "supported and neutral position." See the discussion in the text, below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency has not met its burden to reasonably accommodate appellant's disability. Although the agency did engage in an effort to accommodate appellant, the record plainly reveals that agency officials were aware, even at the time the accommodation was attempted, that the office furnishings provided to appellant, and their placement, would not be in compliance with the recommendations of the WES, as seconded by appellant's physician. The Commission notes that appellant's physician did not state that appellant could return to work without restrictions if the agency provided him with "more or less" what the WES recommended. Further, the agency has produced no evidence to show that it would have worked an undue hardship on the agency's operations to obtain furnishings which would have enabled it to meet appellant's requirements. For example, the agency has not shown that it would have been an undue hardship for it to buy a bi-level table of the appropriate type when one could not be found within the agency, nor that it would have been an undue hardship to modify an existing table before requiring appellant to use it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did find, however, that a recommended accommodation of a specific computer was not reasonable. The Commission found no substance to the complainant's argument that the computer would result in him having to use less keystrokes and reference manuals.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reiterated its case law in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA, "</span>Requesting Reasonable Accommodation," at Question 9, noting that if two accommodations are equally effective the agency is free to implement the accommodation that is least costly. Relying upon that guidance, in <span class="Italic">Parnofiello v. Attorney General</span>, 01966451 (1999), the Commission found the agency had not failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant when it restructured his existing job rather than reassigning him to a position he contended would have been a better accommodation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Parnofiello</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the employer may also choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. Guidance at 17. The employer is not required to provide the reasonable accommodation that the individual wants<span class="Italic">. See</span> Guidance at 17-18. If more than one accommodation is effective, "the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration. However, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations." Guidance at 18, quoting 29 CFR Pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.9 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most importantly, before considering reassignment, the agency properly considered those accommodations that would enable appellant to remain in his Border Patrol Agent position. Reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and is required only after it has been determined that: (1) there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her current position, or (2) all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship. Guidance at 39. The record evidence showed that the agency already was accommodating appellant in the Border Patrol Agent position. In this regard, the former Patrol Agent in Charge testified that the reason appellant was given Employer Sanctions duties was because "the chance of meeting a hostile felon [was] low." The former Patrol Agent in Charge said he ensured that appellant was not put into a position in which he might be injured by giving him work that kept him in the office or his car. Record evidence also showed that the agency also had offered appellant the opportunity to perform "some limited duty type activities, working with Sector, completing reports, paperwork or research" and that appellant declined the offer. The Commission finds that the agency reasonably accommodated appellant's disability through job restructuring. Job restructuring is a form of reasonable accommodation. Guidance at 4, 25-26. It includes modifications such as reallocating or redistributing marGINAl job functions that an employee is unable to perform because of a disability; and altering when and/or how a function, essential or marGINAl, is performed. Guidance at 25.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in the same case, the Commission found that the agency discriminated against the complainant on the basis of his disability--a brain stem injury--in not selecting him for a subsequent vacancy for the position to which he sought reassignment.</p>
