<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-68"><span class="space">12.</span> Zero Tolerance Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Employees are obligated to follow agency policies. And, agencies are obligated to draft, promulgate, and enforce those policies in nondiscriminatory fashion. Consistent application is key. Failure in that regard could lead to allegations of discrimination and inform pretext analyses.</p>
<p class="noindent">For instance, the Commission in Lydia W. v. Postmaster General, 2021004453 (2022), found pretext where the agency failed to consistently apply a zero-tolerance drug and alcohol policy: </p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that the AJ did not err in finding that there was substantial evidence in the record to support his finding of a prima facie case of sex discrimination. The AJ found that C1, a male carrier, was a comparator who was treated more favorably. C1 was suspected of having drank alcohol prior to coming to work like Complainant. S1, rather than refer C1 to the same medical examination Complainant underwent, told him to have a mint because his breath smelled of alcohol. The AJ found that C1 credibly testified that despite admitting to S1 that he had been drinking was never taken to a medical facility for testing, examination, or evaluation, and he was never disciplined by being placed on emergency placement or issued a notice of removal. Moreover, C1 was never given an official discussion or investigative interview regarding his alcohol use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be considered “similarly situated,” a comparator employee must be similar in substantially all aspects, so that it would be expected that they would be treated in the same manner as a complainant. See Complainant v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., EEOC Appeal No. 01A60528 (July 14, 2006) (citing Complainant v. Dep’t of Treasury, EEOC Appeal No. 01A22092 (Mar. 13, 2003)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, C1 was not a valid comparator because, unlike Complainant, there was no evidence that S1 ever thought that C1 had slurred speech. According to the Agency, there is more than one reason why a person’s breath could smell of alcohol. Combined with the slurring of speech, the Agency maintained, the use of alcohol and/or intoxication was the logical conclusion. The Agency maintained that there was no evidence presented that only one factor should have warranted the same result. Also, the Agency noted, C1 admitted that based on his relationship with S1, S1 could very well have been joking when their interaction occurred. The Agency’s argument, however, ignores C1’s testimony, which was found to be credible by the AJ, that he told S1 that he had drank alcohol.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argued that a prima facie case based on sex was defeated by S1’s treatment of C2, a male CCA, about two months before the incident with Complainant. The Agency argued that C2 was similarly situated to Complainant and thus a proper comparator who destroyed her claim for disparate treatment because he had the same position as Complainant, the same supervisor, had slurred speech, and alcohol on his breath, and he was taken to the clinic and subsequently removed. The AJ, however, found that C2 was not a valid comparator because “Complainant’s conduct was plainly different than [C2’s] conduct.” We find that the record supports the AJ. As the AJ noted, “[C2] engaged in far worse conduct than Complainant including two positive BATs [0.121 for his first test and 0.124 for his second test six minutes later] many multiples higher than Complainant, test[ed] positive for controlled substances, and [had] a prior 60-day suspension,” and he was not removed by the Agency but rather “resigned prior to removal.” Complainant had a negative BAT, with a blood alcohol level that was significantly lower than C2, and was not intoxicated. The Agency focused solely on the fact that both C2 and Complainant were sent for testing but ignored the fact that C2 presented with slurred speech, the smell of alcohol, and was clearly intoxicated as evidenced by his very high BAT. Unlike the situation involving Complainant and C1, where there was only a smell of alcohol, C2’s conduct left S1 with no choice but to refer him for testing because, as the AJ found, his behavior was much worse. Even if C2 was a valid comparator, which he was not, Complainant had still established a prima facie case. Such evidence about C2 would only be relevant to defeat Complainant’s argument regarding pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the AJ did not err in finding there was evidence to support a finding of pretext. The Agency argued that Complainant was in violation of its zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. The AJ found, however, that the Notice of Removal “did not include a zero-tolerance policy in the listed authorities,” nor were there any contemporaneous record documentation that Complainant was in violation of a zero-tolerance policy. Complainant was not provided a copy of such a policy and was not informed that she had violated it. At the hearing, not one RMO was able to point to where such a policy exists. S1 claimed that a zero-tolerance policy was posted on a bulletin at every station and that he believed he received training on it. Yet, as the AJ noted, he was unable to describe it and could not identify the policy with any specificity, and he did not know when he received the training or whether the zero-tolerance policy was in a particular manual or the local LA District rules. As Complainant notes on appeal, if there were such a policy, S1 did not follow it because he did not send C1 for a medical examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also considered the Agency’s various policies for how to handle employees when they have consumed alcohol while on duty or if they are intoxicated while on duty. However, the AJ found “[t]here is no credible evidence for any of the Agency officials to have believed Complainant consumed alcohol on duty especially when her conversation with [S1] occurred within minutes of her arrival[,] [a]nd they all disclaimed concern of Complainant being intoxicated.” On appeal, Complainant notes that S1 testified that he did not “notice any exceptional diminishment of the Complainant’s physical or mental control on November 7th.” Thus, we find that the record supports the AJ’s determination that, Complainant demonstrated that the Agency’s reasons concerning a zero-tolerance policy and her fitness for duty were unworthy of credence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ further noted that while the Emergency Placement stated that Complainant was acting erratically, both S1 and A1 each testified that Complainant was not acting erratically. Moreover, although the Emergency Placement stated that Complainant was under the influence of alcohol, the AJ found that her negative BAT test results were 0.006, which was far below the level of legal intoxication and, we note, was not considered a positive test by the OHS facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2026;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency submitted a Declaration from Doctor M1, the Associate Medical Director for the Agency. M1 stated, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Postal Service’s drug and alcohol policy is zero-tolerance, meaning that no employee should have any amount of drugs or alcohol in their system while at work at the Postal Service. This is in part because of the unique circumstances that factor into how alcohol will affect a person and the fact that a large portion of the Postal Service’s workforce interacts with customers and operates vehicles or other machinery
</p>
<p class="noindent-1">M1 also stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Complainant] was in violation of the Postal Service policy regarding drugs and alcohol on November 7, 2018. Not only did she have a detectable amount of alcohol in her system when she was tested, she appeared impaired while at work. And regardless of <span id="Page_743"></span>what [Complainant’s] breath alcohol content was at the time it was taken, I can say, with a reasonable degree of scientific and medical certainty, that that number would have been higher at 7:30 A.M., the time she was scheduled to report to work, as well as at 8:30 A.M. the time she actually clocked in.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ limited his consideration of M1’s Declaration to her statement that, “I can say, with a reasonable degree of scientific and medical certainty, that that number [Complainant’s BAT] would have been higher…at 8:38 A.M.” Specifically, the AJ stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I have limited the quoted portion to the expertise for which [M1] is relevant. However, I also note that Complainant does not dispute that her BAT would have likely been higher when she clocked in than when she was tested. She is not an appropriate witness regarding Agency policy where she cites to none and does not explain any. Rather, such declaration testimony is concerning because she claims ‘no employee should have any amount of drugs or alcohol in their system while at work at the Postal Service,’ when there are clearly exceptions delineated in Agency policy, including Officer Approved Events, working meals, employee recognition event[s], employee appreciation event[s], industry conference, sales meeting[s], supplier meeting[s], etc. ROI at 247 (ELM 665.26). She is not competent to testify to any perceived level of impairment when Complainant was at work because she was not a firsthand witness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the AJ’s decision to exclude aspects of M1’s Declaration was an abuse of discretion and constituted prejudice in this matter. We disagree. Administrative Judges have broad discretion in the conduct of hearings, including discovery, and the determination of whether to admit evidence, or permit or compel the testimony of witnesses. See 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109. Upon review of the record, the Commission finds no evidence that the AJ abused his discretion in these matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ admitted only the relevant portion of M1’s declaration in which he found her credible, based on her expertise, i.e., that Complainant’s BAT would have likely been higher when she clocked in than when she was tested. The AJ excluded the other portions of her declaration regarding the existence of a zero-tolerance policy and what she perceived to have been Complainant’s level of impairment while at work, which was not based on her personal observation.</p>
<p class="noindent">On their face, zero tolerance policies for such things as workplace violence sound like a good idea. The problems with such policies, however, is in defining what constitutes workplace violence and demonstrating consistent enforcement of the policies. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123564 (2013), provides a good example.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the complainant claimed race, sex and age discrimination when the agency proposed her removal and issued a one-day suspension in response to an incident of alleged violence. The complainant, who was a 65-year-old African American male, was a housekeeping aide with 20 years of service and no prior disciplinary record, got into a dispute with a younger Caucasian female nurse. The complainant found a five-dollar bill and later asked if anyone had dropped the money. The nurse claimed that she had but, in response to the complainant's questions, could not say where she had lost the money. She then reached into his pocket to retrieve the money and instead extracted his car keys. Accounts then differ, but ultimately, the complainant took his keys from the nurse. The agency contended that its zero tolerance policy required the discipline. In finding that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> had established pretext, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The responsible management officials assert they were enforcing the Agency's "zero tolerance" for workplace violence as the reason for the proposed removal and subsequently imposed suspension for this incident. While the witness statements varied, the managers indicated they relied on those statements which said that Complainant "twisted" the nurse's arm and said he would "crush" her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the responsible management officials have proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for their actions, the burden shifts to Complainant to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that this was a pretext masking the fact that race and/or age played a role in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has met this burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is little dispute in this case concerning the facts of what occurred on May 26. The Agency's application of its "zero tolerance" policy would be legitimate, if warranted here, and consistently enforced in a non-discriminatory manner. However, the Agency does not provide any explanation for why the nurse, who was also involved in the incident, was not similarly disciplined when it is undisputed that she instigated the conflict, aggressively approached Complainant, and deliberately put her hand in Complainant's pocket and grabbed his keys. She refused to give them back to him despite his repeated requests. The record contains absolutely no evidence to support a finding that the nurse was disciplined at all for her role in the matter, much less in a similar manner. We recognize that the record shows that the female nurse worked for a different supervisor than Complainant. However, the Agency was clear that the zero tolerance policy applied to all employees. Without an explanation provided by the Agency for the differing treatment of Complainant and the nurse, we are left with the inference that the difference was the result of discriminatory factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the record provides very little support for the Agency's assertion that Complainant's behavior violated the "no tolerance" policy. First, the VA police were called and, after an investigation, found no basis to file criminal charges against either Complainant or the nurse. The record also contains absolutely no statement from the nurse herself indicating that she believed Complainant's actions amounted to "violence" towards her. Even more significant, the nurse's supervisor was present during the incident, and despite Complainant's request that she intervene, she did nothing, saying she did not want to get involved. The record also does not include any statement from this supervisor. Given the Agency's policy against workplace violence, this absence is telling. If the supervisor had been concerned that workplace violence was occurring, she would have been duty-bound under the Agency's policy to intervene.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we are not persuaded by the Agency's argument that there can be no discrimination because it disciplined a younger Caucasian male employee in an unrelated incident for placing his hands on a coworker. Evidence of this asserted comparator lacks significance to the instant case because the Agency offered no explanation for the fact that there is no evidence the Caucasian younger nurse was issued a notice of removal or disciplined in any way for her role in instigating the conflict and for her aggression, including physically touching Complainant by putting her hand in his pocket and taking his keys.</p>
