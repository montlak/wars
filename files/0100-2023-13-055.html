<h2 class="h2" id="sec4-51"><span class="space">IX.</span> COOPERATION OF COMPLAINANT</h2>
<p class="noindent">The complainant has an obligation to cooperate with the agency during the investigative stage, and failure to cooperate could result in a finding of no discrimination. The EEOC has declined to remand a case on the basis that the investigative file was incomplete where the employee was uncooperative during the investigation and had not requested a hearing. <span class="Italic">Colantuoni v. Export-Import Bank of U.S.</span>, 01831840 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC requires that a complainant receive notice and an opportunity to respond before a complaint is dismissed on the basis of failure to cooperate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(7). The agency also has the option of adjudicating the complaint on the basis of available information if that information is sufficient. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Dismissal of complaints for failure to cooperate is covered fully in Chapter 3 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-12-223.html#sec3-209">Failure to Prosecute or Cooperate</a>." However, some specific situations concerning the dismissal of complaints for failure to cooperate during the investigative process are covered below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the complainant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond prior to having a complaint dismissed for failure to cooperate, one issue that occasionally arises is whether the complainant has, in fact, received the demand for information. The Commission does not require actual receipt by the complainant, but applies the doctrine of constructive receipt to demands for additional information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993812 (1999). Under the doctrine of constructive receipt, a demand for information will be deemed received by the complainant if delivered to a family member of suitable age and discretion at the complainant's home. The doctrine of constructive receipt is discussed in more detail in Chapter 2, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-11-121.html#sec2-121">Constructive Receipt of Notice</a>," with respect to receipt of the notice of final interview. Discussed below are those situations that relate to actual cooperation or failure to cooperate with agency demands for information in the investigative stage.</p>
<p class="noindent">EEOC regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.605(d), require that when a complainant is represented by an attorney all requests and official correspondence be served upon the complainant and his or her attorney. Time frames for responding run from receipt by the attorney. As a result, an agency may not dismiss a complaint when the complainant fails to respond to a request for an affidavit where that request is not served upon the complainant's attorney. The time frame for responding in that situation does not begin to run until receipt by the attorney. <span class="Italic">See Elliott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21478 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The rule with respect to cooperation does not mean the complainant must acquiesce to whatever the investigator demands in the way of requirements. In <span class="Italic">Abintenya v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01842872 (1986), the investigator failed to include an affidavit in the investigative report on the grounds that the complainant refused to cooperate. In lieu of the affidavit, the investigator placed in the record a transcript of a tape recorded conversation between himself and the complainant. The transcript showed that the investigator objected to the complainant also recording the interview, and refused to allow the complainant to read two letters into the record that the complainant felt were relevant to his case. The transcript ended with the complainant being cut off in mid-sentence. The Commission noted that the investigative file did not include any sworn testimony from the complainant and said the failure to include an affidavit was an omission of a "crucial portion" of the investigative report "render[ing] the file one-sided and virtually useless." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The case was remanded to the agency with orders to have a different investigator obtain an affidavit from the complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Norwell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01861820 (1987) (complainant did not learn of her appointment with the investigator until two days beforehand and requested a 15-day extension to prepare for the interview; the request for the extension was reasonable where the complainant gave the investigator a prepared statement at the scheduled meeting and requested the extension to continue the interview).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Koenig v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A61461 (2006), reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint for failure to cooperate during a factfinding conference, in part, because the agency had not provided the required notice of proposed dismissal with an opportunity to respond. In reversing the agency, the Commission also found there was not failure to cooperate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant stated that she did not refuse to cooperate because she kept the November 9, 2005 date for the FFC in good faith despite having received untimely notification of the meeting changes. Complainant argues that she did not receive a copy of the letter dated October 26, 2005, regarding the FFC scheduling change. Instead, complainant contends that she was notified of the scheduling change by phone the week of October 31, 2005. On November 7, 2005, complainant contends that she was contacted by the investigator who stated that the management official (Ml) accused of the alleged discrimination against complainant would not be present at the FFC. Consequently, complainant stated that she decided to attend the FFC telephonically believing that Mi's absence would provide her with an equitable chance of defending herself. However, Ml was present at the FFC and complainant argues that despite her lack of preparation for his presence, she continued to cooperate. Additionally, complainant argues that there were technical problems with the teleconferencing system which made the conversations difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has failed to satisfy the regulatory requisites of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(7), thus complainant's actions in this case do not constitute a failure to cooperate. The agency offers no proof of complainant's receipt of the letter dated October 26, 2005, informing her of the scheduling change. Further, the record discloses that the agency failed to notify complainant of Mi's decision to attend the FFC. However, the record reveals that complainant was present at the November 9, 2005 FFC despite untimely notification of the meeting changes. Upon review of <span id="Page_326"></span>the record, the Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed complainant's claim for failure to cooperate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dvoratchek v. USPS</span>, 01872005 (1987), the agency dismissed the complaint for failure to cooperate because the employee answered the investigator's questions by submitting various documents. The Commission found the dismissal was error because the documents contained specific information that was responsive to the investigator's questions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Huddleston v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05910777 (1991), <span class="Italic">supra</span> (holding that the agency may not impose additional requirements on a complainant not mandated by regulations and then dismiss for the failure to prosecute when the complainant fails to comply).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no clear precedent in Commission decisions that requires an investigator to physically assist a complainant in drafting an affidavit. <span class="Italic">Breadze v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01910307 (1991). However, the complainant may be justified in requesting additional official time for preparation of an affidavit where such assistance is not forthcoming.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency has the information sought from the complainant in its own records, it may not dismiss the complaint due to a failure to cooperate on the part of the complainant. <span class="Italic">See Syphax v. Department of Labor</span>, 01872054 (1987). The agency has an obligation to review its own records and the investigator has an obligation to elicit information relevant to the complaint from the agency. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Luyando v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05890883 (1989) (holding that the Commission would not condone the agency's conduct in failing to cooperate with the appellant's counsel by providing him with a copy of her personnel file to assist in clarifying the complaint). The agency's cooperation with the appellant's counsel was especially important because the appellant was under strict instructions from her physician not to discuss the incidents giving rise to her complaint. The Commission noted that FPM Letter 713-21 clearly places a burden on the agency to assist a complainant in clarifying his or her complaint, if necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for the agency to dismiss a complaint on the basis that the complainant failed to cooperate where the record shows the agency repeatedly subjected him to conflicting requirements. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880284 (1988). In that case, the employee alleged he was discriminatorily denied overtime and the agency dismissed the complaint. The record established that the complainant was scheduled to work overtime on his day off, that his supervisor called him at home and told him not to come in, and subsequently, called him back and gave him the option of coming in to work overtime. The Commission found the complainant's refusal to accept the option of working that day did not constitute a failure to cooperate.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not unreasonable for a complainant to request that a complaint be held in abeyance for a period of time because of ongoing discussions with the agency that may negate the need for pursing a complaint. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 01881253 (1988). In that case, the complainant had his complaint held in abeyance for <span class="Italic">three</span> <span class="Italic">years</span> while he pursued negotiations with the agency. Upon his request to reactivate his complaint, the agency sent him back to precomplaint counseling because it had misplaced the complaint file. It then dismissed his formal complaint as untimely. The case should not be read as standing for the proposition that complainants can choose when their complaint will go forward and when it will stagnate with the agency. <span class="Italic">Butler</span> presented unusual circumstances because the complainant had followed all agency instructions. However, there are a number of good reasons, including health, as to why a complainant may request that his or her complaint be held in abeyance without displaying an uncooperative attitude.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee's right to have a representative extends to having that representative present at the investigative interview. It is not a failure to cooperate when the complainant refuses to attend the investigative interview where the record shows her representative was out on sick leave at the time of the scheduled interview. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. USPS</span>, 01873232 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">As an alternative to dismissing a complaint for failure to cooperate, the agency must issue a decision on the existing record, if that record is sufficiently developed to render a decision. 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(7). However, cooperation is a two-way street. The agency and the complainant are required to mutually cooperate in the processing of the complaint. When mutual cooperation does not occur, the predictable result is that needless appeals are filed. Many of these appeals make for interesting case law but do little to advance the interest of either the agency or the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one such case, <span class="Italic">Kline v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910866 (1991), the Commission declined to rule on whether an agency's decision to dismiss the complaint for lack of cooperation or to base an adjudication on the existing record is purely discretionary. However, the Commission did give some guidance on when the agency will be deemed to have enough information to adjudicate the case on the record as it exists. In <span class="Italic">Kline</span>, after accepting the complaint and defining the issues for investigation, the agency requested that the complainant submit an affidavit responding to specific questions. The complainant declined to file the affidavit. Instead, he wrote three letters to the agency disputing its definition of the issues. The agency declined to respond to any of these letters. Ultimately, the agency dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In remanding the complaint for further processing, the Commission distinguished its decision in <span class="Italic">Brinson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 05900193 (1990), holding that it was error for an agency to dismiss a complaint for failure to provide information where the information being sought was already provided by the complainant. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kline</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the submitted documents in the previous decision, the Commission has decided to modify the findings and Order in its previous decision, for the following reasons. The focus of the previous decision was on the question of whether the agency needed appellant's answers in order to adjudicate his complaint. (footnote omitted). This focus was a misapplication of <span class="Italic">Brinson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and as a result the decision failed to fully evaluate the complaint files submitted by the agency, and failed to take into consideration that appellant's responses and their nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Brinson</span>, in response to the agency's request for clarifying information, submitted a second more complete complaint that provided specific information. Subsequently, the agency sent her an affidavit form and specific questions, and notified her that she had fifteen days to supply the information. Appellant responded to the request by notifying the agency of her objections to the affidavit. The fact that she responded indicated to the Commission that she was at least actively pursuing her case. That fact, coupled with the fact that the appellant had previously supplied the requested information, formed the basis for the Commission's holding in <span class="Italic">Brinson</span> that appellant's action did not constitute a failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the complaint file in the instant case reveals that, unlike the file in <span class="Italic">Brinson</span>, there are not enough specifics submitted by the appellant to provide a basis for adjudication. The Counselor's Report does provide specifics, but these are not the statements of the appellant. A general rule is that a complainant's affidavit is usually necessary for an adjudication to take. <span class="Italic">Arturo C. Razz v. the United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request Number 05890177 (June 14, 1989).[*] Alternatively, an agency may rely on a sufficiently specific complaint, as in <span class="Italic">Brinson</span>, since it is a complainant's signed statement. Where a complainant submits something equivalent to an affidavit, even if it is not on a standard agency form or an established agency format, the Commission would require the agency to continue processing the complaint. <span class="Italic">Razz</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Here, where there was little specific information submitted by appellant, it is clear that the agency could not have adjudicated the complaint with the information that is in the file. The agency was warranted in requiring answers to its questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] The specifics of the Counselor's Report were viewed as enough to obviate the need for an affidavit in <span class="Italic">George Ross v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEO Request Number 05900693 (August 17, 1990). <span class="Italic">Ross</span> is distinguishable from the present case in that in <span class="Italic">Ross</span>, the response of appellant's attorney affectively ratified the contents of the Report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we do not thereby conclude that the agency acted properly in canceling appellant's complaint. Offsetting the agency's legitimate request for information is the fact that appellant responded to three of the agency's requests, objecting to the issues as defined by the agency. The measure of the propriety of canceling a complaint for failure to prosecute is whether there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the complaint. <span class="Italic">Connally v. Papachristid Shipping Limited, et al.</span>, 504 F.2d 917 (5th Cir. 1974). Appellant's responses, even though not the information requested, at least indicate that he was actively pursuing his case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brinson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Thus there is not the clear record of delay or contumacious conduct that would warrant a conclusion that he had failed to prosecute his complaint. Appellant did fail to submit the affidavit form with answers to the agency's questions, although in his March 22 response, he submitted what arguably could be construed as a sworn statement. While, as the agency asserted in its FAD, appellant's responses lack specificity, that lack may have been reasonable at the time, given the fact that the appellant insisted that the issues of his complaint were substantially different from those accepted by the agency. If appellant was nonresponsive, so was the agency. The agency did not respond to appellant's letters disputing the definition of the issues, and did not ask the appellant for more specificity in the issues as he defined them. Therefore it may have been reasonable for the appellant to assume that the agency was asking for an affidavit pertaining only to issues which he was maintaining were incorrect. At this juncture, what is needed is to eliminate the confusion that has resulted from the nonresponsiveness of both parties. The agency should have responded to appellant's several attempts to dispute the definition of the issues. The allegations in appellant's responses were in part, raised in his formal complaint. (footnote omitted). Since the Counselor's Report is silent on these allegations, the record indicates that the matters were newly raised. In accordance with EEOC Management Directive (MD) 107, Chapter 6, &#x00A7; 1.4(g), the agency should refer appellant back to the EEO Counselor for counseling on the new matters. If appellant thereafter files a formal complaint, and the agency decides to reject any of the allegations, the agency must specifically reject the allegations in a new FAD issued in accordance with EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.215.</p>
<p class="noindent">It should be clear that an agency does not discharge its responsibility prior to <span id="Page_327"></span>dismissing a complaint for failure to cooperate merely by issuing the notice required by 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(7). Even where the agency has issued such notice, the Commission will review the underlying conduct of the complainant to determine if, in fact, there has been a failure to cooperate. For more on failure to cooperate as a basis for dismissing a complaint, see Chapter 3 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-12-223.html#sec3-209">Failure to Prosecute or Cooperate</a>."</p>
