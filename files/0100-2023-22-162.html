<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-161"><span class="space">2.</span> U.S. Senate Employees</h4>
<p class="noindent">Employees of the U.S. Senate were subject to coverage under Title III of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Codified at 2 USC 1201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, the Government Employees Rights Act of 1991 provided that Senate employees would enjoy the coverage of Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA. Enforcement authority was not vested in the EEOC, however, but with the Senate Committee on Ethics, with judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. As its companion in the federal executive branch, the procedures for Senate employees under 2 USC 1201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, were equally complex:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SEC. 301. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE RIGHTS ACT OF 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;SHORT TITLE.--This title may be cited as the "Government Employee Rights Act of 1991."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;PURPOSE.--The purpose of this title is to provide procedures to protect the right of Senate and other government employees, with respect to their public employment, to be free of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;DEFINITIONS.--For purposes of this title:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;SENATE EMPLOYEE.--The term "Senate employee" or "employee" means--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;any employee whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;any employee of the Architect of the Capitol who is assigned to the Senate Restaurants or to the Superintendent of the Senate Office Buildings;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;any applicant for a position that will last 90 days or more and that is to be occupied by an individual described in subparagraph (A) or (B); or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;any individual who was formerly an employee described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and whose claim of a violation arises out of the individual's Senate employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;HEAD OF EMPLOYING OFFICE.--The term "head of employing office" means the individual who has final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, conditions or privileges of the Senate employment of an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;VIOLATION.--The term "violation" means a practice that violates section 302 of this title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SEC. 302. DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES PROHIBITED.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All personnel actions affecting employees of the Senate shall be made free from any discrimination based on--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, within the meaning of section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;age, within the meaning of section 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 USC 633a); or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;handicap or disability, within the meaning of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 791) and sections 102-104 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC 12112-14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SEC. 303. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF SENATE FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;IN GENERAL.--There is established, as an office of the Senate, the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices (referred to in this title as the "Office"), which shall--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;administer the processes set forth in sections 305 through 307;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;implement programs for the Senate to heighten awareness of employee rights in order to prevent violations from occurring.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;DIRECTOR.--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;IN GENERAL.--The Office shall be headed by a Director (referred to in this title as the "Director") who shall be appointed by the President pro tempore, upon the recommendation of the Majority Leader in consultation with the Minority Leader.
