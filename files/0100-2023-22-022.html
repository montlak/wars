<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-23"><span class="space">5.</span> Gender Identification--Bathroom Usage</h4>
<p class="noindent">Certainly one of the hot button issues surrounding transgender employees has been bathroom usage. In <span class="Italic">Lusardi v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120133395 (2015), the Commission put the issue to rest in no uncertain terms. While acknowledging the concerns of some coworkers, the Commission held, in Lusardi, that restricting the bathroom usage of a transgender employee constituted discrimination on the basis of sex, writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII states that "[a]ll personnel actions affecting [federal] employees or applicants for employment...shall be made free from any discrimination based on...sex." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). This provision is analogous to the section of Title VII governing employment discrimination in the private sector at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), (2) (making it unlawful for a covered employer to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," or to "limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee" because of sex).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a claim of disparate treatment on the basis of sex, a complainant must show the agency took an adverse employment action against the complainant because of the complainant's sex. This can be shown through either direct or indirect evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Direct evidence" is either written or verbal evidence that, on its face, demonstrates bias and is linked to an adverse action. Pom<span class="Italic">erantz v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01990534 (Sept. 13, 2002). Where there is direct evidence of discrimination, there is no need to prove a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case or facts from which an inference of discrimination can be drawn. <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston</span>, 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985). Moreover, where the trier of fact finds that there is direct evidence of discrimination, liability is established. Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, July 14, 1992, Section III; EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 604.3, "Proof of Disparate Treatment," at 6-7 (June 1, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is a transgender individual. "Transgender" is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression, or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. American Psychological Association, Answers to Your Questions about Transgender People, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression, p. 1 (2011); <span class="Italic">see also Glenn v. Brumby</span>, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011) ("A person is defined as transgender precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes"). "Gender identity" refers to a person's internal sense of being male or female (or, in some instances, both or neither); "gender expression" refers to the way a person communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice, or body characteristics. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case, Complainant identified as female and has consistently presented herself as female since at least November 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleges that the Agency subjected her to sex discrimination when it treated her differently than other employees because she is transgender. In <span class="Italic">Macy v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821 (April 20, 2012), the Commission held that discrimination against a transgender individual because that person is transgender is, by definition, discrimination "based on...sex," and such discrimination violates Title VII, absent a valid defense. We stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When an employer discriminates against someone because the person is transgender, the employer has engaged in disparate treatment "related to the sex of the victim." <span class="Italic">See Schwenk</span>, 204 F.3d [1187] at 1202. This is true regardless of whether an employer discriminates against an employee because the individual has expressed his or her gender in a non-stereotypical fashion, because the employer is uncomfortable with the fact that the person has transitioned or is in the process of transitioning from one gender to another, or because the employer simply does not like that the person is identifying as a transgender person. In each of these circumstances, the employer is making a gender-based evaluation, thus violating the Supreme Court's admonition that "an employer may not take gender into account in making an employment decision." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 244.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Macy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency acknowledges that Complainant's transgender status was the motivation for its decision to prevent Complainant from using the common women's restroom. The Deputy Program Manager testified that the restriction was imposed due to the Agency's belief that a significant number of women in the building would be "extremely uncomfortable having an individual [use the common female restroom because], despite the fact that she is conducting herself as a female, [the individual] is still basically a male, physically." Likewise, the Agency acknowledges that it restricted Complainant from the common women's restroom because of concerns about employee reaction to Complainant as a transgender individual. S1, for example, testified that management limited Complainant to the front executive restroom because it otherwise would have been a "real shocker for everyone in the workplace." This constitutes direct evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency defends its actions in part by pointing out that the Complainant agreed to use the "single shot" restroom while other employees adjusted to her transition. In this case, the "agreement" in question was a one-page memorandum from the Complainant to the management team. It outlined the reasons for Complainant's transition and a tentative list of next steps under the heading "Path Forward." The first step, starting in mid-November, was for Complainant to start dressing consistent with her gender identity. During this time, her plan said she would "use [the] single shot restroom." The next step, set to occur about a month later, was for Complainant to undergo an undefined "Surgical Procedure" and then put in a request to use the common facility. In accordance with her plan, Complainant used the single-shot restroom in the period following her change in dress. She apparently did not undergo a surgical procedure in December and did not submit a formal request to use the common facility exclusively. On two occasions, however, she found that the single-shot restroom was out-of-order or closed and decided to use the common facility. She was confronted by S2 after each time she used the common facility. He told her that she could not use those facilities until she had undergone "final surgery." Complainant asserted in response that she was "legally female" and entitled to use the women's restroom if needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case represents well the peril of conditioning access to facilities on any medical procedure. Nothing in Title VII makes any medical procedure a prerequisite for equal opportunity (for transgender individuals, or anyone else). An agency may not condition access to facilities--or to other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment--on the completion of certain medical steps that the agency itself has unilaterally determined will somehow prove the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the individual's gender identity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On this record, there is no cause to question that Complainant--who was assigned the sex of male at birth but identifies as female--is female. And certainly where, as here, a transgender female has notified her employer that she has begun living and working full-time as a woman, the agency must allow her access to the women's restrooms. This "real life experience" often is crucial to a transgender employee's transition. As OPM points out:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[C]ommencement of the real life experience [i]s often the most important stage of transition, and, for a significant number of people, the last step necessary for them to complete a healthy gender transition. As the name suggests, the real life experience is designed to allow the transgender individual to experience living full-time in the gender role to which he or she is transitioning....[0]nce [a transitioning employee] has begun living and working full-time in the gender that reflects his or her gender identity, agencies should allow access to restrooms and (if provided to other employees) locker room facilities consistent with his or her gender identity....[T]ransitioning employees should not be required to have undergone or to provide proof of any particular medical procedure (including gender reassignment surgery) in order to have access to facilities designated for use by a particular gender.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM Transgender Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies are certainly encouraged to work with transgender employees to develop plans for individual workplace transitions. For a variety of reasons, including the personal comfort of the transitioning employee, a transition plan might include a limited period of time where the employee opts to use a private facility instead of a common one. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Circumstances can change, however and an employee is never in a position to prospectively waive Title VII rights. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co</span>., 415 U.S. 36, 51 (1974) ("[W]e think it clear that there can be no prospective waiver of an employee's rights under Title VII."); <span class="Italic">see also Vigil <span id="Page_995"></span>v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960521 (June 22, 1998) ("...[an] agreement that waives prospective Title VII rights is invalid as violative of public policy.") Agencies should, as the OPM Guidance suggests, view any plan with a transitioning employee related to facility access as a "temporary compromise" and understand that the employee retains the right under Title VII to use the facility consistent with his or her gender. OPM Transgender Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency states that it would not allow Complainant to use the common female restroom because co-workers would feel uncomfortable with this approach. We recognize that certain employees may object--some vigorously--to allowing a transgender individual to use the restroom consistent with his or her gender identity. Some, like the Agency decision makers in this case, may not believe a transgender woman is truly female, and thus entitled or eligible to use a female bathroom, unless she has had gender reassignment surgery. Some co-workers may be confused or uncertain about what it means to be transgender, and/or embarrassed or even afraid to share a restroom with a transgender co-worker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But supervisory or co-worker confusion or anxiety cannot justify discriminatory terms and conditions of employment. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex whether motivated by hostility, by a desire to protect people of a certain gender, by gender stereotypes, or by the desire to accommodate other people's prejudices or discomfort. <span class="Italic">See Macy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821; <span class="Italic">see also Fernandez v. Wynn Oil Co</span>., 653 F.2d 1273, 1276-77 (9th Cir. 1981) (female employee could not lawfully be fired because employer's foreign clients would only work with males); <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, Inc</span>., 442 F.2d 385, 389 (5th Cir. 1971) (rejecting customer preference for female flight attendants as justification for discrimination against male applicants). Allowing the preferences of co-workers to determine whether sex discrimination is valid reinforces the very stereotypes and prejudices that Title VII is intended to overcome. <span class="Italic">See Diaz</span>, 442 F.2d at 389 ("While we recognize that the public's expectation of finding one sex in a particular role may cause some initial difficulty, it would be totally anomalous if we were to allow the preferences and prejudices of the customers to determine whether the sex discrimination was valid. Indeed, it was, to a large, extent, these very prejudices the Act was meant to overcome."); <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Marriott Int'l, Inc</span>., 75 F. Supp.2d 1052 (D. Ariz. 1999); <span class="Italic">cf. Cruzan v. Special Sch. Dist., No.1</span>, 294 F.3d 981 (8th Cir. 2002) (school's policy of allowing transgender women to use women's faculty restroom did not create a hostile work environment for other employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency maintains that it is unclear whether restricting Complainant from using the common restrooms is even an adverse employment action. The Commission has long held that an employee is aggrieved for purposes of Title VII if she has suffered a harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (Apr. 21, 1994). Equal access to restrooms is a significant, basic condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See e.g</span>., OSHA, Interpretation of 20 C.F.R. 1910.141 &#x00A7; (c)(1)(i): Toilet Facilities (Apr. 4, 1998) (requiring that employers provide access to toilet facilities so that all employees can use them when they need to do so). Here the Agency refused to allow the Complainant to use a restroom that other persons of her gender were freely permitted to use. That constitutes a harm or loss with respect to the terms and conditions of Complainant's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the harm to the Complainant goes beyond simply denying her access to a resource open to others. The decision to restrict Complainant to a "single shot" restroom isolated and segregated her from other persons of her gender. It perpetuated the sense that she was not worthy of equal treatment and respect. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(2) (making it unlawful to "segregate" employees in any way that deprives or tends to deprive them of equal employment opportunities); Religious Garb and Grooming in the Workplace: Rights and Responsibilities, Q. 8 and Ex. 8 (limiting employees who wear religious attire that might make customers uncomfortable to "back room" positions constitutes religious segregation and violates Title VII). The Agency's actions deprived Complainant of equal status, respect, and dignity in the workplace, and, as a result, deprived her of equal employment opportunities. In restricting her access to the restroom consistent with her gender identity, the Agency refused to recognize Complainant's very identity. Treatment of this kind by one's employer is most certainly adverse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Agency's decision to restrict Complainant's access to the common women's restroom on account of her gender identity violated Title VII. We further find that the record contains direct evidence that the decision was based on the gender identity of the Complainant. The Agency, therefore, erred when it found that Complainant was not subjected to sex-based disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia</span>, 590 US ___, Nos. 17-1618, 17-1623, 18-107 (June 2020), refused to answer the question from a policy perspective:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he employers are left to abandon their concern for expected applications and fall back to the last line of defense for all failing statutory interpretation arguments: naked policy appeals. If we were to apply the statute's plain language, they complain, any number of undesirable policy consequences would follow. <span class="Italic">Cf. post</span>, at 44-54 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Gone here is any pretense of statutory interpretation; all that's left is a suggestion we should proceed without the law's guidance to do as we think best. But that's an invitation no court should ever take up. The place to make new legislation, or address unwanted consequences of old legislation, lies in Congress. When it comes to statutory interpretation, our role is limited to applying the law's demands as faithfully as we can in the cases that come before us. As judges we possess no special expertise or authority to declare for ourselves what a self-governing people should consider just or wise. And the same judicial humility that requires us to refrain from adding to statutes requires us to refrain from diminishing them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What are these consequences anyway? The employers worry that our decision will sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination. And, under Title VII itself, they say sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes will prove unsustainable after our decision today. But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today. Under Title VII, too, we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind. The only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual "because of such individual's sex." As used in Title VII, the term "'discriminate against'" refers to "distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals." <span class="Italic">Burlington N. &#x0026; S. F. R</span>., 548 U.S., at 59. Firing employees because of a statutorily protected trait surely counts. Whether other policies and practices might or might not qualify as unlawful discrimination or find justifications under other provisions of Title VII are questions for future cases, not these.</p>
