<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-122"><span class="space">1.</span> Collective Bargaining Agreements</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency and a labor union are not precluded from including provisions in collective bargaining agreements on voluntary substitution procedures to accommodate an employee's religious practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1605.2(e)(2). Also, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Hardison</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, an undue hardship is imposed on the employer when the requested accommodation would interfere with job or shift preference guarantees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Hasan v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113745 (2013); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Joelle v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140856 (2016) (affirming a decision without a hearing where the complainant's requested accommodation to have every Saturday off would have violated the "rotational provision" of the collective bargaining agreement presenting an undue burden for the agency). However, the agency must still demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to determine if alternative accommodations exist. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912015 (1991). <span class="Italic">See</span> discussion, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, where a religious accommodation would violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, agencies are still obligated to make a good faith effort to identify alternative accommodations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01860309, (1987); <span class="Italic">Colgan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965264 (1998). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Dino V. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020003735 (2021), for instance, found that the agency made good faith efforts to accommodate the complainant's request to not work on the Sabbath where it allowed the complainant to swap shifts with other employees. The complainant was also permitted to take a leave of absence in the event he could not find someone with whom to swap shifts. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Dino V</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 1, Complainant asserted that on March 11, 2016, he received a letter from management that denied his request for a religion accommodation not to work his Sabbath (sunset Friday to sunset Saturday).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to management witnesses, under the Agency's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) bidding for schedule was based on as seniority system. Because of Complainant's seniority level (he was close to the bottom of the list), he was unable to obtain a schedule where he did not work Saturdays. As a result, Complainant submitted a request for religious accommodation in November 2015, and again in January 2016 to the Federal Security Director (FSD).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 16, 2016, the FSD issued an Agency-wide memorandum informing employees that the Agency was unable to provide scheduling-related religious accommodation in contradiction to the Agency's CBA, Article 4, Section D, requiring that the shift and annual leave bid process be based on seniority. The January 21 memorandum instead offered the following possible accommodations: (1) a voluntary schedule/shift swap, either long-term or on a particular occasion, or (2) annual leave on a first come, first serve basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 10, 2016, Complainant met with the FSD regarding his request and on March 11, 2016, his request was denied via a letter. The March 11, 2016 letter informed Complainant that the Agency could not accommodate his scheduling request, but that he could pursue a shift swap or that he could request annual leave on a first come, first serve basis. The FSD also granted Complainant a temporary adjustment for the pay period to give him time to shift swap, seek leave or make other arrangements as necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, employers are required to accommodate the religious practices of their employees unless a requested accommodation is shown to impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(b)(1). The traditional framework for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of failure to provide a religious accommodation requires an employee to demonstrate that: (1) he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief, the practice of which conflicted with their employment; (2) he informed the agency of this belief and conflict; and (3) the agency nevertheless enforced its requirement against the employee. <span class="Italic">Heller v. EBB Auto Co</span>., 8 F.3rd 1433, 1438 (9th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.R. Co</span>., 736 F.2d 1022, 1026 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of denial of religious accommodation. Complainant is a Seventh Day Adventist who observes the Sabbath which he defined as from sunset on Friday until sunset on Saturday. Complainant sought a religious accommodation beginning in November 2015. His request was denied because, under the terms of the Agency's collective bargaining agreement, he did not have sufficient seniority to have a shift with the requested time off.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once an employee establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the Agency must show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate Complainant's religious beliefs and, if such proof fails, the Agency must show that the alternative means of accommodation proffered by the employee could not be granted without imposing an undue hardship on the Agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Tiano v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc</span>., 139 F.3rd 679, 681 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Redmond v. GAF Corp</span>., 574 F.2d 897, 902(7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05890532 (Oct. 25, 1989). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2, alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has long held that where, as here, religious accommodation would violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the agency must still make a good faith effort to determine whether permissible alternatives for accommodation exist. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Department of Transportation</span>, Appeal No. 01860309, (August 10, 1987); <span class="Italic">Colgan v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965264 (June 9, 1998). In this case, we conclude that the Agency has made a good faith effort to provide Complainant with reasonable alternatives for accommodating his religious observance of the Sabbath. Agency management specifically offered Complainant the ability to swap shifts <span id="Page_1069"></span>with other employees on either a long-term or case-by-case basis. He also was offered the ability to take approved annual leave in order not to work on his Sabbath. The FSD granted Complainant a temporary adjustment to give him time to shift swap, seek leave or make other arrangements as necessary. In sum, we affirm the AJ's conclusion that the Agency made a good faith effort to provide Complainant with reasonable alternatives to accommodating his religious beliefs when granting his request to permanently change his shift would have violated the seniority terms of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union is not required to waive a collective bargaining provision related to seniority in order for an agency to grant religious accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 03940081 (1994), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Undue hardship becomes an issue only when the employer claims it as a defense to its duty to accommodate<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 69. Undue hardship may be shown when the costs of the proffered accommodation are <span id="Page_1070"></span>more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or when such accommodation would deny another employee his job shift preference or conflict with a valid collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Trans World Airlines v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 79-85 (1977). In determining undue hardship with respect to the cost of an accommodation, the Commission will determine what constitutes more than a minimal cost with due regard given to the identifiable cost in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer and the number of individuals who will need a particular accommodation<span class="Italic">. Alvarez v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921341 (June 4, 1993). In general, costs similar to the regular payment of premium wages to substitutions would constitute more than a minimal cost. However, the infrequent payment of premium wages for a substitute or the payment of premium wages while a more permanent accommodation is being sought are costs that an employer can be required to bear as a means of providing reasonable accommodation. Further, the Commission will presume that generally the payment of administrative costs necessary for providing the accommodation will not be regarded as more than minimal<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.2(e)(1). Arrangements for voluntary swaps and substitutes do not constitute an undue hardship to the extent that they do not violate a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> seniority system<span class="Italic">. Alvarez, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency stipulated that: 1) the Worldwide Church of God is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religion; 2) the Church's policy against work on the Sabbath (Saturday) constitutes a firmly held religious belief; and, 3) petitioner informed the agency of his beliefs in this regard. The agency also stipulated that petitioner was disciplined for his failure to work on the Sabbath. Consequently, the Commission finds that petitioner established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hearing testimony established that the Superintendent asked the union to make an exception to the local CBA to allow petitioner to take Saturday as a fixed day off, but that the union declined to waive the CBA's seniority provisions. Agency officials also advised petitioner that he could swap days off with another employee, work a revised schedule, or request annual leave. Petitioner, however, never followed up on these options. That is, he did not investigate what a revised schedule was or how it might work; he did not request annual leave after July 1992 because he "knew" it would be denied; and, he did not attempt to swap days off because he said that management officials never told him that he could do so for religious reasons until after he received the notice of proposed removal. With respect to this latter assertion, the MSPB AJ found petitioner's testimony to be incredible, and we find no error in that finding. Finally, record evidence showed that absolute compliance with petitioner's request, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, placing him in a position which would have guaranteed him every Saturday off, would have placed an undue hardship on the agency's operation. The Superintendent testified that giving petitioner Saturday as a fixed day off or assigning him to the "combination" route would have violated the local CBA. The Superintendent further testified that he could not allow petitioner to work on Sunday instead of Saturday because there was only 3-5 hours of work available; he would have had a carrier idle on Monday if he allowed petitioner to make up the remaining time by casing mail; and, he would have had to pay petitioner premium wage for working on Sunday. Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the agency offered appellant several accommodations for his religious practices, that the proffered accommodations were reasonable, and that granting appellant's specific request for accommodation would have created an undue hardship on the agency's operation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the agency did give the complainant accommodation options, in good faith, and he neglected to pursue them. An agency may not sustain its burden of showing undue hardship where it merely asserts that accommodation is barred by the collective bargaining agreement but investigates no other options.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Colgan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965264 (1998). The Commission held that even where religious accommodation would violate a provision of a collective bargaining agreement, the agency still must make a good faith effort at accommodation. The agency is not required to change its contractual seniority obligations, but must pursue voluntary shift changes and transfer to another facility. Where the agency offers the complainant options and the complainant fails to pursue them, the agency has satisfied its accommodation obligations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A10112 (2002), the Commission found the agency demonstrated an undue hardship where the collective bargaining agreement required some Sunday work and the agency proposed several alternatives for the complainant. In <span class="Italic">McKinney</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following facts are not in dispute: The record reveals that complainant was a Machinist at the agency's facility in Cherry Point, North Carolina, which operated 24 hours a day. Further, customer demands often necessitated overtime and weekend work. As such, machinists in complainant's shop were often required to work on Saturday and/or Sunday. The manner in which overtime was assigned was determined by the agency's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the machinist's union. The CBA required that volunteers be sought before overtime was required of an employee. If not enough volunteers come forward, then overtime is assigned according to who had the least amount of overtime logged for the month. On February 20 and 27, 2000, complainant was required to work Sunday overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, employers are required to accommodate the religious practices of their employees unless a requested accommodation is shown to impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. 1605.2(b)(1) (citing <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,</span> 432 U.S. 63, 74 (1977). The traditional framework for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on religious accommodation requires complainant to demonstrate that: (1) he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief, the practice of which conflicted with his employment, (2) he informed the agency of this belief and conflict, and (3) the agency nevertheless enforced its requirement against him<span class="Italic">. Baum v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A05985 (March 21, 2002); <span class="Italic">Heller v. EBB Auto Co.,</span> 8 F.3d 1433, 1438 (9th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.R. Co.,</span> 736 F.2d 1022, 1026 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"A refusal to accommodate is justified only when an employer...can demonstrate that an undue hardship would in fact result from...[an] accommodation." 29 C.F.R. 1605.2(c). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1605.2(a)-(e), the Commission's "Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion" (the Guidelines), alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes. Undue hardship does not become a defense until the employer claims it as a defense to its duty to accommodate<span class="Italic">. Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook,</span> 479 U.S. 60, 68-69 (1986). In order to show undue hardship, an employer must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 74.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Herein, the agency made several efforts to accommodate complainant's religious beliefs. Specifically, the agency suggested to complainant that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;he begin his Sunday work schedule at 1 <span class="small">P.M.</span> so that he could attend morning worship services;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;he work his normal schedule so that he could attend evening worship services;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;he work a split shift on Sunday, allowing him to attend both morning and evening worship services;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;he work Saturday in lieu of Sunday overtime when possible;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;move to another machinist shop within his branch that logged significantly less Sunday hours; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;both move to another shop within his branch and, when necessary, work Saturday overtime hours in lieu of Sunday when possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency could not, however, grant complainant permanent exemption from being required to work overtime on Sundays, which is what complainant is ultimately seeking. To grant such a permanent exemption would violate the seniority procedures of a valid collective bargaining agreement (CBA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The CBA in place during the relevant time states at Article 9, Section 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Employer agrees to distribute overtime equitably among all employees with [the]...shop as far as the character of work will permit.... Consistent with the above, every reasonable effort will be made to assign overtime to the employee with the least accumulated overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant refused all of the suggested accommodations, requesting instead that he be transferred to a shop outside of his branch. The agency refused to transfer complainant to a shop outside of his branch, stating that such a transfer would pose an undue burden to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant is not afforded an absolute right of accommodation. As stated previously, under Title VII, employers are required to accommodate the religious practices of their employees unless a requested accommodation is shown to impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j); 29 C.F.R. 1605.2(b)(1) (Emphasis added). "Undue hardship may be shown where the costs of the proffered accommodation are more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or where such accommodation would deny another employee his job shift preference or conflict with a valid collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Hardison, 432 U.S. at 79-85; 29 C.F.R. 1605.2(e)." <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A01092 (June 29, 2001). The law is therefore clear: an employer meets its burden of demonstrating undue hardship where a requested accommodation is shown to be in violation of seniority procedures under a valid CBA. Hardison, 432 U.S. at 77-85. The agency herein has demonstrated that such a violation would occur if complainant was provided a permanent exemption from Sunday work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the contention that the agency has not met its burden because it did not seek to transfer complainant to another shop, we are unpersuaded. Based on the facts of this matter, the AJ erred in finding that the agency's failure to offer complainant a transfer constituted discrimination under Title VII. Here, the agency did consider a lateral transfer of complainant. The transfer, however, was found to be ineffectual because 1) no matter what shop complainant was transferred to, he would not be granted a permanent exemption to Sunday work as the CBA controlled in all shops; 2) the branch complainant was in was understaffed, making his departure a hardship on the branch; and 3) there were no vacancies in other shops in other branches. As the agency correctly stated in its appeal brief, it is not required to displace incumbent employees nor is it required to create new positions to accommodate complainant's request<span class="Italic">. See Stith v. Dalton,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940847 (February 15, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gaytko v. International Broadcasting Bureau</span>, 01A03297 (2002), holding that the agency demonstrated undue hardship where the complainant did not have enough seniority under the collective bargaining agreement for a shift transfer and the agency offered other options which the complainant refused to pursue. The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Israel v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120070247 (2009), where it found that the agency had demonstrated undue hardship where the complainant's request for all Saturdays off would have violated the national agreement, subjected the agency to multiple grievances, and the agency offered alternatives such as voluntary shift swaps, use of annual leave, and the right to seek a different position that would permit Saturdays off. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Baum v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A05985 (2002) (agency failed to accommodate by granting request of employee to participate in overtime on weekdays instead of weekends where collective bargaining agreement did not, on its face, prohibit such an accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120091077 (2009), the Commission determined that the agency failed to demonstrate undue hardship where it asserted that leave for Good Friday was granted in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Villanueva</span> was a contact representative for the Internal Revenue Service who requested annual leave to observe religious services on Good Friday. There was no dispute that the complainant was an active member of a Christian church and routinely attended Good Friday services. Because Good Friday fell close to the deadline for tax returns, he first-line supervisor denied her request. A request for the second-line supervisor to review the denial was rejected the day before Good Friday. The second-line supervisor did offer to make a "special accommodation" which is not fully described in the record so that the complainant could attend services. However, the complainant said there was insufficient time to make the alternative work. She subsequently did not report for work on Good Friday and was declared AWOL.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Villaneuva</span> asserted that it could grant only a limited number of requests for leave on Good Friday and that it determined who could be granted leave in accordance with a provision of the collective bargaining agreement. Largely based on seniority, the complainant was denied leave in favor of other employees. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Villaneuva</span>, found that the agency had not demonstrated it would have been an undue hardship to accommodate the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate complainant's religious beliefs and, if such proof fails, The agency must show that the alternative means of accommodation proffered by complainant could not be granted without imposing an undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Tiano v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc</span>., 139 F.3d 679, 681 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Redmond v. GAF Corporation,</span> 574 F.2d 897, 902 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Cardona v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890532 (October 25, 1989). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(a)-(e), the Commission's "Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion" (the Guidelines), alternatives for accommodating an employee's religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, and lateral transfers and job changes. Undue hardship does not become a defense until the employer claims it as a defense to its duty to accommodate. <span class="Italic">Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook</span>, 479 U.S. 60, 68-69 (1986). In order to show undue hardship, an employer must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 74 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we do not find that the agency made a good faith effort to accommodate complainant's religion. Management did not notify complainant that she could not use annual leave to take Good Friday off until the day preceding Good Friday. Moreover, it was not until that time, late Thursday, that the manager suggested an alternative accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence that the agency attempted to obtain voluntary substitutes or swaps, which complainant herself had suggested. Complainant stated that the agency should have solicited voluntary staffing from an alternative call center. The Commission finds that the AJ erred in finding that this process, of utilizing another call center, was inapplicable to requests for religious accommodations. Additionally, we are unpersuaded by the agency's assertion that because more employees request leave on Good Friday than can be accommodated at complainant's facility, voluntary shift swapping would be "futile." It is unclear what portion of the leave requests for April 6, 2007 were requests for religious accommodation, We do not find that an attempt to obtain volunteers would have created an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that although the agency argues that business necessity required that management deny complainant's request for leave on Good Friday, actual events illustrate that this was not true. Complainant chose not to report for work on Good Friday, and was consequently charged with AWOL. No attempt has been made by the agency to show how it was harmed by her one-day absence on April 6, 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency asserts that it properly followed its procedures (i.e. the C.B.A.), the Commission finds that the agency's actions violated the requirements under Title VII to accommodate the religious practices of their employees unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Samuelson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112777 (2013), the Commission reversed summary judgment where the agency asserted that the collective bargaining agreement prevented it from accommodating the complainant. The Commission found there was a genuine issue of material fact based on the complainant's assertion that the agency had previously accommodated his leave requests.</p>
