<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-49"><span class="space">E.</span> AGENCY'S BURDEN</h3>
<p class="noindent">As in other employment actions involving discrimination, the agency bears only the burden of producing evidence that it made the selection for a legitimate reason. The agency must provide a "specific, clear, and individualized explanation for it selection decision." <span class="Italic">Lenard H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019001566 (2020); <span class="Italic">Joannie V. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 2019004947 (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">The evidence must support the official's decision not to select the complainant for the position. In the absence of such evidence, the Commission may infer discrimination. The agency's failure to present supporting evidence and the Commission's finding that the complainant's qualifications were demonstrably superior to the selectee led to a finding of pretext in <span class="Italic">Joannie V. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 2019004947 (2020). Of importance to the Commission was the deciding official's failure to explain how the interviews, resumes, and experience of the candidates led her to choose the selectee. Reversing the agency's finding of no discrimination, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Joannie V.</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting Complainant for the Budget Analyst GS-12/13 position was that the selectee, C1, was more qualified for the position. As selecting official, S1 testified that she based her decision on the candidates' resumes, interview responses, and relevant experience. S1 also said she relied on her impressions of both Complainant and C1's "personal attributes" based on her experience as their supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a non-selection case, pretext may be demonstrated by a showing that complainant's qualifications are observably superior to those of the selectee. <span class="Italic">See Shapiro v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960403 (Dec. 6, 1996) <span class="Italic">citing Bauer v. Bailor</span>, 647 F.2d 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of Education</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970561 (Aug. 6, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we are not clear from the record, and S1 does not explain, how the interview helped her conclude that C1 was more qualified for the Budget Analyst GS-12/13 position than Complainant. The interview notes provided by S1 and AO show that Complainant and C1 conveyed enthusiasm for the opportunities provided by the Budget Analyst, GS-12/13 position. However, Complainant's responses to each question, according to the notes, were far more detailed than those of C1 and C2 and appear to demonstrate a depth of familiarity with the Budget Division's role within the Agency, its processes, and the nature of the Budget Analyst GS-12/13 position, that is not evident in the S1 and AO's interview notes for C1 and C2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, S1's notes for Question 2, which asked about the budget formulation process and various cycles of budget submission, summarize C1's response as "doesn't do too much in the formulation process. Enters into [database]." S1 summarized Complainant's response as: "we send president's budget in February. Departmental submission in June. We take [illegible] into consideration, work with program offices to develop narratives and cost increases and decreases. Senior officials make changes, next it goes to OMB. Get pass back appeal, final submissions to appropriation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, during the investigation S1 did not identify how C1's resume helped her conclude that C1 was more qualified for the Budget Analyst GS-12/13 position than Complainant. Complainant's resume reflects that she worked for the Agency since March 1989, and as a Budget Analyst, GS-12, in the OSHA Budget Office since 2002. C1's resume indicates that she worked for the Department of Labor since 2006, and had worked as a Program Analyst, GS-11, in the OSHA Budget Office since 2014. C1 earned an associate degree in General Studies in 2014, Complainant earned an accounting certification in 2012.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to relevant experience, in her affidavit testimony, S1 acknowledged that Complainant was, as a GS-12 Budget Analyst, already performing the duties described in the Vacancy Announcement for the GS-12/13 Budget Analyst. S1 also testified that C1's duties, as a GS-11, "focused primarily on tracking agency staffing and onboard statistics, preparing reports for senior management, and responding to requests for related data from OMB, members of Congress and their staff, and the press." S1 also acknowledged that C1 (unlike Complainant) "did not assist with the development of the Agency's spend plan but on an as needed basis assisted with entering the data into the Departmental E-Business Suite."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 explains her choice by stating that that Complainant's "work product was not as reliable, and her communication skills were not as developed for her grade." However, this explanation seems to contradict her own statements in Complainant's FY 2017 PA. With respect to work product, S1 awarded Complainant a score of "exceeds" (the highest possible rating) for Elements 2 and 3. Element 2 required Complainant to, among other things, compile Spend Plan data, then enter it into the DOL Electronic Business Suite to submit allocations and allotments for Departmental review. Element 3 required her to provide technical direction, assistance, and review of the development of approved budgets by Regional and National Office Directorates [and] analyze spending trends and forecasts to ensure spending is in line with budget." To earn a "meets" rating (let alone "exceed") for either Element, Complainant's work had to "meet prescribed deadlines, and [be] substantially error free," i.e. "reliable."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for communication skills, S1 also scored Complainant "exceeds" for "Element 5," which required her to "develop and maintain positive organizational relationships with financial management staff and program contacts, providing technical assistance to agency staff, departmental staff and members of the public on matters of financial management." In the "narrative" section, S1 states, among other things, that Complainant "is very attentive to her customers' needs and ensures <span id="Page_1583"></span>that she provides a high quality of customer service to respond to their budget inquiries."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 also identifies areas of communication such as Regional and National Offices and other offices and with her peers in the Budget Office. Complainant also submitted extensive email evidence of her successfully collaborating with coworkers, with no indication of underdeveloped communication skills.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not include C1's FY 2017 PA, however, S1 testified, "since I have been her supervisor, [C1], a GS-11, has demonstrated initiative and innovation in her work on complex projects, and has also demonstrated the potential to work above her grade level. For example, she worked on congressional requests and FOIA requests for agency staffing data for which she provided detailed analysis and verification of agency onboard counts. I gave her a highly effective rating for FY 2017, and gave her an outstanding rating for her work as a GS-11. She works independently, provides final products that are reliable and require little revision, is resourceful and able to solve problems, and exhibits effective communication skills. [C1] worked with senior management from the Directorate of Administrative Programs and representatives from OSHA's Regional Offices on a new SharePoint website and database to track OSHA hiring activities. She gathered data from around the agency and beta tested the new sites with agency focus groups."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's duties, provided in her resume, and her FY 2017 PA ratings, indicate that she too has the ability to problem solve and work independently on complex projects, exhibits effective communication skills, and works extensively with databases. Complainant points out that one of S1's few concrete examples of C1's work, "a new SharePoint website and database to track OSHA hiring activities" is not equivalent to the type of data gathering and reporting required of a Budget Analyst, GS-12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find, in light of the record as a whole, that this is insufficient evidence to support the Agency's proffered explanation for not selecting Complainant for the Budget Analyst, GS-12/13 position. Complainant has shown her qualifications to be demonstrably superior to those of the selectee, and therefore has successfully established that the Agency's articulated reason for her nonselection is pretext for discrimination based on age. <span class="Italic">See Chianti v. Social Sec. Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080031 (Jan. 19, 2011) (finding the Agency's articulated reasons for not selecting the complainant for a Bilingual Claims Representative were pretext for age discrimination because the management official's testimony about the complainant's work backlog was not credible, and the selecting official added criteria to screen the Complainant out despite his demonstrably superior qualifications).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternately, we find the Agency failed to meet its burden of production, as the record is devoid of evidence to support S1's characterization of Complainant's work and communication deficiencies. <span class="Italic">See Woodard v. Dep't of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970288 (February 1, 2000), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A00416 (June 5, 2000) (finding the reasons given by the Agency for not selecting the complainant were neither specific, clear, nor individualized. As a result, the explanation was insufficient to give complainant a meaningful opportunity to challenge).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission ordered the agency to retroactively place the complainant in the at-issue position, award back pay, and provide in-person training for and consider discipline action against the selecting official.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lenard H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019001566 (2020), the Commission found that the agency's investigation was inadequate where it contained a copy of the complainant's application, the interview scores without notes and a list of the other candidate's scores. Finding that the complainant established age discrimination, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lenard H</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The panelists and SO explain that Complainant was not selected because SE and one other applicant received higher interview scores than he did. The Agency's investigation included a copy of Complainant's application, the interview scores (but not the notes) from Complainant's interview, and the list of the other candidates with their scores. This was the extent of the Agency's reason for Complainant's non-selection and its supporting documentation provided to the Commission with respect to the Detective position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence presented by the Agency is not sufficient to provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation as to why Complainant was not selected for the position for which he was deemed qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency explained the general mechanics of the selection process but failed to provide an individualized explanation for Complainant's specific situation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Koudry v. Dep't of Educ</span>., Request No. 0520100196 (Apr. 13, 2010) (discrimination found where agency merely explained the mechanics of selection process, provided list of candidates deemed best qualified, and summarized applications of selectee and complainant, but failed to provide statements from selecting officials explaining how complainant's qualifications were evaluated compared to selectee's qualifications). The record simply does not indicate how the Agency determined which candidate was selected. Therefore, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to overcome Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination, and Complainant prevails without having to prove pretext. <span class="Italic">Chhe v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Request No. 0720090008 (Aug. 6, 2010) (the consequence of an agency's failure to meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that the complainant, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to make any demonstration of pretext), <span class="Italic">request for recon. den</span>. EEOC Request No. 0520100584 (Jan. 27, 2011). Accordingly, we find that Complainant has established that he was subjected to age discrimination when he was not selected for the Detective position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency does not meet this burden of production when it fails to show the selectee met the minimum qualifications for the position. <span class="Italic">Carraway v. USPS</span>, 01832760 (1985). If there is a pending EEO complaint related to a nonselection and the selecting official decides to leave the agency before the complaint concludes, the agency should at least get an affidavit from the selecting official justifying the selectee. Otherwise, the agency risks having no defense, i.e., a legitimate explanation for the selection. That was the case in <span class="Italic">William G. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120160837 (2018), where, prior to the leaving the agency, the selecting official executed an unsworn statement concerning the selection. An unsworn statement, according to the Commission in <span class="Italic">William G</span>., did not satisfy the agency's burden, leaving the agency with no defense and finding of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find significant that the record contains no sworn affidavit from the Selecting Official or from any other Agency official with actual participation in, or knowledge of, the selection decision. As such, the Agency has failed to set forth a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the selection to rebut the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination by Complainant. We therefore conclude that Complainant has prevailed in establishing that he was discriminated against based on his sex and/or age when he was not selected for the Supervisory Information Technician Specialist position, GS-13/2210, advertised under Vacancy Announcement Number DLAJ6-15-1268191-MP.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the appellant demonstrates that discrimination was a factor in the promotion selection process, the agency bears the burden of proving, through clear and convincing evidence, that the appellant would not have been promoted even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Mayson v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01840057 (1984). The fact that the agency destroyed the promotion file pursuant to its record destruction policy does not relieve the agency of this burden.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, the employer has the discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates. The agency has even more discretion when filling management level or specialized positions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Browning v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01990290 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">A common error for agencies in selection and promotion cases is to simply state that the selectee was the best qualified candidate without adequately explaining the basis for the selection. Such explanations do not meet the agency's burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. An example is provided by <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120083270 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the selectees for the GS-12/13 positions (White) were outside of complainant's protected class. We therefore find that complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for complainant's nonselection. The record does not contain the rating sheets that were, according to agency officials, completed by the interview panel in its evaluation of the candidates. Although the relevant officials explained that the selectees were chosen based on the fact that their skills and qualifications fit the agency's needs, this explanation offers little in the way of specifics. We find that the agency failed to set forth, with sufficient clarity, reasons for complainant's nonselection such that complainant has been given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that the agency's reason was pretextual. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990); <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, complainant appears to possess similar qualifications and experience as the other selectees. The agency's explanation for choosing these selectees rather than complainant is not sufficiently detailed to provide complainant the opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons were a pretext for discrimination where complainant possesses at least the same qualifications. The record contains no elaboration of how the selectees demonstrated greater proficiency than complainant with regard to their communication skills, ability to analyze data, and ability to resolve complex insurance problems. The record reveals that complainant was a staff accountant for eleven years with the agency. Complainant stated in his application that he analyzed data, led financial reviews, reviewed the work of others, and communicated with a variety of private and governmental entities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of complainant's qualifications and the agency's failure to provide <span id="Page_1584"></span>a sufficient articulation of its reasons for not selecting complainant for the position in question, we find that the agency failed to overcome complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination. Therefore, the Commission finds that complainant has established his claim of race discrimination when he was not selected for the GS-12/13 Risk Management Specialist position. Due to our finding of race discrimination, we need not make a finding concerning whether complainant was discriminated against in reprisal for his prior EEO activity since any finding regarding discrimination based on reprisal would not affect the final remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency must provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for the complainant's nonselection, as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Elliot J. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120161848 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency failed to meet its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Complainant's non-selection. Specifically, we find that the SO failed to provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for Complainant's non-selection for the position at issue. As noted above, the SO only explained that she chose the three selectees because she felt they were the most highly qualified candidates and would be the most effective team leaders based on their "qualifications, leadership abilities, and interpersonal skills." The SO further simply stated that she did not feel that Complainant was the most highly qualified candidate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the SO's affidavit testimony is not sufficiently particularized or specific to permit Complainant to mount an evidentiary challenge to any of the explanations offered by her for Complainant's non-selection. The SO's affidavit puts forth no objective facts to support her vague, generalized conclusions that the selectees were more qualified because of their leadership qualities or interpersonal skills. For instance, the SO's affidavit provided no specific examples of how or why S1, S2, and S3, were better qualified than Complainant based on their application and/or interview. The SO also provided no examples of why she believed S1, S2, and/or S3 presented superior leadership qualities or interpersonal skills than Complainant. We note that the SO contends that the selectees possessed superior qualifications even though Complainant was ranked higher and received a higher score from the selection panel than two of the three selectees. The SO also stated that Complainant's "nonselection was not the result of a lack of knowledge, experience, education, and/or specialized knowledge," but she simply found the selectees to be superior. The SO however does not describe why she believed the selectees to be superior or provide any evidence to support such a conclusion. Given the lack of specific details, we find the Agency's explanations are insufficient to afford Complainant a meaningful opportunity to prove the explanations to be untrue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Agency failed to articulate a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for Complainant's non-selection, and consequently, Complainant was denied a fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Dep't. of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520070124 (Nov. 14, 2011); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't. of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A32050 (Jan. 7, 2005), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den'd,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A50685 (Apr. 26, 2005); <span class="Italic">Young v. Dep't. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940517 (Oct. 13, 1995). Thus, the Agency failed to rebut the inference of discrimination, which was created when Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race, national origin, sex, and age discrimination, by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Therefore, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant based on his race, national origin, sex, and age when it did not select him for the position of Supervisory Social Insurance Specialist, GS-14, advertised under Job Announcement No. SH-1072650.</p>
<p class="noindent">Asserting that a candidate was ranked low by the promotion panel and providing scoring sheets is not sufficient to establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a selection. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Devon H. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120131083 (2015), to satisfy is burden of production, the agency must explain the actual ratings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, the Agency now has the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for not selecting Complainant. The AJ found that the Agency met its burden of production. However, we find that this was legal error. The Agency stated that the selectee was chosen because he served on the National Naval Criminal Investigative Service for 13 years, was involved in all types of criminal investigations, was one of the first investigators at the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay, and served on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Additionally, the recommending official (the SAC) also testified that Complainant was ranked last among qualified candidates from the Charlotte office, and he rated Complainant among the bottom third. However, in order to meet its burden of production, the Agency must specifically explain its evaluation of Complainant's qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that we have held that an agency fails to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason when it fails to provide specific information to explain why agency officials assigned ratings or scores to a complainant. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span> (<span class="Italic">TSA</span>), EEOC Appeal No. 0520070124 (Nov. 14, 2011) (agency did not meet its burden of production for non-selection case when it merely stated that complainant was not selected because selection panel gave him lower scores than selectees, but did not explain why panel gave him lower scores); <span class="Italic">Myles v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120092511 (Feb. 10, 2011) (agency failed to meet burden of production when it merely stated that complainant was not selected because review panel ranked him lower in scoring, because this was not a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for complainant's non-selection); <span class="Italic">Clemente v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080012 (Sept. 24, 2008) (agency failed to meet burden of production when it provided description of selection process, generally stated that selectees were more qualified than complainant, and provided no record clarification of specific qualities that made selectees better qualified than complainant); <span class="Italic">Glomski v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01955157 (July 17, 1997) (agency failed to meet its burden of production because it did not provide an explanation of review committee's assignment of scores to complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency points to a document revealing that Complainant was ranked last among Charlotte candidates, However, this document does not explain the reasoning and justification for Complainant's ranking. A bare ranking is not an analysis of Complainant's qualifications. Additionally, the Agency admitted that it failed to properly maintain fall application materials and scores of the applicants for the position. We note that EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14 provides that agencies must preserve any records pertaining to selections and promotions for a period of one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action, whichever comes later. Moreover, the regulation requires that, once the EEO complaint process is initiated, agencies must retain personnel records until a final disposition of the complaint. The Agency's failure to maintain the records related to this selection is particularly disturbing given that the Commission previously has found that the recommending official in this case, the SAC, retaliated against Complainant in connection with another matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> [ ] <span class="Italic">v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080048 (Dec. 10, 2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to overcome Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, and Complainant prevails without having to prove pretext. <span class="Italic">Chhe v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Request No. 0720090008 (Aug. 6, 2010) (consequence of agency's failure to meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that complainant, having established <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to demonstrate pretext), <span class="Italic">request for recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520100584 (Jan. 27, 2011). Therefore, the AJ erred as a matter of law with respect to claim 2. Additionally, because we find that the Agency engaged in reprisal, we decline to review whether Complainant was also subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability for claim 2 because no further relief would be available to Complainant even if he were to also prevail on this basis. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120093647 (Aug. 12, 2011); <span class="Italic">Conrad v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120041275 (Dec. 20, 2006).</p>
