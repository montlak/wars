<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-3"><span class="space">A.</span> EVOLUTION OF "DISPARATE TREATMENT" THEORY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Prior to discussing the Commission's interpretations of the circumstantial evidence theory, some background will be helpful. The Commission has followed the instruction of the U.S. Supreme Court in a trilogy of Title VII cases defining the burdens of proof in circumstantial evidence cases: <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978); and <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981). Citation of these cases is frequent in Commission decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, the plaintiff, a black civil rights and union activist, was laid off as part of a general work reduction by the employer. The plaintiff then participated in several activities aimed at the employer, including a protest during which stalled cars blocked access to the employer's plant and a "lock in" during which padlocks were placed on the front door of the plant to prevent employees from leaving. After these activities, plaintiff, in response to a help wanted ad, applied for reemployment at the company and his application was rejected. The district court concluded that the plaintiff's application was rejected because of his illegal activities and not because of racial discrimination. The district court also dismissed the case for reasons not pertinent here.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the holding of the district court that the "stall in" and "lock in" were not protected activities, but vacated the decision of the court on the issue of racial discrimination and remanded the case, holding that the plaintiff should be given an opportunity to show that the employer's reasons for refusing to hire him were a "pretext" for racial discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to review the order and allocation of the burdens of proof set down in the appellate decision. In <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, the Court issued a decision that has served as the basic framework for every case involving circumstantial evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the complainant below, charges that he was denied employment "because of his involvement in civil rights activities" and "because of his race and color." Petitioner denied discrimination of any kind, asserting that its failure to re-employ respondent was based upon and justified by his participation in the unlawful conduct against it. Thus, the issue at the trial is framed by those opposing factual contentions. . . .We now address this problem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination. This may be done by showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority, (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications. In the instant case, we agree with the Court of Appeals that respondent proved a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. . . .Petitioner sought mechanics, respondent's trade, and continued to do so after respondent's rejection. Petitioner, moreover, does not dispute respondent's qualifications and acknowledges that his past work performance in petitioner's employ was "satisfactory."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden must then shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for respondent's rejection. We need not attempt in the instant case to detail every matter which fairly could be recognized as a reasonable basis for refusal to hire. Here petitioner has assigned respondent's participation in unlawful conduct as the cause for his rejection. We think that this suffices to discharge petitioner's burden of proof at this stage and to meet respondent's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's reason for rejection thus suffices to meet the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, <span id="Page_683"></span>but the inquiry must not end here. While Title VII does not, without more, compel the rehiring of respondent, neither does it permit petitioners to use respondent's conduct as a pretext for the sort of discrimination prohibited by &#x00A7; 703(a)(1). On remand, the respondent must, as the Court of Appeals recognized, be afforded a fair opportunity to show that petitioner's stated reason for respondent's rejection was in fact pretextual. Especially relevant to such a showing would be evidence that white employees involved in acts against petitioner of comparable seriousness to the "stall in" were nevertheless retained or rehired. Petitioner may justifiably refuse to rehire one who was engaged in unlawful, disruptive acts against it, but only if this criterion is applied alike to members of all races.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, on the retrial respondent must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court then had the opportunity to revisit <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> in two cases that further refined the allocation of the burdens of proof in circumstantial evidence cases. Five years later, the Court, in <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978), considered the case of three black bricklayers who sought employment in the company. Two were rejected and the third was not hired until long after he had applied. The bricklayers alleged that the company supervisor's policy of only hiring bricklayers whom he personally knew or were recommended to him discriminated against them on the bases of race and color.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a muddled decision, the district court found against the plaintiffs under both a disparate treatment and adverse impact analysis. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, finding that the plaintiffs had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and that the defendant had not sustained its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring policy. The appellate court essentially equated the establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case with an ultimate finding of discrimination and found the employer had not successfully rebutted that finding.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Furnco</span> to further clarify the guidance of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We think the Court of Appeals went awry. . .in apparently equating a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> with an ultimate finding of fact as to discriminatory refusal to hire under Title VII; the two are quite different and that difference has a direct bearing on the proper resolution of this case. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central focus of inquiry in a case such as this is always whether the employer is treating "some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.". . .The method suggested in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> for pursuing this inquiry, however, was never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as its bears on the critical question of discrimination. A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors. . . .And we are willing to presume this largely because we know from our experience that more often than not people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting. Thus, when all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer's actions, it is more likely than not the employer, whom we generally assume acts with <span class="Italic">some</span> reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration such as race.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is understood in light of the opinion in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, it is apparent that the burden which shifts to the employer is merely that of proving that he based his employment decision on a legitimate consideration, and not an illegitimate one such as race. To prove that, he need only prove that he pursued the course which would both enable him to achieve his own business goal <span class="Italic">and</span> allow him to consider the <span class="Italic">most</span> employment applications. . . .To dispel the adverse inference from a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, the employer need only "articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978), made it clear that the demonstration of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case raised only a rebuttable inference of discrimination and that the burden then shifted to the employer to show that its true reason was something other than discrimination. The question still remained regarding precisely what the employer was required to do to sustain its burden of proof. The Court addressed that question in <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent">A detailed recitation of facts in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> is not necessary. Essentially, the plaintiff alleged that her employer failed to promote her and then later terminated her on the basis of sex. The employer asserted that the decision was based on efficiency problems and that the male employees hired were better qualified than the plaintiff. The district court found for the employer on both counts. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then reversed the finding of the district court on the termination, holding the employer had not sustained its burden of proving it was motivated by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">With the question of the employer's burden of proof squarely before it, the Court in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The nature of the burden that shifts to the defendant should be understood in light of the plaintiff's ultimate and intermediate burdens. The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. . . .The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> division of intermediate evidentiary burdens serves to bring the litigants and the court expeditiously and fairly to this ultimate question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is not onerous. The plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she applied for an available position, for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case serves an important function in the litigation: it eliminates the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff's rejection. . . .Establishment of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in effect creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee. If the trier of fact believes the plaintiff's evidence, and if the employer is silent in the face of the presumption, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff because no issue of fact remains.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden that shifts to the defendant, therefore, is to rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reason. . . .It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. To accomplish this, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection. The explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the defendant. If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is rebutted, and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity. Placing this burden of production on the defendant thus serves simultaneously to meet the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by presenting a legitimate reason for the action and to frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. The sufficiency of the defendant's evidence should be evaluated by the extent to which it fulfills these functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">For many years, the analytical framework established by the trilogy of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, <span class="Italic">Furnco</span> and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> stood without question. Many, including the Commission, believed that an accurate statement of the law was that if a Title VII plaintiff discredited the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason advanced by an employer, he or she had made the required showing of pretext and was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The fact that the plaintiff retained the burden of persuasion on the issue of intentional discrimination was understood to be synonymous with a showing of pretext. However, in the late 1980s some courts began to question this assumption, focusing on the language of <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> that "plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion" on the issue of intentional discrimination. These courts began to hold that, because the burden was on the plaintiff to prove the employer acted with a discriminatory motive, merely discrediting the employer's proffered reason did not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the employer was being dishonest in order to mask prohibited discrimination. In <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993), a majority of the Supreme Court agreed. In <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the majority held "[t]he factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons, will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination. . .. But the Court of Appeals' holding that rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons compels judgment for the plaintiff disregards the fundamental principle. . .that a presumption does not shift the burden of proof, and ignores our repeated admonition that the Title VII plaintiff at all times bears 'the ultimate burden of persuasion.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever can be said of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, and indeed much has been said and written since the decision, it is clear that the method of analysis in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and its progeny is still valid. Complainants must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, agencies must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their actions, and the complainant must be given an opportunity to demonstrate that reason is pretextual. Precisely what happens when the complainant meets that latter burden is now unclear. Under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the complainant may still prevail, but such a finding is not compulsory. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> leaves open the possibility that the factfinder can conclude the employer has been <span id="Page_684"></span>dishonest about the reasons for taking an employment action but has not engaged in intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the remaining sections of this chapter that deal with circumstantial evidence, the particulars of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis are explored. Because <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> does not alter the basic analysis, only the conclusions that can be reached, it is treated in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-19-056.html#sec10-49">Pretext--Circumstantial Evidence Cases</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework has been adopted by the Commission as the basis for analyzing discrimination cases involving circumstantial evidence regardless of the basis of discrimination alleged. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Downing v. USPS</span>, 01822326 (1983). The purpose of the remainder of this section is to further acquaint the reader with this framework. The author has not chosen to include every Commission case that mentions the burdens of proof in this chapter, or even this book. Citation of those cases alone would fill several pages and serve little purpose. Each case must be evaluated according to its particular facts. To summarize each case in which the Commission found the appellant did or did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case would do little to assist the reader for two reasons. First, it is highly unlikely that any two cases present exactly the same facts. Second, such summaries would include only the most important facts and may not account for all the detailed permutations that can occur. The focus here is on assisting the reader to gain a basic understanding of how the Commission uses factual determinations to decide whether or not discrimination occurred in cases where the evidence of intent is circumstantial. When dealing with a particular type of case, the reader is advised to also consult that section of the Guide for any specific guidance. Examples cited in this chapter were chosen for illustrative purposes, to help explain some general points.</p>
<p class="noindent">Much of what follows will look familiar to the reader. That is because it is. The Commission has had ample opportunity to reiterate the findings of the Supreme Court, in its trilogy of discrimination cases, on the burdens of proof in disparate treatment complaints. Occasionally, it has even had the opportunity to clarify further those cases.</p>
