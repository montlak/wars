<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-59"><span class="space">1.</span> Environment Hostile Toward Females</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission suggested on numerous occasions that a male employee may be aggrieved by a work environment that is hostile toward females, in <span class="Italic">Andrasko v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01951304 (1995), it found that the male complainant had not stated a claim for relief. In upholding dismissal of the complaint in <span class="Italic">Andrasko</span>, the Commission seemed to hopelessly confuse several principles. In the end, it is hard to determine what the case really means. The Commission found that the complainant was not aggrieved because he had not demonstrated that any alleged harassment was severe or pervasive enough to rise to the level of a hostile environment. The Commission started its analysis in the case by discussing the fact that the complainant had not alleged that he was harmed directly, but only that he was harmed by the agency's disparate treatment of others. However, the analysis then moves on to discuss the substantive analysis of the elements of a hostile environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Properly analyzed, it may well be that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Andrasko</span> failed to allege sufficient facts which, if proved, would demonstrate the existence of a hostile environment. However, the Commission has only further obscured its position in the case by making a distinction between the male complainant and the females alleged to be the victims of discrimination. If the Commission is suggesting that a male alleging he is harmed by a hostile environment toward females must do more, at the complaint stage, than allege a hostile environment, it should say so explicitly. What the Commission did say in <span class="Italic">Andrasko</span> follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant filed an appeal on December 2, 1994 with this Commission from the November 7, 1994 final agency decision (FAD) dismissing his complaint which alleged that the agency violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. Appellant filed a complaint on September 23, 1994, alleging that he was discriminated against on the basis of sex (appellant checked the box for "female") when the agency did not act on his allegations that female employees were being harassed, which allegedly created a hostile work environment for them "and for anyone who would uphold fair treatment [sic] of all employees." In its FAD, the agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency shall accept a complaint from any aggrieved employee who believes that he or she has been discriminated against by that agency because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disabling condition. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103; &#x00A7; 1614.106(a). The Commission has held that while the regulations do not define the term "aggrieved employee," the United States Supreme Court has interpreted it to mean an employee who suffers a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (Apr. 21, 1994) (<span class="Italic">citing Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</span>, 409 U.S. 205 (1972)). "To state a claim under our regulations, an employee must allege and show an injury in fact." <span class="Italic">Id. (citing Hackett v. McGuire Bros.</span>, 445 F.2d 447 (3d Cir. 1971)). "Specifically, an employee must allege and show a 'direct, personal deprivation at the hands of the employer,' that is, a present and unresolved harm or loss affecting a term, condition or privilege of his/her employment."<span class="Italic"> Id. (citing Hammonds v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900863 (Oct. 31, 1990); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900367 (June 2, 1990)). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a) provides that an agency shall dismiss a complaint that fails to state a claim under &#x00A7; 1614.103.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant's complaint fails to state a claim and that, accordingly, it was properly dismissed by the agency. Appellant has failed to show how any agency action adversely affected a term, condition, or privilege of his employment, since the gravamen of his complaint concerns the agency's alleged failure to prevent disparate treatment of other employees. Although appellant argues that this alleged discrimination against women has created a hostile environment for "anyone who would insist on fair treatment for women," appellant has failed to show that his work place was "permeated with discriminatory behavior that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a discriminatorily hostile or abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Dennis James v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940327 (September 20, 1994) (<span class="Italic">citing Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Commission stated in <span class="Italic">James, supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"This standard requires an objectively hostile or abusive environment, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, as well as the victim's subjective perception that the environment is abusive. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 114 S. Ct. 367, 371 (1993). Moreover, we note that, unless the conduct is very severe, a single incident or group of isolated incidents will not be regarded as discriminatory harassment. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, 684 F. 2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that appellant has not alleged sufficient facts to constitute a discriminatory working environment. In making this finding, <span class="Italic">we particularly reiterate the fact that appellant has not alleged that the agency took action against him personally concerning a term, condition, or benefit of his employment.</span> Therefore, the agency's decision dismissing the complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis added.) <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Pieralisi v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01964426 (1998) (complaint that employee is aggrieved by harassment of coworkers does not state a claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the muddled decision, it is unclear whether a claim from a male employee that he is aggrieved by an environment that is sexually hostile toward women would be evaluated from the view of the male complainant or that of the females being harassed.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting, however, that the EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 615.3(a)(3), clearly states that "[t]he harassment of [ ] female employees may also create an offensive work environment for [ ] other male employees."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Childress v. City of Richmond</span>, 120 F.3d 476 (4th Cir. 1997), the court found that a complaint by white police officers that they were subjected to an environment hostile to blacks and females stated a claim for relief. Although the <span class="Italic">Childress</span> case addresses harassment based on race as well as gender, the principles applied are the same. Indicating the problem was one of whether the white officers had standing to bring such a claim, the court in <span class="Italic">Childress</span>, 120 F.3d at 480-81, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The problem is standing. Even if we assume, as we do at this point, that the City has discriminated against its black and female officers in the "terms, conditions, privileges" of their employment, we need to determine whether the plaintiffs are "persons aggrieved" and, if so, whether they have suffered an injury that would entitle them to bring this action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of its enforcement scheme, Congress conferred a private right of action on "the person claiming to be aggrieved...by the alleged unlawful employment practice." 42 USCA &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(1) (West 1994). Because the purposes and relevant language in Title VII and Title VIII are so similar, we believe we should begin by examining the Court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</span>, 409 U.S. 205, 93 S. Ct. 364, 34 L. Ed.2d 415 (1972), to determine whether the Supreme Court's recognition of associational rights under Title VIII militates in favor of conferring a comparable discriminatory-environment cause of action on men to complain about discrimination directed at women, or on white persons to complain of similar treatment of blacks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>, white tenants sued the owners of their apartment complex under Title VIII for the owners' alleged discrimination in preventing blacks from renting units in the same complex. The injury claimed was that of "the loss of important benefits from interracial associations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 210, 93 S. Ct. at 367. The Court held that the injury alleged brought them within the broad ambit of "person[s] aggrieved," as that term was defined in &#x00A7; 810(a) of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968: "Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice." In so holding, the Court espoused the view of an appeals court that the phrase "by a person claiming to be aggrieved," as used in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (the same statute involved in the officers' suit), "showed 'a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution.'" <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>, 409 U.S. at 209, 93 S. Ct. at 367 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc.</span>, 445 F.2d 442, 446 (3d Cir. 1971)). <span class="Italic">See also Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Marketing Corp.</span>, 28 F.3d 1268, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (Title VII is the type of statute that "confer[s] a cause of action upon everyone who meets the Article III requirements--that is, anyone 'genuinely injured by conduct that violates someone's...rights' under the statute.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood</span>, 441 U.S. 91, 103 n.9, 99 S. Ct. 1601, 1609, 60 L. Ed.2d 66 (1979)). We now take this construction of the term "person aggrieved," expressly applied by the Supreme Court to Title VIII cases and implicitly approved for Title VII cases, and apply it to the officers' case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Trafficante's</span> construction of the term "person aggrieved" and the extension of Article III standing to the victims of indirect discrimination has been adopted by every court of appeals that has considered the issue of a white person's standing to sue under Title VII for associational or hostile environment claims flowing from discriminatory conduct directed at black persons. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Hannon</span>, 675 F.2d 846, 848-50 (7th Cir. 1982) (exclusion of blacks from school principal positions); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Mississippi College</span>, 626 F.2d 477, 481-83 (5th Cir. 1980) (failure to recruit and hire black faculty members); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Bailey Co., Inc.</span>, 563 F.2d 439, 452-54 (6th Cir. 1977) (failure to recruit and hire blacks); <span class="Italic">Waters v. Heublein, Inc.</span>, 547 F.2d 466, 469-70 (9th Cir. 1976) (lower pay to blacks); <span id="Page_859"></span><span class="Italic">see also BMC Marketing</span>, 28 F.3d at 1277-78 (fair-employment advocacy organization has a cause of action under Title VII if Article III's injury-in-fact requirement is met).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reasons given for transposing <span class="Italic">Trafficante's</span> broad standing rule on Title VII cases include the similar language of the 1964 and 1968 statutes, the important enforcement role conferred on private individuals in both statutory schemes, the citation of <span class="Italic">Hackett</span> in <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>, the identity of the purpose of each statute, and the consistent interpretation by the EEOC. We subscribe to the analysis of each of these opinions, and, as additional support for our decision, we note the failure of Congress to overrule these decisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, in which fairly extensive changes to Title VII were made. <span class="Italic">See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago</span>, 441 U.S. 677, 699, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 1958, 60 L. Ed.2d 560 (1979) ("[I]t is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with these unusually important precedents from this and other federal courts and that it expected its enactment to be interpreted in conformity with them.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that white men have standing to assert hostile environment claims under Title VII when the discriminatory conduct is directed at blacks or females. We believe that <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span> compels this result.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the <span class="Italic">Childress</span> opinion is consistent with the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> and, in the author's opinion, clearly is the correct view, the Fourth Circuit, <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, did not agree. In <span class="Italic">Childress v. City of Richmond</span>, 134 F.3d 1205 (4th Cir. 1998) <span class="Italic">(en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 118 S. Ct. 2322 (1998), the court reversed the panel's opinion and reinstated the judgment of the district court dismissing the claim in a short opinion, with virtually no rationale. A concurring opinion, written by Judge Luttig in <span class="Italic">Childress</span>, 134 F.3d at 1208-11, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiffs and the EEOC argue that Congress intended, through its use of the term "aggrieved persons" in Title VII, to authorize private causes of action for all persons who can satisfy Article III's standing requirements, regardless of whether those persons are themselves direct victims of an unlawful employment practice. In other words, they contend that Congress chose the phrase "aggrieved persons" in order to override all prudential standing limitations to bringing a Title VII action, effectively authorizing such actions to the limit permitted under constitutional standing doctrines. Under this interpretation, to be sure, the plaintiffs have stated a cause of action under Title VII because they allege that (1) the defendant discriminated against black and female employees in the "terms, conditions, or privileges" of their employment by creating a hostile work environment for blacks and women, and (2) the plaintiffs have suffered a sufficiently cognizable Article III injury caused by the defendant's unlawful employment practices--namely, the breakdown of esprit de corps that results from working in a racially or sexually polarized environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress, however, was not writing on a clean slate when it authorized "aggrieved persons" to bring Title VII actions. In the law, the phrase "aggrieved person" has long been a "term of art" ordinarily understood to mean those persons who could satisfy both prudential and constitutional standing limitations. In fact, the Supreme Court itself has recognized as much:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The phrase "person adversely affected or aggrieved" is a term of art used in many statutes to designate those who have standing to challenge or appeal an agency decision, within the agency or before the courts.... We have thus interpreted &#x00A7; 702 [the judicial review provision of the APA] as requiring a litigant to show at the outset of the case, that he is injured in fact by agency action and that the interest he seeks to vindicate is arguably within the "zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute" in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Director, OWCP v. Newport News</span>, 514 U.S. 122, 125, 115 S. Ct. 1278, 1283, 131 L. Ed.2d 160 (1995) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Kansas City Southern Industries v. Interstate Commerce Commission</span>, 902 F.2d 423, 429 (5th Cir. 1990) (observing in analysis of a different statute that "[t]o determine whether a petitioner is aggrieved, we generally incorporate traditional article III and prudential standing analysis"). Among the prudential limits on standing is not only the "zone of interests" requirement, but also, of course, the general prohibition against third-party standing. That is, "the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties." <span class="Italic">Warth v. Seldin</span>, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L. Ed.2d 343 (1975); <span class="Italic">see also Valley Forge College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State</span>, 454 U.S. 464, 474, 102 S. Ct. 752, 759-60, 70 L. Ed.2d 700 (1982). Congress may, if it chooses, override prudential standing limitations and authorize all persons who satisfy the Constitution's standing requirements to bring particular actions in federal court. But where it has not done so, and instead has simply invoked the term of art "aggrieved person," the default rule generally is that Congress has created a cause of action only for those persons who can satisfy both types of standing requirements--constitutional and prudential.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because Congress used the term of art "aggrieved person" in Title VII, and chose not to define that term for purposes of that statute; because the background understanding of "aggrieved person" includes prudential limits on standing; and because one of the primary prudential limitations is that a plaintiff cannot assert the rights and interests of another, I would interpret the term "person aggrieved" in Title VII so as to incorporate the prudential rule against third-party standing. Thus, in my view, in order to qualify as a "person aggrieved" authorized to bring a Title VII action, a plaintiff must be a member of the class of direct victims of conduct prohibited by Title VII, that is, the plaintiff must assert his own statutory rights and allege that he, not someone else, has been "discriminate[d] against...with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of [his] race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." It follows that, because the white male plaintiffs in the present case assert only the rights of third-parties to be free from race or sex-based discrimination in the workplace, they have not stated a cause of action under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although plaintiffs and the EEOC rely upon the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance</span>, 409 U.S. 205, 93 S. Ct. 364, 34 L. Ed.2d 415 (1972), not only do I find nothing in that opinion contrary to the conclusion I reach; I read that case to all but confirm this conclusion. In Trafficante, white tenants brought suit under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 against the owners of their apartment complex for allegedly discriminating against blacks in the renting of units in the housing complex. The Supreme Court held that Title VIII, which, like Title VII, authorizes "aggrieved persons" to bring civil actions to enforce its substantive prohibitions, authorizes a cause of action for any person meeting the Article III requirements--that is, any person genuinely injured by conduct that violates anyone's rights under the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike Title VII, which simply uses the term "aggrieved person" without definition, however, Title VIII also defines the term "aggrieved person" for purposes of that statute. And the statute defines "aggrieved person" broadly, in &#x00A7; 810, as "any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice." 409 U.S. at 206, 93 S. Ct. at 365 (quoting section 810(a) of Title VIII, today located at 42 USC &#x00A7; 3602(i)(1)). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>, the Supreme Court interpreted the phrase "aggrieved person" not as a term of art, but, rather, as a statutorily defined term. 409 U.S. at 208, 93 S. Ct. at 366; <span class="Italic">see also Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood</span>, 441 U.S. 91, 120-21, 99 S. Ct. 1601, 1618-19, 60 L. Ed.2d 66 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("In <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>...we held that the broad definition given 'person aggrieved' in &#x00A7; 810 indicated a congressional intent to accord apartment dwellers...an actionable right to be free from the adverse consequences flowing to them from racially discriminatory rental practices directed at third parties.") (emphasis added). Because the statutory definition of "aggrieved person" in Title VIII is so broad--even using the term "injury," a term of constitutional standing that references the outer limit of Congress' power to create causes of action--it is, of course, unsurprising that the Court concluded that Title VIII clearly authorizes a cause of action for all persons who suffer a constitutionally cognizable Article III injury-in-fact resulting from unlawful housing practices. And because Congress had statutorily eliminated the prudential standing requirements through its express definition, it is likewise unsurprising that the Court held that the white plaintiffs in Trafficante had standing to assert a claim for the loss of interracial associations resulting from living in a racially nonintegrated housing complex: The plaintiffs had suffered constitutional injury-in-fact, even though they had not themselves been the direct victims of discrimination but were asserting the rights of third party victims instead.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In notable contrast to Title VIII, Title VII does not define the term "aggrieved person." Not only does the complete absence of a definition in Title VII imply that Congress chose to incorporate the "term of art" definition of "aggrieved person," which, as discussed, includes prudential standing limitations; but the presence of a definition of the term in Title VIII juxtaposed with the absence of such a definition in Title VII strongly evidences that Congress intended different meanings for the term "aggrieved person" across the two statutes, further reinforcing the conclusion that "aggrieved person" in Title VII must be interpreted to incorporate prudential standing limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If any additional confirmation of the persuasiveness of this interpretation is needed, one need look only to the EEOC, the agency charged with administering Title VII. During oral argument before the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court, counsel for the EEOC herself argued--indeed, specifically on the authority of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Director, OWCP v. Newport News</span>--that "aggrieved person" is in fact a term of art that generally incorporates both prudential and constitutional limits on standing. (Although it was unclear precisely why she believed that this observation supported the EEOC's interpretation, as opposed to the one I describe above, I suppose she thought that it followed from the fact that the term is one of art, that the same meaning should be ascribed to the term in Title VII as in Title VIII.). But then, when confronted with the next obvious question of why, only four years after it enacted Title VII without a definition of "aggrieved person," Congress would have defined the same term in Title VIII, and defined it broadly as it did, if it was not to eliminate <span id="Page_860"></span>the prudential limitations that it believed would otherwise exist by virtue of the accepted understanding of the term, the agency's counsel could offer no explanation at all. Equally revealingly, in response to the related question of whether, under the EEOC's interpretation, the definition of "aggrieved person" in Title VIII would not be superfluous, counsel also could only agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That the EEOC itself would have no response to the first of these questions other than the obvious one, and that it would be obliged to answer the second in the affirmative, is, as far as I am concerned, essential confirmation of the error of the interpretation advanced by the plaintiffs and the EEOC, and in turn, of the correctness of the interpretation of Title VII upon which I primarily rest my decision today.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>
