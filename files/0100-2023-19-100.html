<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-93"><span class="space">A.</span> AFTER-ACQUIRED EVIDENCE DOCTRINE</h3>
<p class="noindent">A defense known as the "after-acquired evidence" doctrine limits the period of time for which a complainant can receive relief. The defense does not focus on what an employer would have done in the absence of discrimination. Rather, it focuses on discovering employee misconduct that predates the discrimination. With such evidence in hand, employers then argue that, had they previously known of the misconduct, they would not have hired the employee in the first place or would have fired the employee prior to any discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "after-acquired evidence" doctrine was first successfully used as a defense in an ADEA case. In <span class="Italic">Summers v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 700 (10th Cir. 1988), the employer was successful in obtaining summary judgment in an age discrimination case where it demonstrated that the plaintiff engaged in over 150 incidents of record falsification. Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Churchman v. Pinkerton's, Inc.</span>, 756 F. Supp. 515 (D. Kan. 1991), the court used the doctrine to grant summary judgment to the employer in a sexual harassment case where the employee falsified her original employment application and the employer was able to further demonstrate that it routinely terminated employees for such falsification. In <span class="Italic">Churchman</span>, 756 F. Supp. at 519-21, the court explained both the origins and parameters of the doctrine:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Tenth Circuit understood the defendant to be arguing that because of plaintiff's pervasive misconduct, which was not discovered until long after the plaintiff was discharged, he is barred from any relief. 864 F.2d at 705. In its discussion of the law, the circuit court first made clear that this evidence does not relate to the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> approach nor the reasons for the plaintiff's discharge. 864 F.2d at 704-05. The court then discussed a number of cases making the point that such evidence of misconduct would show the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief as he was not qualified for the job and would not have been hired or would have been terminated if the truth had been known. In order to reach the ultimate question presented by such evidence, is the plaintiff entitled to any relief, the court said it must be assumed the defendant acted in part on an unlawful, discriminatory motive. 864 F.2d at 708. The court then held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To argue, as Summers does, that this after-acquired evidence should be ignored is utterly unrealistic. The present case is akin to the hypothetical wherein a company doctor is fired because of his age, race, religion, and sex and the company, in defending a civil rights action, thereafter discovers that the discharged employee was not a "doctor." In our view, the masquerading doctor would be entitled to no relief, and Summers is in no better position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">864 F.2d at 708. Because the plaintiff did not deny any of the falsifications and had been warned that such action could result in discharge, the Tenth Circuit agreed this was a case appropriate for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Summers</span> decision has been applied by two district courts in the Tenth Circuit and cited by at least one circuit court. The Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Smith v. General Scanning, Inc.</span>, 876 F.2d 1315, 1319 (7th Cir. 1989), echoed the holding in <span class="Italic">Summers</span> that after-acquired evidence of resume fraud is not relevant under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> scheme but could be highly relevant as to the availability of relief. "[I]t would hardly make sense to order Smith reinstated to a job which he lied to get and from which he properly could be discharged for that lie." 876 F.2d at 1319 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Judge Kelly had the opportunity to apply the <span class="Italic">Summers</span> decision in the case of <span class="Italic">Mathis v. Boeing Military Airplane Co.</span>, 719 F. Supp. 991 (D. Kan. 1989). Plaintiff alleged harassment at the workplace and unlawful denial of terms and conditions of employment due to her race and sex, and she further alleged retaliatory discharge for filing a discrimination complaint. More than a year after her termination, the defendant discovered that plaintiff failed to disclose on her employment application one felony conviction for fraud and her employment history with three federal agencies, all of which had terminated her for cause. Judge Kelly rejected plaintiff's attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">Summers</span> on the degree of misconduct, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the instant case, material omissions were made by plaintiff on the employment application. They were material for the simple reason that defendant relied upon such omissions in hiring plaintiff. Additionally, the obvious difference in the number of falsifications has little impact on the level of wrongdoing in the present case. In <span class="Italic">Summers</span>, the 150 falsifications were directly related to the employee's work. By the same token, plaintiff's omission of her unfavorable work record is directly related to her employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">719 F. Supp. at 994-95. In other words, summary judgment is appropriate where the material omissions are directly related to measuring a candidate for employment and were relied upon in the hiring decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the rationale from <span class="Italic">Summers</span> was called upon in the case of <span class="Italic">O'Driscoll v. Hercules</span>, 745 F. Supp. 656 (D. Utah 1990). Plaintiff alleged her termination violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII. During preparation for trial, the defendant discovered that the plaintiff on her employment application had misrepresented her age, the age of her children, the year of her high school graduation, and the fact that she had never previously applied for work with defendant. The plaintiff opposed summary judgment arguing the misrepresentations were not serious enough to sustain the <span class="Italic">Summers</span> holding. The court refused to apply any certain threshold in favor of weighing a combination of subjective and objective factors:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">O'Driscoll's contention that an employee's misconduct must, as a threshold matter, be "serious and pervasive" before <span class="Italic">Summers</span> applies is without merit. The "serious and pervasive" nature of an employee's misconduct, however, is not excluded from the <span class="Italic">Summers</span> <span id="Page_769"></span>analysis entirely. An employer must show that misconduct was such that an employee would have been terminated had the employer known of the misconduct before or at the time of termination. This requirement prevents an employer from combing an employee's file after a discriminatory termination to discover minor, trivial or technical infractions for use in a <span class="Italic">Summers</span> defense. On this motion for summary judgment [the employer] must show that as a matter of law O'Driscoll would have been terminated had the company known of her misconduct. While there was no serious question in <span class="Italic">Summers</span> that the employee would have been terminated if the employer had known of the employee's misconduct, the question is a closer one in the present case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">745 F. Supp. at 659. The employer submitted affidavits to the effect that plaintiff would have been terminated had it known of the misrepresentations. The plaintiff called the affidavits "self-serving," but the court saw them as unrebutted evidence of what reasonable management would do under the circumstances. The plaintiff also attempted to show that her termination for these misrepresentations was not consistent with company policy and was not consistent with punishment levied for different infractions by other employees. The court was unable to make any inferences from such evidence to cast doubt on the defendant's statement that plaintiff would have been promptly terminated had the misrepresentations been discovered.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Sixth Circuit subsequently followed suit and approved use of the doctrine in <span class="Italic">Milligan-Jensen v. Michigan Technological University</span>, 975 F.2d 302 (6th Cir. 1992). The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to review the question. The U.S. Solicitor General, with the concurrence of the EEOC, filed a brief with the Court opposing the doctrine. However, the parties subsequently settled before the case could be heard.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1994, the Sixth Circuit again provided the Supreme Court with an opportunity to review the "after-acquired evidence" doctrine. In <span class="Italic">McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Company</span>, 513 U.S. 352, 115 S. Ct. 879, 130 L. Ed.2d 852 (1995), the Supreme Court approved limited use of the doctrine in an age discrimination case. In <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, the employee, who was 62 years old and had 30 years experience with the company, was terminated during an overall work force reduction. McKennon filed suit alleging that she was terminated on the basis of age.</p>
<p class="noindent">During a deposition prior to the trial, McKennon admitted that over the final year of her employment she removed confidential documents from the company regarding its financial conditions. She testified that she did so because she was concerned about her prospects for future employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the district court level, for the purposes of summary judgment, the employer conceded discrimination and contended that, had it known of her removal of the documents, it would have terminated her employment for cause. The district court granted summary judgment for the employer and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Kennedy authored the unanimous decision of the Court. Ultimately, the Court issued a Solomon-like decision holding that "after-acquired evidence" did not present a complete bar to relief under the antidiscrimination statutes, but could limit the relief available to an individual plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court determined that the ADEA, like Title VII, has the dual purpose of eliminating discrimination in the workplace and providing relief for those injured by discrimination. The purpose of eliminating discrimination in the workplace would not be served by permitting "after-acquired evidence" to be used as an absolute bar to a complaint of discrimination. Justice Kennedy, writing the opinion in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, 115 S. Ct. at 883-87, stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals considered McKennon's misconduct, in effect, to be supervening grounds for termination. That may be so, but it does not follow, as the Court of Appeals said in citing one of its own earlier cases, that the misconduct renders it "'irrelevant whether or not [McKennon] was discriminated against.'" 9 F.3d, at 542, <span class="Italic">quoting Milligan-Jensen v. Michigan Technological Univ.</span>, 975 F.2d 302, 305 (CA6 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, 509 U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 2991, 125 L. Ed.2d 686, <span class="Italic">cert. dism'd</span>, 509 U.S. __, 114 S. Ct. 22, 125 L. Ed.2d 773 (1993). We conclude that a violation of the ADEA cannot be so altogether disregarded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADEA, enacted in 1967 as part of an ongoing congressional effort to eradicate discrimination in the workplace, reflects a societal condemnation of invidious bias in employment decisions. The ADEA is but part of a wider statutory scheme to protect employees in the workplace nationwide. <span class="Italic">See</span> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (1988 ed. and Supp. V) (race, color, sex, national origin, and religion); the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USC &#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (1988 ed., Supp. V) (disability); the National Labor Relations Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 158(a) (union activities); the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 USC &#x00A7; 206(d) (sex). The ADEA incorporates some features of both Title VII and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which has led us to describe it as "something of a hybrid." <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 578, 98 S. Ct. 866, 869, 55 L. Ed.2d 40 (1978). The substantive, antidiscrimination provisions of the ADEA are modeled upon the prohibitions of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston</span>, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 621, 83 L. Ed.2d 523 (1985); <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons, supra</span>, at 584, 98 S. Ct., at 872. Its remedial provisions incorporate by reference the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(b). When confronted with a violation of the ADEA, a district court is authorized to afford relief by means of reinstatement, backpay, injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and attorney's fees. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(b); <span class="Italic">see also Lorillard v. Pons, supra</span>, at 584, 98 S. Ct., at 872. In the case of a willful violation of the Act, the ADEA authorizes an award of liquidated damages equal to the backpay award. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(b). The Act also gives federal courts the discretion to "grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of [the Act]." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADEA and Title VII share common substantive features and also a common purpose: "the elimination of discrimination in the workplace." <span class="Italic">Oscar Mayer &#x0026; Co. v. Evans</span>, 441 U.S. 750, 756, 99 S. Ct. 2066, 2071, 60 L. Ed.2d 609 (1979). Congress designed the remedial measures in these statutes to serve as a "spur or catalyst" to cause employers "to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges" of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 417-418, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2371-72, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.</span>, 424 U.S. 747, 763, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 1263, 47 L. Ed.2d 444 (1976). Deterrence is one object of these statutes. Compensation for injuries caused by the prohibited discrimination is another. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra</span>, at 418, 95 S. Ct., at 2372; <span class="Italic">Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., supra</span>, at 763-764, 96 S. Ct., at 1263-1264. The ADEA, in keeping with these purposes, contains a vital element found in both Title VII and the Fair Labor Standards Act: it grants an injured employee a right of action to obtain the authorized relief. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(c). The private litigant who seeks redress for his or her injuries vindicates both the deterrence and the compensation objectives of the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36, 45, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 1018, 39 L. Ed.2d 147 (1974) ("[T]he private litigant [in Title VII] not only redresses his own injury but also vindicates the important congressional policy against discriminatory employment practices"); <span class="Italic">see also International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 364, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1869, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977). It would not accord with this scheme if after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing that would have resulted in termination operates, in every instance, to bar all relief for an earlier violation of the Act. The objectives of the ADEA are furthered when even a single employee establishes that an employer has discriminated against him or her. The disclosure through litigation of incidents or practices which violate national policies respecting nondiscrimination in the work force is itself important, for the occurrence of violations may disclose patterns of noncompliance resulting from a misappreciation of the Act's operation or entrenched resistance to its commands, either of which can be of industry-wide significance. The efficacy of its enforcement mechanisms becomes one measure of the success of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals in this case relied upon two of its earlier decisions, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Honeywell Information Systems, Inc.</span>, 955 F.2d 409 (CA6 1992); <span class="Italic">Milligan-Jensen v. Michigan Technological Univ.</span>, 975 F.2d 302 (CA6 1992), and the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Summers v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 700 (1988). Consulting those authorities, it declared that it had "firmly endorsed the principle that after-acquired evidence is a complete bar to any recovery by the former employee where the employer can show it would have fired the employee on the basis of the evidence." 9 F.3d, at 542. <span class="Italic">Summers</span>, in turn, relied upon our decision in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977), but that decision is inapplicable here. In <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> we addressed a mixed-motives case, in which two motives were said to be operative in the employer's decision to fire an employee. One was lawful, the other (an alleged constitutional violation) unlawful. We held that if the lawful reason alone would have sufficed to justify the firing, the employee could not prevail in a suit against the employer. The case was controlled by the difficulty, and what we thought was the lack of necessity, of disentangling the proper motive from the improper one where both played a part in the termination and the former motive would suffice to sustain the employer's action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 284-287, 97 S. Ct., at 574-576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That is not the problem confronted here. As we have said, the case comes to us on the express assumption that an unlawful motive was the sole basis for the firing. McKennon's misconduct was not discovered until after she had been fired. The employer could not have been motivated by knowledge it did not have and it cannot now claim that the employee was fired for the nondiscriminatory reason. Mixed motive cases are inapposite here, except to the important extent they underscore the necessity of determining the employer's motives in ordering the discharge, an essential element in determining whether the employer violated the federal antidiscrimination law. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 252, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1791, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion) (employer's legitimate reason for discharge in mixed-motive case will not suffice "if that reason did not motivate it at the time of the decision");<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, <span id="Page_770"></span>at 260-261, 109 S. Ct., at 1795-1796 (White, J., concurring in judgment);<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 261, 109 S. Ct., at 1796 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment). As we have observed, "proving that the same decision would have been justified. . .is not the same as proving that the same decision would have been made."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 252, 109 S. Ct., at 1791 (plurality) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span>, at 260-261, 109 S. Ct., at 1795-1796 (White, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our inquiry is not at an end, however, for even though the employer has violated the Act, we must consider how the after-acquired evidence of the employee's wrongdoing bears on the specific remedy to be ordered. Equity's maxim that a suitor who engaged in his own reprehensible conduct in the course of the transaction at issue must be denied equitable relief because of unclean hands, a rule which in conventional formulation operated <span class="Italic">in limine</span> to bar the suitor from invoking the aid of the equity court, 2 S. Symons, <span class="Italic">Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence</span> &#x00A7; 397, pp. 90-92 (5th ed. 1941), has not been applied where Congress authorizes broad equitable relief to serve important national policies. We have rejected the unclean hands defense "where a private suit serves important public purposes." <span class="Italic">Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp.</span>, 392 U.S. 134, 138, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 1984, 20 L. Ed.2d 982 (1968) (Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts). That does not mean, however, the employee's own misconduct is irrelevant to all the remedies otherwise available under the statute. The statute controlling this case provides that "the court shall have jurisdiction to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including without limitation judgments compelling employment, reinstatement or promotion, or enforcing the liability for [amounts owing to a person as a result of a violation of this chapter]." 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> &#x00A7; 216(b). In giving effect to the ADEA, we must recognize the duality between the legitimate interests of the employer and the important claims of the employee who invokes the national employment policy mandated by the Act. The employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account, we conclude, lest the employer's legitimate concerns be ignored. The ADEA, like Title VII, is not a general regulation of the workplace but a law which prohibits discrimination. The statute does not constrain employers from exercising significant other prerogatives and discretions in the course of the hiring, promoting, and discharging of their employees. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, supra</span>, 490 U.S. at 239, 109 S. Ct., at 1784 ("Title VII eliminates certain bases for distinguishing among employees while otherwise preserving employers' freedom of choice"). In determining appropriate remedial action, the employee's wrongdoing becomes relevant not to punish the employee, or out of concern "for the relative moral worth of the parties," <span class="Italic">Perma Mufflers v. International Parts Corp.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 139, 88 S. Ct., at 1984, but to take due account of the lawful prerogatives of the employer in the usual course of its business and the corresponding equities that it has arising from the employee's wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proper boundaries of remedial relief in the general class of cases where, after termination, it is discovered that the employee has engaged in wrongdoing must be addressed by the judicial system in the ordinary course of further decisions, for the factual permutations and the equitable considerations they raise will vary from case to case. We do conclude that here, and as a general rule in cases of this type, neither reinstatement nor front pay is an appropriate remedy. It would be both inequitable and pointless to order the reinstatement of someone the employer would have terminated, and will terminate, in any event and upon lawful grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proper measure of backpay presents a more difficult problem. Resolution of this question must give proper recognition to the fact that an ADEA violation has occurred which must be deterred and compensated without undue infringement upon the employer's rights and prerogatives. The object of compensation is to restore the employee to the position he or she would have been in absent the discrimination, <span class="Italic">Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.</span>, 424 U.S., at 764, 96 S. Ct., at 1264, but that principle is difficult to apply with precision where there is after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing that would have led to termination on legitimate grounds had the employer known about it. Once an employer learns about employee wrongdoing that would lead to a legitimate discharge, we cannot require the employer to ignore the information, even if it is acquired during the course of discovery in a suit against the employer and even if the information might have gone undiscovered absent the suit. The beginning point in the trial court's formulation of a remedy should be calculation of backpay from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered. In determining the appropriate order for relief, the court can consider taking into further account extraordinary equitable circumstances that affect the legitimate interests of either party. An absolute rule barring any recovery of backpay, however, would undermine the ADEA's objective of forcing employers to consider and examine their motivations, and of penalizing them for employment decisions that spring from age discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an employer seeks to rely upon after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing, it must first establish that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the discharge. The concern that employers might as a routine matter undertake extensive discovery into an employee's background or performance on the job to resist claims under the Act is not an insubstantial one, but we think the authority of the courts to award attorney's fees, mandated under the statute, 29 USC &#x00A7; 216(b), 626(b), and in appropriate cases to invoke the provisions of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will deter most abuses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, the Commission held that it is not improper for an agency to terminate an employee on the basis that she submitted false information on her employment application when the agency's discovery was prompted by the complainant's own actions. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01934379 (1994). In that case, it was the complainant's actions that initiated a congressional inquiry during which the agency discovered that the complainant misrepresented her educational credentials. Without specifically mentioning <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, the Commission has held that an agency could not rely on discipline five years prior to the nonselection where it was unaware of the discipline at the time of the nonselection and it "most likely would not have been discovered by the agency during the application process,. . ." <span class="Italic">Seago v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 07A60030 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Castle v. Rubin</span>, 78 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the court rejected an argument that the "after-acquired evidence" doctrine, approved by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, did not apply to federal employees because the case involved a private sector employment dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The subsequent discovery that an unsuccessful candidate for an administrative law judge position had been in an inactive bar status did not exonerate the agency from discrimination in the selection process. <span class="Italic">Guido v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07A10004 (2003). In addition, the Commission found that the complainant was entitled to reinstatement and back pay unless the agency could demonstrate that it would not have selected him based on his inactive status. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Guido</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the agency's argument that complainant was not qualified to be an ALJ based on his status as an inactive member of the Indiana bar, we first note that this argument does not, as the agency asserts, go to whether complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Rather, we find that the evidence of complainant's status with the Indiana Bar is after-acquired evidence which does not bar the agency's liability for having engaged in unlawfully discriminatory conduct<span class="Italic">. See McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.</span>, 513 U.S. 352 (1995) (holding that an employee discharged in violation of the ADEA is entitled to relief even if the employer subsequently discovers evidence of wrongdoing that would have led to the employee's termination on legitimate grounds); <span class="Italic">see</span> also EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on After-Acquired Evidence and</span> <span class="Italic">McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.</span> (<span class="Italic">McKennon</span> Guidance) (December 14, 1995) (interpreting <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> and noting that even where the agency proves that it would have taken the same or more harsh adverse action had it known of the employee misconduct, complainant will still be entitled to relief, but that relief may be subject to some limitations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, after failing to select complainant for an ALJ position and, indeed, after the AJ determined that this failure was motivated by complainant's age, the agency acquired evidence which established that complainant was an inactive member of the Indiana Bar between June 19, 1995 and January 4, 1999. The agency asserts that complainant was therefore not minimally qualified for the ALJ position and that his complaint should be dismissed. The Supreme Court has held, however, that after-acquired evidence such as this does not defeat an employer's liability for violating the ADEA<span class="Italic">. See McKennon, supra</span>. The Court found that in such cases the ADEA violation that actually prompted the adverse action could not be ignored<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Instead, the Court concluded that after-acquired evidence bears upon the remedy afforded to the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> stated that where an employer seeks to rely upon after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing to limit the amount of damages, it must first establish that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone had the employer known of the conduct at the time of the discharge<span class="Italic">. See McKennon</span>, <span class="Italic">supra; see also Martindale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01954423 (December 9, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this principle to the case at hand, we find that in order to establish that complainant is not entitled to reinstatement and back pay from the time of his non-selection through the present, the agency must establish that complainant's inactive status was such that had the agency known about it prior to making its selection determinations, it would, on that basis alone, have rejected complainant's application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note, however, that even assuming that the agency can, on remand, establish that complainant's inactive status would have resulted in his non-selection even absent discrimination, complainant is nonetheless entitled to back pay from the date of his non-selection to the date that the agency discovered that complainant was allegedly not qualified, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the date on which it received information from the Indiana <span id="Page_771"></span>Bar that complainant was in inactive status<span class="Italic">. See McKennon</span> Guidance, p. 5 (where an employee's misconduct is so severe that an employer would have taken the same or harsher adverse action even absent discrimination, back pay may generally be limited to the period from the date of the unlawful employment action to the date that the misconduct was discovered).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the AJ's determination that complainant was subjected to age-based discrimination when he was not selected for an ALJ position is supported by substantial evidence. However, we remand the matter for further processing in accordance with this decision and the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mixed motive cases and after-acquired evidence cases are often confused. In <span class="Italic">Harvey D. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120122385 (2015), the Commission explained the difference between the two defenses in case where the agency denied the complainant a position based on its "worldwide availability" requirement. The agency determined that the complainant was not available worldwide due to a medical condition. The Commission ordered the complainant's retroactive appointment to a junior officer position. The agency subsequently discovered that the complainant was not eligible for employment in the executive branch because he had failed to register for the Selective Service System. In rejecting the agency's argument that the situation presented a mixed motive case, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Harvey D</span>., explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts on appeal that this is a 'mixed motive' case, and that Complainant therefore is not eligible for compensatory damages and back pay. Cases which have evidence that discrimination was one of multiple motivating factors for an employment action, that is, that the employer acted on the bases of both lawful and unlawful reasons, are known as "mixed motive" cases. Once a Complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the employer's action, the burden shifts to the employer to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have made the same decision, even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 249, 258 (1989); <span class="Italic">Tellez v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A41133 (Mar. 18, 2005). Given that Agency officials were unaware that Complainant had not filed with the SSS at the time of the discrimination, we are not persuaded by the Agency's untimely argument that this is a mixed-motive case, and find the theory has no bearing on the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, we find that the evidence of Complainant's unsuitability constitutes after-acquired evidence, which does not bar the Agency's liability for having engaged in unlawfully discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing, Co</span>., 513 U.S. 352 (1995) (holding that an employee discharged in violation of the ADEA is entitled to relief even if the employer subsequently discovers evidence of wrongdoing that would have led to the employee's termination on legitimate grounds); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on After-Acquired Evidence and</span> <span class="Italic">McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing, Co</span>.(<span class="Italic">McKennon</span> Guidance) (Dec. 14, 1995) (interpreting <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> and noting that even where employer proves that it would have taken the same or more harsh adverse action had it known of employee misconduct, complainant will still be entitled to relief, but that relief may be subject to limitation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that the Agency discriminated against Complainant in 2003 when it denied him a Class 1 medical clearance without conducting an individualized assessment into whether his alleged disability constituted a direct threat. Seven years later, it discovered that Complainant was not suitable for employment with the Foreign Service because he had not registered with the SSS, and therefore was not eligible for appointment to an Executive Agency. Nonetheless, the Agency's failure to comply with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act still occurred, and should not be overlooked because of the subsequently acquired evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the Supreme Court held that after-acquired evidence such as this does not defeat an employer's liability for employment discrimination, and should not serve as a basis to ignore the underlying violation. <span class="Italic">See McKennon, supra</span>. Instead, the Court concluded that after-acquired evidence can bear upon the remedy afforded to the complainant. The Court in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> stated that, where an employer seeks to rely upon after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing to limit the amount of damages, it must first establish that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone had the employer known of the conduct at the time of the discharge. <span class="Italic">See McKennon, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Guido v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10004, <span class="Italic">req. for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30976 (Oct. 21, 2003) (after-acquired evidence that ALJ was inactive Member of the Bar and thus unlicensed for period of four years did not nullify AJ's finding that nonselection was discriminatory and back pay was owed, but issue of reinstatement was remanded for evidence that agency would have acted on this evidence alone had it known about it); <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980191 (May 7, 1999) (supplemental investigation ordered to consider whether after-acquired evidence of false statements in application would have been grounds for non-hire; back pay and compensatory damages investigation ordered); <span class="Italic">Martindale v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01954423 (Dec. 9, 1997) (remedy was limited to back pay in light of evidence that complainant would have been terminated on the basis of his falsified application alone).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in order to establish that Complainant is not entitled to reinstatement and back pay, the Agency must establish that Complainant's unsuitability was of such severity that, had the Agency known about it prior to making its selection determinations, it would, on that basis alone, have rejected Complainant's application. We find that, in light of OPM's determination that Complainant is not eligible for appointment to an Executive Agency position, this matter is of such severity that, had the Agency known about it prior to the selection, it would have rejected Complainant's application. Accordingly, we find a retroactive placement to a Junior Officer position is not an available remedy in his case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Complainant is nonetheless entitled to back pay from the date of his non-selection to the date on which the Agency discovered that Complainant was not suitable, i.e., the date on which it learned that Complainant had not registered for the SSS. <span class="Italic">See McKennon</span> Guidance, p. 5 (where employee's misconduct is so severe that employer would have taken same or harsher adverse action even absent discrimination, back pay may generally be limited to period from date of unlawful employment action to date that misconduct was discovered); <span class="Italic">see also, Guido</span>, EEOC Request No. EEOC Appeal No. 07A10004, <span class="Italic">req. for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30976. Accordingly, the Agency will pay back pay in accordance with our order below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the compensatory damages award, we note that the purpose of compensatory damages is to compensate an individual for injuries or losses sustained as a result of discrimination, and nothing in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> suggests that compensatory damages for emotional harm should be time-limited. Victims may suffer an injury from discrimination regardless of whether a legitimate reason for an adverse action is subsequently discovered. <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> Guidance. Accordingly, we find no support for the Agency's position that Complainant is not entitled to a compensatory damage award based on the after-acquired evidence. <span class="Italic">See Benjamin</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980191 (remand for supplemental investigation into entitlement for compensatory damages after application of after acquired evidence rule).</p>
