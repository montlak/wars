<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-54"><span class="space">b.</span> Adverse Tax Consequences of a Back Pay Award</h5>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, awards of back pay and compensatory damages can have an effect on the income tax bracket of a complainant because the IRS taxes income in the year it is received without regard for the fact that money is remuneration that should have been received in past tax years. This is not a criticism of the IRS--far be it for the author to engage in such criticism; this is simply the way the tax code is structured. However, the net result is that the complainant does not receive as much money as he or she would have but for the discrimination, which is the purpose of relief under Title VII, because a larger amount is paid in income tax.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is liable to the complainant for the tax consequences of a back pay award when it results in the complainant paying more taxes. The Commission in <span class="italic">Chastity L. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2019002167 (2022), wrote:</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">An award to cover additional tax liability from a lump sum payment of back pay is available to complainants. <span class="italic">See Felicidad S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120180637 (June 4, 2019); <span class="italic">Goetze v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (Aug. 22, 2001); <span class="italic">Holler v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982627 &#x0026; 01990407 (Aug. 22, 2001); <span class="italic">Van Hoose v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982628 &#x0026; 01990455 (Aug. 22, 2001). When back pay is awarded in a lump sum, individuals are compensated for the extra tax that they are required to pay as a result of receiving a lump sum pay award, as opposed to the actual amount of taxes that they would have paid if they had received the funds over a period of time, usually several years. <span class="italic">Felicidad S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120180637. It is the receipt of the funds in one lump sum that causes the extra tax liability, not the backpay award itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency must compensate Petitioner for any additional tax consequences of the issuance of the lump sum for estimated back pay without any deductions in 2020. <span class="italic">See Stefan H. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420150008 (Feb. 18, 2016) (ordering agency to pay petitioner additional payment for continued tax liability because of the clear intent of the Commission's order "was to ensure that Petitioner was not required to pay any additional taxes" as a result of the lump sum payment) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner, who bears the burden of proof, must submit evidence showing the difference between the taxes that she paid on the lump-sum payment and the taxes that she would have paid had the salary been earned over time. <span class="italic">See Dellinger v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A40040 (Sept. 29, 2005) (burden of proof to establish amount of additional tax liability is on complainant); <span class="italic">Darlene F. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </span>EEOC Petition No. 0420140010 (Apr. 8, 2016). Petitioner must show more than the total tax liability arising from receipt of the lump-sum award; she must show the differential between this tax burden and the taxes that she would have paid if she had received the back pay as part of her salary. <span class="italic">Johnson v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420060035 (Nov. 5, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner must "provide exact and detailed calculations showing the amount he is claiming." <span class="italic">Emerson S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 0420130026 (Nov. 20, 2015). Accordingly, Petitioner shall be afforded a reasonable amount of time to submit evidence to the Agency on the adverse tax consequences. We have found 180 calendar days after the issuance of an EEOC decision is a reasonable amount of time in which to submit evidence of tax consequences. <span class="italic">Terrence H. v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2021000610 (Mar. 21, 2022).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Goetze v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01991530 (2001), the Commission remanded a case to the administrative judge for a calculation of the tax consequences, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant argues that he should be compensated for the alleged adverse tax consequence of receiving over five years of back pay in one year<span class="Italic">. Sears v. Atchison,</span> <span class="Italic">Topeka &#x0026; Santa Fe Railway, Company</span>, 749 F.2d 1451, 1456 (1984), a Title VII employment discrimination case, found that a district court may include a tax component in a back pay award to compensate class members for their increased taxes as a result of receiving over 17 years of back pay in one lump sum. The court in <span class="Italic">O'Neill v. Sears, Roebuck and Company</span>, 108 F. Supp.2d 443, 446-47 (E.D. Penn. 2000) found that make whole relief under the ADEA for a terminated employee included an award for the tax consequences of receiving back and front pay all in one year rather than income being earned over time. The court explained that the goal of the ADEA is to allow a plaintiff to keep the same amount of money he would have earned had he not been unlawfully terminated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the equitable remedy of an award to cover <span id="Page_1747"></span>additional tax liability of receiving back pay in a lump sum is not available. In light of the above cases, we disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant avers that he paid an additional $102,863 in taxes as a result of the lump sum back pay awards he received in March 1998. Using the 1997 total tax rates, the complainant indicated that the March 1998 lump sum back payments with interest was subject to taxation by the federal government at 33.9%, and by the state of California at 8.6%. The complainant averred that the average federal and state tax rates between 1989 to 1992, respectively, were 13.6% and 3.6%, and he was entitled to reimbursement for the difference between the earlier average rates and the 1997 rates. He also indicated that subsequent lump sum payments resulted in some additional extra tax liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the earlier rates, for the most part, are not derived from the correct years, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> those during the back pay period. Further, the complainant used the 1997 tax rates for back pay received in 1998. The calculations do not indicate the amount of taxes the complainant would have paid during the back pay period had he not been removed, a probative measure. Moreover, they are not broken down by year, and do not take into account deductions and other factors that would affect his taxes. Courts that discuss claims for compensation for additional tax liability stemming from a lump sum payment have demanded probative calculations by complainants<span class="Italic">. Barbour v. Medlantic Management Corp.,</span> 952 F. Supp. 857, 865 (D.C. 1997) (denied award due to failure to provide evidence on difference between taxes paid on lump sum front pay award and amount of taxes that would have been paid had the salary been earned over time); <span class="Italic">Hukkanen v. International Union of Operating Engineers,</span> 3 F.3d 281, 287 (8th Cir. 1993) (district court may deny award where the plaintiff failed to provide evidence on the enhancement amount or convenient way for the court to calculate it).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant has the burden of establishing the amount of increased tax liability<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 287. This matter is remanded to the Hearings Unit of the Los Angeles EEOC district office in accordance with the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission issued similar remand orders in the related cases of <span class="Italic">Lutrell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01981988 (2001) and <span class="Italic">Van Hoose v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01982628 (2001). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Arreola v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03342 (2002); <span class="Italic">Campos v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03368 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Payment of the increased tax liability is part of the make-whole relief and does not need to be specifically ordered by the administrative judge as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120113877 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency determined that Complainant was not entitled to such relief because the AJ's order was silent as to any payment for Complainant's increased tax liability in the back pay award. The Commission has held that where an agency pays back pay and other income payments in a lump sum payment the agency is responsible for a petitioner's proven increased income tax burden. EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (Aug. 22, 2001); EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982627 &#x0026; 01990407 (Aug. 22, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to receive compensation for increased taxes due to a lump sum payment, however, the complainant must thoroughly document the effect of the payment on taxes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alcala v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A14299 (2002). In <span class="Italic">Faustino M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019003289 (2019), the Commission noted the standard of such proof as "exact and detailed calculations showing the amount" the complainant is claiming. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Faustino M</span>. met that standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing Commission cases, Complainant argues that that when the AJ awarded him back pay with benefits, this includes tax consequences resulting from receiving his wages all in the form of a lump sum back pay payment in one tax year. We agree. <span class="Italic">See Simon V. v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141013 (Feb. 9, 2017) (when the Commission refers to "benefits" in the context of equitable relief, it construes this term broadly to include additional tax liability resulting from lump-sum payments for back pay awards). Citing a Commission case, Complainant also argues that to be made whole on his back pay, the Agency must pay him sufficient tax consequences to cover the increased taxes resulting from lump sum payment of the tax consequences, and a solution to this is "grossing up" them up. We agree. <span class="Italic">See Stephen H. v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420150008 (Feb. 18, 2016) (to avoid a continuing cycle of "infinite regress," meaning a sequence of events that would never end, the Commission approved the "grossing up" the petitioner's tax consequence calculation, as made by H&#x0026;R Block, where the agency provided no refutation of the amount the petitioner requested).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden is on Complainant to prove his tax consequences with exact and detailed calculations showing the amount he is claiming. <span class="Italic">Emerson S. v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420130026(Nov. 20, 2015). Complainant's request for $93,949 in tax consequences met this burden. He provided a February 15, 2017, letter with attached calculations by an accountant who is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)/Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) and his state and federal tax returns for 2010-2016. The accountant explained that she went back to Complainant's original tax returns for each year and entered the amount of taxes actually paid with what he would have paid if he received his salary in the normal course in those years to determine the tax impact. The accountant then compared the total taxes Complainant should have paid in 2010-2016 to the taxes he paid in his 2016 tax returns, and arrived at a figure of $56,790 in federal and Maryland state tax consequences. The accountant than applied a regression analysis to calculate the amount of additional tax consequences caused by receiving the $56,790 in a lump sum in 2017 to result in no additional tax liability to Complainant, and arrived at a total figure of $93,949 in tax consequences due Complainant. The accountant explained that she deducted any unemployment compensation Complainant received during the back pay period in running the analysis, and assumed a base salary of $60,000 for the infinite regression schedule for 2017. As of November 2016, Complainant's annual base salary (not including night differential and Sunday premium pay), was $57,493.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take administrative notice that after Complainant's accountant calculated the gross up amount in 2017, there was a significant change in income tax law effective in 2018, and this could impact taxes due as a result of receiving the additional tax consequence payment. Should the Agency wish Complainant to revise his gross up figure, it may ask him to do so, with the understanding that the Agency will be responsible for the additional attorney and accountant fees and costs associated with doing this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because it appears the revised back pay due is relatively small and to create the conditions to allow this litigation to close, we exercise our discretion to decline Complainant an additional entitlement to tax consequences resulting from his receipt of the revised back pay in a lump sum.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 04A40035 (2005) (demanding "probative calculations" to prove the amount of her increased federal income tax liability). Failure to provide proof of such calculations will result in a denial of an award to cover the tax consequences of a lump sum or back pay award. In <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52449.txt">01A52449</a> (2006), the Commission denied an award of damages to cover the tax consequences of a lump sum back pay award where the complainant failed to present sufficient information to allow the agency to calculate the tax consequences. In <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, the Commission noted that this would normally come in the form of evidence from a tax expert, such as a certified public accountant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Secretary of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a61644.txt">01A61644</a> (2006) (damages for increased tax liability denied where complainant failed to provide tax returns so agency could do independent analysis). In <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520050169 (2006), the Commission rejected the complainant's petition for reconsideration arguing that he was precluded from presenting tax information to the complainant finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, complainant argues that he was unable to calculate the amount of the adverse tax consequences until an award was granted. The Commission, however, is not persuaded by complainant's contentions. At the hearing on damages, the complainant could have provided some estimate, based upon what he was requesting for back pay and front pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternatively, he could have provided the AJ a method for how to calculate it. Complainant failed to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, when complainant raised the matter in his appeal to the Commission, he again failed to provide calculations and supporting documentation. He simply requested, as he does now, that the matter be remanded to the AJ for a determination. In his request for reconsideration, he has the specific amounts awarded, in both the AJ decision and his appeal, upon which to base his calculations. Yet, complainant has not provided us with any detailed information with regard to the amount he should be compensated. We find that complainant has not met his burden of proving that he was entitled to compensation for the increased tax liability caused by the lump sum payment of back pay and front pay. Further, he has not established that the appeal decision involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law. Consequently, the Commission rejects complainant's claim for additional damages related to his tax liability.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. Postmaster General,</span> 0120080118 (2008); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0420060035 (2007) (remanding for additional proof of tax liability where complainant submitted only his own subjective calculations).</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072120 (2010), made an original argument regarding tax consequences, but one that ultimately did not succeed. The agency issued a lump sum back pay award to the complainant for some nine years of back pay in 2007. It also awarded the complainant, as part of the compensatory damages award, an amount of slightly over $37,000 for the additional tax liability the complainant had in 2007 as a result of the lump sum payment. The damage award for tax liability, however, was paid in 2008. The complainant then requested an additional award of damages to account for the increased tax liability in 2008. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, declined the complainant's request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that, under both legal and equitable theories, <span id="Page_1748"></span>an award to cover additional tax liability from a lump sum payment of back pay is available to complainants. <span class="Italic">Van Hoose v. Department of Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982628 and 01990455 (August 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Goetze v. Department of Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (August 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Holler v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01982627 and 01990407 (August 22, 2001). In the case of a lump sum back pay award, individuals are compensated for the extra tax they are required to pay as a result of receiving a lump sum award, as opposed to the actual amount they would have to pay if they had received the pay over a period of time, usually several years. It is the receipt of the pay in one lump sum that causes the extra tax liability, not the back pay award itself. In the case of compensatory damages and interest, there is no option to receive partial payments over time. The AJ only awarded adverse tax consequences for the "lump-sum wage payment" and that is what the agency paid complainant. We find that complainant is entitled to a tax offset payment for 2007, the tax year in which she received a lump sum payment for back pay. The record reveals the agency paid complainant $37,691.00 in 2008 for the adverse tax consequences from the 2007 lump-sum wage payment. We agree with the agency that complainant is not entitled by the AJ's decision to an award for adverse tax consequences based upon the adverse tax consequence award. Such a situation would, as the agency suggests, be endless; also, it is simply not part of the AJ's relief. Furthermore, we find complainant failed to meet her burden of demonstrating a tax burden additional to the $37,691.00 complainant received caused by the lump sum back pay award she received in 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Stefan H. v. Attorney General</span>, 0420150008 (2016), the Commission appears to have accepted the very argument it rejected in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>. In <span class="Italic">Stefan H.,</span> the agency was ordered to pay the complainant nearly $23,000 in damages for tax liability, which the agency did, but the agency then issued a Form 1099 the following year to complainant for that amount and reported the payment to IRS. That led IRS to determine not only that the complainant owed taxes, but also penalties and interest. The complainant, through documentation submitted by his accountant, requested the $8,945 in additional tax liability as well as an additional amount, referred to as "grossing up," to account for future taxes. The Commission approved the complainant's request.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ulloa v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420080001 (2008), the Commission approved a $5,172 payment to the complainant to compensate her for increased taxes as the result of a lump sum back pay award, as well as $500 for the services of a certified public accountant to calculate the tax liability. However, the Commission declined to award almost $7,000 the complainant claimed in interest and penalties because she did not present evidence that the interest and penalties were actually assessed or paid. However, in <span class="Italic">Ulloa v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420080023 (2008), the Commission ordered the agency pay the interest and penalties where the complainant asserted that she had in fact supplied the documentation with her enforcement petition, the Commission must have misplaced that documentation, and the agency did not dispute the complainant's contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080027 (2008), the Commission upheld an award of $6,000 in pecuniary damages to compensate the complainant for tax penalties from early withdrawals from her thrift savings fund to cover living expenses after a discriminatory termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award to compensate a complainant for the tax consequences of a lump sum back pay award is not an element of compensatory damages, but equitable relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kloock v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/04A40012.txt">04A40012</a> (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on the <span class="Italic">O'Neill</span> case, the Commission has also held that an agency's liability for the tax consequences of receiving a back pay award all in one year applies under the ADEA. In <span class="Italic">Bermea v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 07A20099 (2003), the Commission remanded the case to the administrative judge for a determination of the amount of the agency's liability for the increase in taxes. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Smets v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a45224.txt">01A45224</a> (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency is liable for the tax consequences of a back pay award spanning more than one tax year, if the complainant believes there has been an error in calculating withholdings, that is a dispute that must be taken up with the Internal Revenue Service. <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 04A30030 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984091 (2001), the Commission found the agency was liable for state taxes paid to North Carolina where the complainant was discriminatorily denied a transfer to Texas--a state with no income tax. However, the Commission noted that the payment of income tax to North Carolina may have resulted in reducing the complainant's federal taxes and, if so, the agency was entitled to offset any reduction in federal taxes against the North Carolina taxes the complainant paid. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Phillipp v. Secretary of</span> <span class="Italic"> Energy</span>, 0120073414 (2010) (complainant must actually prove increased state tax liability).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to have a viable claim for reimbursement of state taxes paid, the complainant must present specific evidence that the proximate cause of having to pay taxes was the agency's discrimination and specific evidence of the actual amount of taxes paid and the difference the complainant claims. For example, in <span class="Italic">Steenson v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A13535 (2003), the Commission found that the complainant had not prevailed on his claim that the agency's refusal to hire him resulted in his paying state taxes to Arkansas where the job he was denied was in Wyoming. The Commission did not rule that the complainant was not entitled to such damages as a matter of law, but that his proof was not sufficiently specific on the issue. Although the Commission noted that the complainant was correct in his assertion that Wyoming did not have an income tax, it held in <span class="Italic">Steenson</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that he is entitled to reimbursement for the income tax he was required to pay on his salary as a resident of Arkansas. Complainant contends that he would not have incurred this tax liability, but for the agency's discriminatory non-selection, because Wyoming does not have a state income tax. The agency, in response, argues that complainant is not entitled to this amount because: 1) he has not adduced evidence demonstrating that his overall tax liability would have been less, when items such as property tax or sales tax are considered; and 2) "there is no legal basis to conclude that the complainant's tax liability in Arkansas was proximately caused by" the discriminatory non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency that complainant has not adduced evidence demonstrating that he was required to pay higher amounts in taxes due to the agency's discrimination. We note that an individual's tax liability includes a number of factors, including sales, property and excise taxes, and that various state taxes may also be deductible on federal tax returns. While the State of Wyoming does not have a state income tax, complainant has not submitted evidence establishing with the requisite certainty his claim that he in fact incurred a higher tax burden<span class="Italic">. See Guidance</span>,<span class="Italic"> id.</span> ("Compensatory damages 'may be had for any proximate consequences which can be established with requisite certainty.' 22 Am Jur 2d Damages &#x00A7; 45 (1965)."). Complainant's bare assertion regarding the fact that the State of Wyoming does not have a state income tax is insufficient to establish the extent, nature, and severity of the claimed harm or to otherwise "establish[ ] with requisite certainty" that the agency's discrimination "had...any proximate consequences" with respect to complainant's tax liability<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
