<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-30_1"><span class="space">2.</span> Adverse Inference</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has long used an adverse inference as a sanction for inadequate investigations. For example, in <span class="Italic">McDuffie v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05880134 (1988), the Commission found that an adverse inference could be drawn from the failure of the agency to include relevant statistical information in the investigation report, even though the employee raised the issue of disparate treatment and never raised the issue that blacks were underrepresented in the work force. Under the Commission's guidance in MD-110, however, the administrative judge must first give the agency the opportunity to provide the missing information prior to issuing sanctions. "It is now firmly established that where an agency is aware of the importance of requested evidence and has exclusive control over such evidence, yet fails to provide it, an inference that the requested evidence is unfavorable to the agency may be drawn." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Trans World Airlines</span>, 32 FEP 857, 881-82 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, sanctions may be imposed against an agency for failure to produce necessary and relevant evidence during the investigation, particularly when the investigator cautions the agency that failure to produce the information may result in sanctions. For example, in <span class="Italic">McDaniel v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120070869 (2008), the Commission imposed an adverse inference against the agency in a nonselection case where the complainant contended that she was better qualified than the selectee and the agency did not produce the applications of the complainant and the selectee, the certificate of eligibles, or any notes taken by the selecting official. In finding that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the complainant, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">McDaniel</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Report of Investigation reflects that in a letter dated March 15, 2006, the investigator informed the agency that certain documentation was required and the failure to produce such documentation could result in an adverse inference or sanctions by the Commission. In a separate letter, dated September 7, 2006, the investigator again requested the agency to produce relevant documentary evidence in this case. Specifically, the investigator requested that the agency produce, among other things, the applications of complainant and the selectee and any relevant documentation such as the certificate of eligible candidates and any notes taken by the selecting official for inclusion in the record. The record reflects, however, that the agency failed to do respond or produce any of the requested documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the aforesaid evidence is relevant to the issues in this case since complainant argues that her qualifications are superior to those of the selectee. Specifically, complainant stated in her affidavit that she had more working Budget knowledge and experience than the selectee since she was a "VISN Budget Analyst for approximately 3 years, was a Fiscal Officer for approximately one year and an Assistant Fiscal Officer for 4 years." Complainant also stated that she had "over 15 years experience in the VA fiscal arena" and was performing some of the duties of the GS-13 Budget Analyst position at. the time the previous Budget Analyst retired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without the candidates' applications and any relevant notes or other documentation from the selection process, it is impossible to determine whether complainant established that her qualifications are superior. <span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods, inc</span>., 546 U.S. 454 (2006). The Commission's regulations require an employee of a. federal agency to produce documentary and testimonial evidence as the investigator deems necessary. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(1). Where an agency fails without good cause to respond fully and in a timely fashion to requests for documentation, records, or comparative data, and where the investigator properly advised the party that a failure to comply with the request could result in an adverse inference or sanctions, the Commission on appeal may draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the information. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3)(i); EEO MD-110 at 6-23. The Commission may also consider the matters to which the requested information pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as a result of the agency's failure to respond to the investigator's requests, the Commission sanctions the agency by drawing an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the agency.</p>

It is worth noting that although administrative judges are required to give notice and an opportunity to respond before imposing sanctions, OFO on appeal apparently is not required to do. There is no indication of notice or an opportunity to respond in either <span class="Italic">McDaniel</span> or <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An adverse inference was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Olivas v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A04026 (2002), where the selecting official and his supervisor refused to give sworn statements to the investigator and the only evidence of a legitimate reason was in the form of statements they made to the EEO counselor. In addition, the agency failed to produce all of the files of the selectees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission implied that the adverse inference rule should not be applied where an agency's failure to produce evidence does not adversely affect the appellant's ability to present his case. In <span class="Italic">Sharpe v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01953138 (1997), the Commission found the agency's failure to produce certain statements of a selecting official would not be adversely construed because it was unlikely that they were material, and the statements may have been made in an attempt to settle the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's recommended decision also addressed appellant's motion for an adverse inference against the agency. In denying the motion, the AJ found that the agency's failure to preserve certain documents related to the promotion at issue did not preclude appellant from presenting his case, and there was no evidence of intentional delay in processing appellant's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In post-hearing argument, appellant added that an adverse inference should be drawn against the agency for failing to provide statements the selecting official made in 1990. The statements were given to an agency official who served as the managerial designee in a process designed to resolve appellant's complaint. The selecting official testified that she did not have the statements, and they "ha[d] to be" close to what she subsequently wrote (apparently referring to her 1991 EEO investigative affidavit, which included a discussion of the selectee's qualifications).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In discovery, appellant asked for all documents related to the evaluation of the qualifications of any candidate in the selection process. Nevertheless, given the above circumstances, the Commission declines to draw an adverse inference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission declines to remand the complaint to the agency for provision of the 1990 statements or an explanation of why they were not provided. The report of what the selecting official told the EEO counselor, and the selecting official's affidavit and testimony are substantially consistent. It is unlikely the statements, made after appellant filed his complaint, would provide additional illumination. Further, if the statements were made pursuant to the resolution process, the agency could properly object to their admission on the grounds that admitting them would chill the settlement process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of its brevity, the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Sharpe</span> is somewhat unclear. However, it appears the Commission could be infusing the harmful error rule into its adverse inference determinations--something which would undermine the reason for having an adverse inference. Indeed, if the complainant's request is for relevant information, then the agency's failure to produce the information results in an adverse inference because it is presumed the agency has declined to provide it in order to protect itself from the harmful effects of the information. Requiring, under <span class="Italic">Sharpe</span>, that the complainant demonstrate that the unproduced evidence would likely lead to a different result simply stands the adverse inference rule on its head. The Commission's observation that the requested statements may have been made in settlement negotiations and, therefore, were privileged has far more validity as a grounds for not imposing the adverse inference rule. Still, the Commission should have required some actual proof that the statements were in fact made in settlement negotiations prior to deeming them privileged.</p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Bayda v. Attorney General, INS</span>, 01955738 (1997), the Commission gave no hint of raising a harmful error rule in drawing an adverse inference against the agency for failing to provide information on comparables in a supplemental investigation, observing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented is whether appellant proved that she was discriminated against because of sex (female), reprisal (prior EEO <span id="Page_311"></span>activity), national origin (Egyptian) and age (40+) when: (1) younger, male Immigration Inspectors were given favorable work assignments on the Terrorist, Drug and Fraud (TDF) Team, as well as overtime; and (2) she was harassed by agency officials because of her EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency conducted the supplemental investigation but was unable to gather the information and documentation we ordered. The agency issued a new FAD, stating that "the documents the EEOC ordered to be added to the investigative file, including performance appraisals and work assignments, are no longer available because the were required, in accordance with personnel regulations, to be retained for only three years. While performance appraisals and work schedules for complainant and her co-workers would have made the investigative file more complete, and could have been helpful in analyzing complainant's claims of discrimination, they were destroyed as a matter of routine, and are no longer available." The agency, again, found no discrimination, basing its decision on the information and documentation in the original investigative report, and asserting that there was sufficient information in that record to support its conclusion. It is from this decision that appellant now appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our prior decision in this matter, contrary to the agency's present assertion, found the original investigation significantly deficient. Had we agreed with the agency that the information and documentation requested "could have been helpful" but there was sufficient information presented in the report to support its conclusion, the Commission would not have vacated the original FAD and remanded the complaint. With none of the information and documentation requested in our order available, the report we previously found deficient remains so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Basic to EEO law are the concepts of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and disparate treatment. Essential to appellant's claim of discrimination is the identification of similarly situated employees and the comparison evidence demonstrating whether or not these employees were treated more favorably under similar circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Sanhueza v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01911109 (May 21, 1991); <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910490 (July 23, 1991). Equally basic is the second tier of the three-tier <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> paradigm requiring the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions once appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The information the Commission requested was critical to the analysis of these factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulations [29 CFR 1614.108(c)(3)] provide that the Commission may draw an adverse inference against an agency in all matters where evidence requested as part of a supplemental investigation is not provided. <span class="Italic">See Lebron v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943052 January 19, 1996); <span class="Italic">Scura v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943381 (July 20, 1995). The agency argues that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The investigative file indicates that efforts were made, including interviews with more than thirty Miami management officials and co-workers, to gather the relevant information needed to address complaint's claims. In light of the nature of complainant's claims, it is understandable that the performance appraisals of complaint's co-workers and work assignment rosters, which may not have been the most obvious information needed to address complainant's claim, were not part of the original investigative file. In addition, the documents were discarded only after the required retention period, most likely by people who had no knowledge of the potential relevance of the documents to complainant's claim, so there is no reason to draw an adverse inference that the documents would have reflected unfavorably on the INS. (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FAD, page 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission disagrees and finds that it is appropriate to draw an adverse inference from the agency's failure to produce the requested information and documentation in this case. We have long held that in order to be considered similarly situated, comparative employees, among other things, must have the same supervisors, perform the same job function on the same tour and have been subjected to the alleged discriminatory act during the same time period. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900539 (June 15, 1990); <span class="Italic">Kalivretenos v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890884 (October 13, 1989); <span class="Italic">Prichard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880261 (July 19, 1988); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880091 (June 22, 1988); <span class="Italic">Wright v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870622 (May 6, 1988). Comparative information and documentation regarding the structure of its Miami facility, management's chain of command, supervisory assignments and tour and unit assignments, is more than just "helpful" but, rather, goes to the fundamental analysis and establishment of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the agency concedes that younger, male employees were assigned to the TDF team with its employment advantages, but articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the assignments, as those employees performed their duties better than appellant. The requested performance appraisals and ratings of appellant and the comparative employees go to the heart of the agency's articulated reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant filed her complaint on April 30, 1990, the agency acknowledged its receipt on May 22, 1990, and issued its letter of acceptance on December 27, 1990. Clearly, the agency was on notice of appellant's allegations and the above information and documentation was available to the agency during the initial formal investigation. We reject the agency's notion that the performance appraisals and work assignment rosters "may not have been the most obvious information needed to address complainant's claim." We find that it was obvious and essential information which the agency had in its possession and did not produce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the agency's attempt to abdicate its responsibility by placing the blame for discarding the information on unnamed agency employees who most likely "had no knowledge of the potential relevance of the documents." Accordingly, the Commission draws an adverse inference from the agency's failure to produce essential information and concludes that had it been produced, it would have reflected unfavorably on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to drawing an adverse inference, we find that the record, as a whole, supports a finding of age and gender discrimination. The initial investigation indicated that twenty four of thirty six co-workers interviewed agreed with the agency's admission that younger males were given preferential treatment, and a significant number of those employees agreed with appellant's assertion that it was motivated by discrimination. Accordingly, we find that appellant met her burden of proving age and gender discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the end, it may be that <span class="Italic">Sharpe</span> simply stands for the proposition that a complainant must demonstrate that the evidence the agency refuses to submit is relevant and probative to the issues in dispute, rather than the proposition that the complainant must show the documents would likely change the outcome of the hearing. Infusing a harmful error analysis into the determination of whether to draw an adverse inference makes no sense; drawing an inference only in those cases where the evidence is relevant and probative does. For example, in <span class="Italic">Barela v. Secretary of State</span>, 01965017 (1997), the Commission drew an adverse inference against the agency without any discussion of the complainant showing how the destroyed evidence would have altered the outcome of the case. Instead, the Commission focused on the destruction of the evidence and the agency's failure to provide sufficient justification for not retaining the evidence.</p>
