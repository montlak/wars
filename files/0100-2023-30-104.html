<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-101"><span id="Page_1795"></span><span class="space">3.</span> Future Pecuniary Damages</h4>
<p class="noindent">Future pecuniary damages refer to those out-of-pocket costs that a complainant is likely to incur, after resolution of a complaint, as a result of the discrimination. The most obvious future pecuniary damages are expenses for continued medical treatment and medication. However, an award of future pecuniary damages can also be made for the loss of future earning potential. Such awards are rare and must be distinguished from front pay awards, discussed above, which are part of the traditional "make whole" relief. Future pecuniary damage awards for loss of earning potential are addressed in more detail below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-30-119.html#sec21-116">Pecuniary Damage Award Standards</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Future pecuniary damages are speculative by nature. However, the Commission does attempt to eliminate speculation to the degree possible in awarding future pecuniary damages. Generally, the Commission requires specific evidence regarding the medical prognosis for the complainant's projected course of treatment. Vague allegations of continued treatment are insufficient to support claims for future pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no presumption that emotional distress has ended merely because the discrimination has ceased or the complainant has departed from the workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01971729 (1999). However, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01943844 (1996), the Commission held that a complainant must provide evidence of the nature, extent, and duration of future medical visits. In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the only documentation provided was a letter from a doctor stating that "if things remain as they are, [appellant] will need to be in therapy for an undetermined amount of time." The Commission found this was insufficient for an award of future pecuniary damages. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Wallis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950510 (1995), the Commission awarded future pecuniary damages based on a letter from the employee's physician stating that the employee would need continued medical treatment for the next five years.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where there is a preexisting medical condition, the Commission will attempt to determine the additional monetary amount that the employee will be required to spend because of the discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Androvich v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01950531 (1996), the employee submitted statements indicating that she would need 30 months of treatment at a cost of $32,000. The Commission found that the agency's actions were responsible for 25% of the employee's injury. Accordingly, the Commission awarded $8,000 in future pecuniary damages for psychotherapy. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A33904 (2003), the Commission awarded $5,000 for future psychiatric treatment where the complainant had a preexisting condition and his psychiatrist projected another $10,000 in treatment over a two-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01955684 (1998), the Commission awarded future pecuniary damages based on the following evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a February 26, 1995 evaluation report, appellant's psychologist wrote that since appellant's progress had been slow, her visits would be increased to twice weekly. In a July 31, 1995 progress report, the psychologist stated that he had been seeing appellant on a biweekly basis. A brief from appellant's attorney received by the Commission in August 1995 stated that appellant continued to see her psychologist twice a week. As recently as March 27, 1996, appellant's attorney submitted a letter to the Commission stating that appellant was still in treatment with her psychologist. Given that the most recent documentation by the psychologist in the record is the progress report of July 31, 1995, and there is no statement from the psychologist estimating how long treatment was expected to continue, there is insufficient evidence to make an estimate beyond the attorney's March 27, 1996 letter concerning how long appellant's treatment will continue, and hence future pecuniary damages for such treatment will not be awarded beyond that date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The period between November 24, 1994 and February 26, 1995 is approximately 13 weeks. The period between February 27, 1995 and March 27, 1996 is approximately 56 weeks. The total regularly scheduled visits during the first period would be 13 (once a week), and the total regularly scheduled visits during the second period would be 112 (twice a week). Given that appellant did not actually see her psychologist each week in the past, and some visits will typically be missed, we estimate that appellant would have had 110 visits during this time period. At a rate of $150 per visit, appellant's future pecuniary damages total $16,800.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCann v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01971851 (1998), the complainant's psychiatrist wrote that the complainant would require long-term care for a period of three to five years, including weekly medical visits and daily medication. Noting the complainant's history of one psychiatric visit per month, the Commission awarded the costs of the additional three office visits per month for a three-year period. The Commission also awarded the costs of all of the complainant's medication for a three-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although there is a degree of speculation inherent in awarding future pecuniary damages, that speculation comes in the form of determining precisely how long the complainant will continue to need medical treatment and not whether the complainant will continue to need medical treatment. In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01997262 (2002), the Commission declined to increase an award of future pecuniary damages for future medical treatment because the evidence was too speculative on the complainant's need for treatment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to complainant's claim for future medical expenses, we note that her total claim is for $516,329 and that, as noted above, future medical expenses are subject to the statutory cap of $300,000. Complainant was previously awarded $40,000 in non-pecuniary damages. The limit she can receive in future pecuniary damages is therefore $260,000<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 U.S.C. 1981a(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant provided letters from her treating physicians indicating the expenses she would incur in the future for treatment of injuries. Complainant's primary treating physician (P1) indicated that complainant would need various treatment for life due to her spine degeneration, neck and back pain, including: two appointments each year with P1, at a cost of $80.00 per visit; physical therapy three times a week at $90 per visit; $800 a year in medications; and a visit to the neurologist once a year at $150.00. P1 also indicated that complainant's back and neck problems prevented her from being employed. Complainant therefore argued that she would need these expenses paid up until she was 65 years old and qualifies for Medicare, or 24 years from the time of the request. The total future medical expenses estimated by P1 are, therefore, $3,840,00 for treatment by P1, $311,040 for physical therapy, $3,600 for visits to a neurologist, and $19,200 in medication, for a total of $337,680.00</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also provided an estimate from her mental health physician (P2) who indicated that she had only seen complainant once, but roughly estimated that complainant would need five years of weekly therapy at $80 a week, for a total of $19,200.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, complainant provided a note from her neurologist (P3), who provided an estimate of medical costs complainant would incur in the future. He estimated the following: three visits per year to the neurologist at $170 a visit; $8,000 for the use of a hot tub; a one month course of physical therapy 4 times a year at $1,000 each course; use of a health club at $50.00 per month; and medications at $2,000 a year. Complainant again noted that she would incur these expenses until she was 65 years old. The total estimates she claimed based on P3's note are: $12,240 for neurological visits, $8,000 for purchase of a hot tub; $96,000 for physical therapy; $14,400 for use of a health club; and $48,000 for medications, for a total of $178,640.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that complainant's claim for future medical expenses beyond that which the agency has already awarded is not supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning first to P1's estimate, we note that although P1 indicated that complainant would need to receive, for the rest of her life, medical treatment from him, as well as a physical therapist, and a neurologist, he provided an insufficient explanation for why treatment would be needed for such a duration. Moreover, P1 failed to indicate the nature or extent of treatment complainant would receive during her various appointments. Instead, P1 simply noted that complainant would need to attend these appointments for the rest of her life, providing no explanation for why he previously testified that complainant would need only limited future treatment. We find, therefore, that P1's estimate for complainant's future medical expenses for treatment from P1, a physical therapist, and a neurologist, is not supported by the record<span class="Italic">. See Sinnot v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952872 (September 19, 1996) (denied claim for future medical expenses where complainant failed to provide sufficient documentation from a doctor as to the nature, extent or duration of future therapy).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we note that P3 makes no estimate of the expected duration of the treatment he recommends, but instead merely lists various costs with little or no explanation. Complainant apparently relied on P1's statement that complainant would need the treatment P1 suggested for the remainder of her life in coming to the $178,640.00 estimate she gives for P3's treatment plan. There is no indication that P3 believed the therapy he recommended would be needed for the duration of complainant's life. Although the record contains letters from P3 describing complainant's condition throughout 1994 and recommending treatment, these letters do not contain estimates of future medical costs, nor an estimate on how long complainant will require therapy. Accordingly, as P3's statement contains no indication for the expected duration for the treatment, we find that the FAD properly disallowed damages for these expenses<span class="Italic">. See</span> S<span class="Italic">innot,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's claim for future medical expenses for the cost of medication is also without sufficient support in the record. Although P1 and P3 estimated that complainant would need medication at a cost of $800 a year and $2,000 a year, respectively, they did not specify what medications to which they were referring. We therefore have no way to determine if these costs are redundant. Moreover, although other medical documentation in the record indicates that complainant's doctors had prescribed medications for her in the past, there is no indication as to the cost of these medications, nor whether these medications are the same as those P1 and P3 advised for future treatment. Based on a thorough <span id="Page_1796"></span>review of the record, we find complainant produced insufficient evidence in support of her claimed future medical expenses for the cost of medication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, turning to complainant's request for future medical expenses for mental health treatment, we agree with the agency that complainant's claim for five years of treatment is not supported by the record. It is undisputed that P2 only met with complainant once before providing her estimate, and indicated that she was "going out on a limb" in terms of estimating how many years of therapy would be necessary. Although complainant's former mental health therapist testified at the hearing that complainant would need additional therapy, there is no evidence in the record to support a future medical expenses award for five years of such therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Burton v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0720050066 (2007), where an award of future pecuniary damages for loss of future earning capacity was set aside for lack of medical evidence on the likely duration of the complainant's medical conditions or the period during which she would suffer from diminished earning capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent">A mere statement that the complainant will require further treatment without an explanation of the treatment itself and the basis of the treatment is not sufficient to establish entitlement to future pecuniary damages. In <span class="Italic">Aponte v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120063532 (2008), the Commission denied the complainant's request for future medical treatment where the health care provider simply stated that the complainant would need four more years of treatment at four visits per year. The statement failed to give any basis for that opinion. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sorg v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0720060065 (2008) (statement from physician that complainant would need future treatment indefinitely insufficient to support award of future pecuniary damages).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cook v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02390 (2001), found that the complainant was entitled to damages for loss of earning capacity. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cook</span> explained the difference between front pay and loss of earning capacity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that complainant is entitled to an award for her loss of earning capacity which resulted from the agency's discrimination. In its FAD, the agency mistakenly concluded that because our prior decision found that complainant was not entitled to front pay, she was not therefore entitled to an award for loss of earning capacity. In our prior decision, we concluded that complainant was not entitled to the equitable relief of front pay which is different from the pecuniary damage of loss of earning capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated, front pay is an equitable remedy that compensates an individual when reinstatement is not possible in certain limited circumstances. The Commission has identified three circumstances where front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement: (1) where no position is available; (2) where a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic; or (3) where the employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts<span class="Italic">. See Cook v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950027 (July 17, 1998). The fact that front pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement implies that the complainant is able to work but cannot do so because of circumstances external to the complainant<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, lost earning capacity represents a loss in one's future earning power and is distinct from the issue of front pay. That is, an award for the loss of future earning capacity considers the effect that complainant's injury will have on her ability in the future to earn a salary comparable with what she earned before the injury<span class="Italic">. Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995); <span class="Italic">McKnight v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 973 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Pharmacia Inc.</span>, 956 F. Supp. 1457, 1467 (N.D. Ind. 1996). An award of damages for lost earning capacity comports with Title VII's goal of providing make-whole relief to the victims of discrimination<span class="Italic">. Williams</span>, 956 F. Supp. at 1466 (<span class="Italic">citing Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 417-19 (1975)). The Commission previously has awarded future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity<span class="Italic">. See Brinkley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980429 (August 12, 1999); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that the individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to her<span class="Italic">. Carpenter, supra</span>. Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence which demonstrates with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the loss has been sustained<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> (citing Annotation, Evidence of Impaired Earnings Capacity, 18 A.L.R.3d 88, 92 (1968)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our prior decision, we found that the evidence overwhelmingly established that complainant could never return to work for the agency or anywhere else. Complainant's physician opined that as result of the agency's discrimination, complainant suffered an irreparable harm which rendered her disabled. In light of the evidence, we find that complainant has suffered a loss in her future earning capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a remedy, we order the agency to calculate the loss by computing the amount complainant would have earned if she had remained employed by the agency until retirement. As in the case of a back pay award, however to avoid double recovery, the amount of future pecuniary damages paid must be offset by any wage-replacement benefit which would be excluded from a back pay award<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805. In determining complainant's salary level, the calculation should include complainant's wages, agency contributions to health benefits and life insurance premiums, and agency contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System, and the Thrift Savings Plan.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Finlay, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. While generally the standard retirement age is 65 years old, the agency shall use the appropriate retirement age as defined by the agency's and Office of Personnel Management's rules. In addition, we note that under Title VII, the sum of the amount of compensatory damages awarded for future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses shall not exceed $300,000 for an employer the size of the agency. 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981A(b)(3). Therefore, since our prior decision awarded complainant $130,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages, complainant's award for future pecuniary losses cannot exceed $170,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kuepfer v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A31297 (2003) (finding that front pay was not appropriate where a fitness-for-duty examination determined that the complainant was unable to work, but remanding the case for additional evidence on any loss of earning capacity as future pecuniary damages).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Moore v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720050084 (2007), the Commission remanded the case for a determination on loss of future earning capacity damages not to exceed $180,000 where it also approved an award of $120,000 in compensatory damages. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, was discriminated against on the basis of his race and in reprisal for protected activity when the agency refused to give him assistance loading and unloading his truck. As a result, the complainant, who was a tractor trailer operator, suffered a rotator cuff injury that had precluded him from working for four years at the time of the decision. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, set aside the administrative judge's decision awarding front pay in lieu of the loss of earning capacity award finding that damages and not equitable relief was the appropriate remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We observe that the AJ issued an award of front pay. The Commission has held that front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement when: (1) no position is available; (2) a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic; or (3) the employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts. <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980429 (August 12, 1999) (citation omitted). The Commission finds that an award based on complainant's loss of future earning capacity is a more appropriate remedy in the instant matter. Where complainant has shown that his future earning power has been diminished as result of the agency's discrimination, the Commission has awarded future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity. <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30005 (July 16, 2004) (describing the remedy as an award of "future pecuniary damages"); <span class="Italic">Brinkley,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980429. Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that an individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to him. <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30005 (<span class="Italic">quoting Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995)). Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence which demonstrates "that the impairment of earning capacity 'be shown with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability and there must evidence which will permit the [fact finder] to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">quoting Carpenter,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (citations omitted) (brackets original)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that despite two surgeries, complainant continues to suffer substantial pain and his shoulder has not been sufficiently stabilized to allow his surgeon to perform surgery to treat the torn rotator cuff. The orthopedist has not expressed optimism as to complainant's prognosis. The orthopedist indicated that complainant was in the most difficult treatment category and the point was nearing where complainant should have improved and if he did not improve, he would call it quits and tell complainant he will have to learn to live with the condition. The orthopedist testified that it did not appear that complainant would ever return to his job as a Tractor Trailer Operator. The orthopedist further stated that complainant will probably not be able to do heavy lifting in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that the agency's discrimination caused complainant's injury and that he could not, at least for some period of time, come back to work in his position as Tractor Trailer Operator. The Commission agrees that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that complainant desired to continue working until his normal retirement date at age 65. We note that the agency has not argued that the AJ miscalculated the retirement <span id="Page_1797"></span>date. The AJ found that complainant would be 65 years old on June 26, 2006. The AJ awarded front pay for 24 months (until June 30, 2007), because the AJ found that while it was "18 months short of complainant's normal retirement date, it is too speculative to presume that complainant will not work again in any capacity." The AJ stated that 24 months of front pay is sufficient to allow complainant to train for and secure some other type of employment that is compatible with his current and projected physical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a remedy, we order the agency to calculate complainant's loss of future earning capacity by computing the amount complainant would have earned, plus benefits, if he had remained employed by the agency from August 3, 2005 through August 2, 2007. The amount of $5,069 per month that was awarded in back pay should be adjusted to reflect the pay increases complainant would have received since his injury and the overtime rates should reflect the new pay rates. Any future pecuniary damages paid to complainant must be offset by the amount of any wage replacement benefits he received from the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP), any fringe benefits which have been continued under OWCP and any wages he earned working in any position following vocational training for a period of two years from the date of the agency's final order. Under Title VII, awards for loss of future earning capacity are subject to the statutory cap for compensatory damages--in this case $300,000.00. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D). Since complainant was previously awarded $120,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages, complainant's award for future pecuniary losses can not exceed $180,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">When future pecuniary damages are awarded for loss of future income it is appropriate to deduct benefits that the complainant is receiving, such as disability retirement benefits, from the amount of the award. <span class="Italic">Lovett v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120102682 (2011).</p>
