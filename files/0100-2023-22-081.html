<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-81"><span class="space">B.</span> DEFINITION</h3>
<p class="noindent">For the most part, religious beliefs are easy to recognize. They are, most often, <span id="Page_1044"></span>tied to a well-established denomination or sect. This is not always the case, however, so 29 CFR 1605.1 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In most cases whether or not a practice or belief is religious is not at issue. However, in those cases in which the issue does exist, the Commission will define religious practices to include moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views. This standard was developed in <span class="Italic">United States v. Seeger</span>, 380 U.S. 163 (1965) and <span class="Italic">Welsh v. United States</span>, 398 U.S. 333 (1970). The Commission has consistently applied this standard in its decisions. The fact that no religious group espouses such beliefs or the fact that the religious group to which the individual professes to belong may not accept such belief will not determine whether the belief is a religious belief of the employee or prospective employee. The phrase "religious practice" as used in these Guidelines includes both religious observances and practices, as stated in Section 701(j), 42 USC 2000e(j).</p>
<p class="noindent">The emphasis is on the nature and strength of the beliefs and not on whether the belief is adhered to by any organized religious group. "A religion is a set of attitudes, beliefs or practices which permeate an individual's life. Religion is not to be invoked arbitrarily or at the convenience of the individual. 'A religious belief functions as a religion in the <span class="Italic">life</span> of the individual.'" <span class="Italic">Samuels v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01850301 (1987) (quoting <span class="Italic">Welsh v. United States</span>, 398 U.S. 333 (1970) (no finding of sincere belief where none of the employee's previous complaints made any reference to religious grounds)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Compliance Manual, at Section 12-I,A,1, elaborates on the definition of religion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII defines "religion" to include "all aspects of religious observance and practice as well as belief," not just practices that are mandated or prohibited by a tenet of the individual's faith. Religion includes not only traditional, organized religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, but also religious beliefs that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or sect, only subscribed to by a small number of people, or that seem illogical or unreasonable to others. Further, a person's religious beliefs "need not be confined in either source or content to traditional or parochial concepts of religion." A belief is "religious" for Title VII purposes if it is "religious" in the person's "own scheme of things," i.e., it is a "sincere and meaningful" belief that "occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by...God." The Supreme Court has made it clear that it is not a court's role to determine the reasonableness of an individual's religious beliefs, and that "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection." An employee's belief, observance, or practice can be "religious" under Title VII even if the employee is affiliated with a religious group that does not espouse or recognize that individual's belief, observance, or practice, or if few--or no--other people adhere to it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs as well as non-theistic "moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views." Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns "ultimate ideas" about "life, purpose, and death."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have looked for certain features to determine if an individual's beliefs can be considered religious. As one court explained: "'First, a religion addresses fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters. Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching. Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Social, political, or economic philosophies, as well as mere personal preferences, are not religious beliefs protected by Title VII. However, overlap between a religious and political view does not place it outside the scope of Title VII's religion protections, as long as that view is part of a comprehensive religious belief system and is not simply an "isolated teaching." Religious observances or practices include, for example, attending worship services, praying, wearing religious garb or symbols, displaying religious objects, adhering to certain dietary rules, proselytizing or other forms of religious expression, and refraining from certain activities. Determining whether a practice is religious turns not on the nature of the activity, but on the employee's motivation. The same practice might be engaged in by one person for religious reasons and by another person for purely secular reasons. Whether the practice is religious is therefore a situational, case-by-case inquiry, focusing not on what the activity is but on whether the employee's participation in the activity is pursuant to a religious belief. For example, one employee might observe certain dietary restrictions for religious reasons while another employee adheres to the very same dietary restrictions but for secular (e.g., health or environmental) reasons. In that instance, the same practice in one case might be subject to reasonable accommodation under Title VII because an employee engages in the practice for religious reasons, and in another case might not be subject to reasonable accommodation because the practice is engaged in for secular reasons. However, EEOC and courts must exercise a "light touch" in making this determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following examples illustrate these concepts:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 1--Employment Decisions Based on "Religion"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An otherwise qualified applicant is not hired because he is a self-described evangelical Christian. A qualified non-Jewish employee is denied promotion because the supervisor wishes to give a preference based on religion to a fellow Jewish employee. An employer terminates an employee based on his disclosure to the employer that he has recently converted to the Baha'i Faith. Each of these is an example of an employment decision based on the religious belief or practice of the applicant or employee, and therefore is discrimination based on "religion" within the meaning of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 2--Religious Practice versus Secular Practice</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A Seventh-day Adventist employee follows a vegetarian diet because she believes it is religiously prescribed by scripture. Her vegetarianism is a religious practice, even though not all Seventh-day Adventists share this belief or follow this practice, and even though many individuals adhere to a vegetarian diet for purely secular reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 3--Types of Religious Practice or Observance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A Catholic employee requests a schedule change so that he can attend a church service on Good Friday. A Muslim employee requests an exception to the company's dress and grooming code allowing her to wear her headscarf, or a Hindu employee requests an exception allowing her to wear her bindi (religious forehead marking). An employee asks to be excused from the religious invocation offered at the beginning of staff meetings because he objects on religious grounds or does not ascribe to the religious sentiments expressed. An adherent to Native American spiritual beliefs seeks unpaid leave to attend a ritual ceremony. An employee who identifies as Christian but is not affiliated with a particular sect or denomination requests accommodation of his religious belief that working on his Sabbath is prohibited. Each of these requests relates to a "religious" belief, observance, or practice within the meaning of Title VII. The question of whether the employer is required to grant these requests is discussed in the section below addressing religious accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 4--Supervisor Considers Belief Illogical</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Morgan asks for time off on October 31 to attend the "Samhain Sabbat," the New Year observance of Wicca, her religion. Her supervisor refuses, saying that Wicca is not a "real" religion but an "illogical conglomeration" of "various aspects of the occult, such as faith healing, self hypnosis, tarot card reading, and spell casting, which are not religious practices." The supervisor's refusal to accommodate her on the ground that he believes her religion is illogical or not a "real religion" violates Title VII unless the employer can show her request would impose an undue hardship. The law applies to religious beliefs even though others may find them "incorrect" or "incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 5--Unique Belief Can Be Religious</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Edward practices the Kemetic religion, based on ancient Egyptian faith, and affiliates himself with a tribe numbering fewer than ten members. He states that he believes in various deities, and follows the faith's concept of Ma'at, a guiding principle regarding truth and order that represents physical and moral balance in the universe. During a religious ceremony he received small tattoos encircling his wrist, written in the Coptic language, which express his servitude to Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun. When his employer asks him to cover the tattoos, he explains that it is a sin to cover them intentionally because doing so would signify a rejection of Ra. These can be religious beliefs and practices even if no one else or few other people subscribe to them.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 6--Personal Preference That Is Not a Religious Belief</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Sylvia's job has instituted a policy that employees cannot have visible tattoos while working. Sylvia refuses to cover a tattoo on her arm that is the logo of her favorite band. When her manager asks her to cover the tattoo, she states that she cannot and that she feels so passionately about the importance of the band to her life that it is essentially her religion. However, the evidence demonstrates that her tattoos and her feelings do not relate to any "ultimate concerns" such as life, purpose, death, humanity's place in the universe, or right and wrong, and they are not part of a moral or ethical belief system. Simply feeling passionately about something is not enough to give it the status of a religion in someone's life. Therefore, her belief is a personal preference that is not religious in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1045"></span>In March 2014, the Commission issued a factsheet entitled "Religious Garb and Grooming in the Workplace: Rights and Responsibilities," available on the EEOC website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm">http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm</a>, which also clarifies that Title VII extends to those who profess no religious beliefs:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The law's protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs. For example, an employer that is not a religious organization (as legally defined under Title VII) cannot make employees wear religious garb or articles (such as a cross) if they object on grounds of non-belief.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee claims to be part of an organized religion, then the practice for which accommodation is sought must be "not merely a matter of personal preference, but one of deep religious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living." <span class="Italic">Tamulevicz v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01860581 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Wisconsin v. Yoder</span>, 406 U.S. 205 (1972)). In <span class="Italic">Tamulevicz</span>, the employee, who was Catholic, maintained he needed Saturdays off to meditate and commune with the spiritual life. The Commission noted the employee did not show that the Saturday meditation was required by Catholic faith. The Commission also found the agency had not engaged in disparate treatment by accommodating a Jewish employee with Saturdays off, because that day is the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
<p class="noindent">Occasionally, the Commission does depart from its own guidance on the subject and decide cases involving religious beliefs on the basis that no organized religion holds similar beliefs. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Barron v. USPS</span>, 01873477 (1988) ("unionism" is not religious belief, but is clearly personal). In most of these cases, the Commission's reference to organized religion probably is incidental to a more fundamental decision that the belief involved is merely personal preference and does not rise to the level of a religious belief. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">LaViolette v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A01748 (2000) (employee stated a claim for relief with the allegation that his beliefs about cold fusion and other technologies constituted religious beliefs).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in its Compliance Manual at Section 12-I, A, 1, distinguishes between religious practices that may require accommodation and secular practices that do not. As its examples make clear, the practice in both cases may be the same and the focus is on the foundation of the practice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 2--Religious Practice versus Secular Practice</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Seventh-day Adventist employee follows a vegetarian diet because she believes it is religiously prescribed by the scriptural passage "[b]ut flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat," (Genesis 9:4). Her vegetarianism is a religious practice, even though not all Seventh-day Adventists share this belief or follow this practice, and even though many individuals adhere to a vegetarian diet for purely secular reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 5--Unique Belief Can Be Religious</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Edward practices the Kemetic religion, based on ancient Egyptian faith, and affiliates himself with a tribe numbering fewer than ten members. He states that he believes in various deities, and follows the faith's concept of Ma'at, a guiding principle regarding truth and order that represents physical and moral balance in the universe. During a religious ceremony he received small tattoos encircling his wrist, written in the Coptic language, which express his servitude to Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun. When his employer asks him to cover the tattoos, he explains that it is a sin to cover them intentionally because doing so would signify a rejection of Ra. These can be religious beliefs and practices even if no one else or few other people subscribe to them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 6--Personal Preference That is Not a Religious Belief</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sylvia wears several tattoos and has recently had her nose and eyebrows pierced. A newly hired manager implements a dress code that requires that employees have no visible piercings or tattoos. Sylvia says that her tattoos and piercings are religious because they reflect her belief in body art as self-expression and should be accommodated. However, the evidence demonstrates that her tattoos and piercings are not related to any religious belief system. For example, they do not function as a symbol of any religious belief, and do not relate to any "ultimate concerns" such as life, purpose, death, humanity's place in the universe, or right and wrong, and they are not part of a moral or ethical belief system. Therefore, her belief is a personal preference that is not religious in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent">The term "religion" includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief. As a result, a belief that there is no supreme being is protected. The proper test to apply is "whether the belief professed by a complainant is sincerely held and whether it is, in his own scheme of things, religious." <span class="Italic">Akers v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01932415 (1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Welsh v. United States</span>, 398 U.S. 333 (1970)).</p>
