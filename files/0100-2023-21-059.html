<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-53"><span class="space">26.</span> Tangible Employment Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, the Supreme Court attempted to draw a bright line between cases that involve tangible employment actions and those that do not, the line still gets blurred when a complainant, as part of a hostile environment claim, alleges that tangible employment actions have been combined with other conduct to create a hostile environment. The Commission noted such claims in <span class="Italic">Crane v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924585 (1993), quoting EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (March 19, 1990), when it stated that "[a]lthough '<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>' and 'hostile environment' harassment give rise to distinct claims, 'the line between the two is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together.'" The difficulty is not that such claims occur, but rather how to properly analyze such claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">Resolution of the difficulty goes back to the requirement that the complainant must show that the alleged harassing conduct is because of a protected characteristic. For example, the complainant alleging sexual harassment hostile environment must show that any tangible employment actions included in the claim were taken because of her sex. In other words, once again, the issue of intent arises. In evaluating the motivation of a supervisor or manager in taking a tangible employment action when there is no direct evidence of motivation, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis is applicable. In most cases, the fact that a personnel action has taken place in the midst of other conduct of a sexual nature is sufficient to raise an inference that the personnel action was based on sex--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it is sufficient to state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The burden then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions and finally shifts back to the complainant to demonstrate those reasons are pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent">Moreover, the complainant must show that the personnel actions were such that they created a hostile work environment. When dealing with routine personnel actions, this can be extremely difficult. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Ng v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A21421 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning first to complainant's claim that the agency's actions created a hostile work environment, we note that the substance of complainant's allegations concern personnel actions, changes in job responsibilities, or changes in workplace policies and procedures. For example, S1 acknowledged that complainant no longer has the computer security clearance that permits him access to the Local Area Network (LAN) at the highest level, but notes that when the LAN was changed to a newer version, all but two members of the unit lost access to the highest levels due to security concerns. S1 asserts that complainant does not need access to these levels in order to perform his job. Although complainant disputes this testimony, he presents no evidence that this, or any of the other personnel actions mentioned above, were objectively offensive, abusive, and hostile, or otherwise taken in order to harass him. Similarly, complainant asserts that he was denied training, but provides no details about what type of training he was denied. The record establishes that complainant received several training classes during the period in question. Even assuming, therefore, that he did not receive all of the training he desired, he offered no evidence to suggest that any training he was denied was due to anything other than an ordinary personnel action. We note that a reasonable person in complainant's position might find some of these personnel actions, such as loss of access to certain networks, denial of certain training, and exclusion from hiring choices, to be difficult or frustrating. However, the actions alleged are common workplace occurrences, and unless it is established that the actions were somehow abusive or offensive, and were taken in order to harass complainant on the basis of any of his protected classes, such everyday events are not sufficiently severe or pervasive as to constitute actionable harassment<span class="Italic">. See Lynch v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981027 (July 16, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01A34736.txt">01A34736</a> (2004), the Commission considered a suspension as part of a hostile environment claim even though it had already been expunged through the grievance process. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that soon after the November 27, 2001 incident in which Supervisor hugged and kissed complainant, complainant received a notice of a 28-day suspension, dated December 15, 2001. The suspension stated that complainant failed to work one hour of overtime as directed and purposely disobeyed an order. Coworker-1, however, corroborated complainant's testimony that he told complainant to turn in her money and that he would cover for her per Supervisor's direction. We find that complainant has proven that the reason provided for the suspension was pretextual. In its decision, the agency found that the suspension was expunged through a Step 1 grievance. We, however, find that, despite the suspension being expunged from complainant's personnel file, it is evidence of Supervisor's intent to take a tangible employment action against complainant when she failed to respond positively to Supervisor's harassment. Furthermore, although Supervisor denies that he participated in harassment and the creation of a hostile work environment, the Commission finds that the credibility of Supervisor is undermined by his complete and unsupported denial of all incidents, while both complainant and Coworker-1 provide very similar testimony as to two of the most critical incidents, namely that of November 27, 2001 and the suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also claimed that, on March 20 and May 19, 2002, she submitted vacation requests to which the agency failed to respond. The agency has provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, however. Specifically, Supervisor testified that complainant requested non-choice leave, but non-choice leave was posted from November 5 through December 2001, and the request was eventually granted. We find that complainant has failed to show that these reasons are pretextual. As for complainant's leave request of May 29, 2002, Supervisor asserted that it was granted on June 1, 2002, when complainant brought her medical certificate. We find that the agency failed to provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for this action, as it merely states that the leave was granted upon receipt of the medical certificate. The agency makes no showing that such documentation was required of others under similar circumstances. Therefore, we must find that complainant has established that the agency discriminated against her when it first denied her leave request for May 29, pending medical certification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency contends that complainant began making charges of sexual harassment because her request for limited duty was denied, the record reflects that more than ten months passed between the denial of limited duty and complainant's first contact with the agency regarding the sexual harassment on January 10, 2002. Moreover, Coworker-1 corroborated complainant's accounts of the November 27, 2001 incident and the suspension. Finally, we note that, while complainant sought EEO Counseling on January 10, 2002, the agency does not appear to have taken any action until May 22, 2002, when complainant met with the EEO representative, her representative, and the Postal Operation Manager regarding the harassment and hostile work environment, The record reflects that Supervisor continued to supervise complainant despite her complaint of sexual harassment.<span class="Italic"> Hayes v. United States Postal Service,</span> Appeal No. 01954703 (January 23, 1998) (Where the agency knows or has reason to know about the occurrence of acts of sexual harassment on the part of its employees, but fails to take immediate and effective action reasonably calculated to end the harassment, it will be held liable for a violation of Title VII.). In this regard, we find the agency knew of the hostile work environment created by Supervisor, but failed to take effective remedial action to end the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the record shows that complainant was in fact subjected to unlawful sexual harassment by Supervisor. The record supports complainant's contention that Supervisor sexually harassed her and subjected her to a hostile work environment because of her sex. Furthermore, Supervisor tried to unjustly suspend complainant for 28 <span id="Page_854"></span>days, the reason for that suspension shown through testimony to be untrue, as well as deny her leave on May 29, 2002 until she provided the agency with a medical certificate. We also find that the conduct was sufficiently severe when evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. Finally, the evidence of record supports a finding that the agency acted with insufficient dispatch in ending a situation that it knew was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Toland v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a53172.txt">01A53172</a> (2005), the Commission went further and held that it could consider past discrete personnel actions that were allegedly part of a hostile environment claim even though those past actions had already been adjudicated, finding that the agency had improperly fragmented the claims. Although consideration of the past incidents did not assist the complainant, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Toland</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant filed previous EEO complaints (see Agency Nos. 4E-680-0038-04 and 4E-680-0103-04) and refers to them in her present complaint dated January 21, 2005. In her statement appealing the agency's final decision, complainant argues that those prior claims should be considered, along with the current incident, as establishing the existence of a hostile work environment. Typically, complaints that have been adjudicated by the agency and are subject to final Commission decisions are no longer reviewable on <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> grounds. However, it appears here that the agency improperly fragmented the claims raised by complainant in each of these prior complaints and did not analyze the specified incidents as evidence of alleged harassment. Therefore, we choose to consider the incidents raised in those prior complaints with the incident raised in the present complaint to evaluate whether together they state a claim of harassment in accordance to <span class="Italic">National Railroad Passenger Corp v. Morgan,</span> 536 U.S. 101 (June 10, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment is actionable only if it is sufficiently severe of pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17 (Nov. 9, 1993). In determining whether such harassment created an objectively hostile work environment, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> instructs us to evaluate the following criteria: the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">See Harris,</span> 510 U.S. at 23. Given these guidelines, the incidents alleged in the current and prior complaints, even when viewed together, do not rise to the level of actionable harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to have discrete personnel actions included in a hostile environment claim, the complainant must make some showing that the actions were hostile or offensive, or part of an overall pattern of harassment. In <span class="Italic">Goines v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A54108 (2006), the complainant made a hostile environment claim, including such discrete personnel actions as a negative performance counseling, denial of a request for a change in supervision as an accommodation, and a formal warning on sick leave usage. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Goines</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant failed to establish that he was subjected to a hostile work environment as he alleged. Specifically, with regard to claims (2)-(5), the Commission notes that the substance of complainant's allegations concern personnel actions, and complainant presents no evidence that any of the above actions were objectively offensive, abusive or hostile, and otherwise taken in order to harass him. The actions alleged are common workplace occurrences, and unless it is reasonably established that the actions were somehow abusive or offensive, and were taken in order to harass complainant on the basis of any of his protected classes, such everyday events are not sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to offend the general sensibility of an individual experiencing such occurrences in the workplace. <span class="Italic">See Wolf v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961559 (July 23, 1998). <span class="Italic">See also Long v. Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950169 (August 14, 1997); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980746 (September 19, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that under <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, discrete personnel acts must be brought to the attention of a counselor within 45 days for a claim to be timely. As a result, if the complainant alleges that a personnel action is part of a hostile environment claim, there should be no relief available for that action unless counseling was timely initiated. The personnel action can be used, however, as evidence in the hostile environment claim. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">James v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0520120488 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In asserting that untimely discrete acts raised by Complainant should not be a part of this hostile work environment claim, the Agency misapplies <span class="Italic">National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. 101 (2002). It is true that under <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, a discrete act is independently actionable only if it occurred with the applicable time limitation period. A discrete act that occurred before the relevant time limitation period is untimely even if it is related to other actions that are timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But what the Agency crucially misses is that even untimely discrete acts can be used as background evidence in support of timely actions. Generally for hostile work environment claims, all of the incidents that make up the same hostile work environment claim are actionable as long as at least one incident occurred within the time limitation period. This includes any incidents that an employee suspected were discriminatory before the time limitation period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A discrete act that occurred outside the time limitation period may be part of a hostile work environment claim, in that the discrete act may be considered in determining whether the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to be actionable, and the appropriate relief for the hostile work environment. What is not available to the complainant is relief for the discrete act itself because the untimely discrete act is not separately actionable.</p>
