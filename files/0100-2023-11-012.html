<p class="noindent">Subject to the exceptions discussed below in "<a href="0100-2023-11-014.html#sec2-15">Extending the Time Period for Initiating Counseling</a>," when a personnel action is involved, the time period for contacting the counselor begins with the effective date of the action, not the notice of intent. 29 CFR 1614.105(a)(1). The 45-day time period is measured in calendar days, not working days. 29 CFR 1614.604(a). The counting of days in the time limit starts with the day after the effective date of the personnel action. 29 CFR 1614.604(d). If the 45th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, the time period is extended until the next business day. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 01821353 (1983)--a case decided under the previous 30-day time limit--the EEOC rejected the agency's argument that the complaint was untimely when the appellant was notified of the proposal to remove on October 30, but the action was not effective until December 25 and contact with the counselor was made on December 30. The EEOC distinguished the <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> case from <span class="Italic">Delaware State College v. Ricks</span>, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed.2d 431 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Ricks</span>, the plaintiff, a college professor, was informed that he would not be granted tenure. The plaintiff was also informed that his employment contract would be extended for one year. The plaintiff, however, did not file a complaint at the time he was denied tenure but waited until after his employment had actually been terminated. The Supreme Court found that the time period for filing a complaint of discrimination had expired because the plaintiff was reasonably certain tenure would not be granted, even though his contract had been extended for one year. The Supreme Court held that, in determining the time limit for filing a complaint of discrimination, "'[t]he proper focus is upon the time of the discriminatory acts, not upon the time which the consequences of the acts became most painful.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 258, (quoting <span class="Italic">Abramson v. University of Hawaii</span>, 594 F.2d 202, 209 (9th Cir. 1979)).</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Green v. Brennan</span>, No. 14-613 (2016), the Supreme Court held that where a resignation, precipitated by an agreement between the employee and the agency, the U.S. Postal Service, was later alleged to be a constructive discharge, the 45-day time period began to run from the date of resignation, not the date of the agreement. The <span class="Italic">Green</span> case may seem at odds with the <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> case from a notice standpoint, meaning, if one follows the <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> reasoning, Green was reasonably certain that he was going to resign when he signed the settlement agreement. It seems that the difference lies in the matter alleged to be discriminatory. In <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> the employment practice challenged as unlawful was the University's decision to not grant the plaintiff tenure, not the termination, whereas in <span class="Italic">Green</span> the challenged employment practice was his resignation. The <span class="Italic">Green</span> Court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before a federal civil servant can sue his employer in court for discriminating against him in violation of Title VII, he must first exhaust his administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c). To exhaust those remedies, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has promulgated regulations that require, among other things, that a federal employee consult with an EEO counselor prior to filing a discrimination lawsuit. Specifically, he "must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1). The timeliness of Green's claim therefore turns on our interpretation of this EEOC regulation implementing Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we begin our interpretation of the regulation with its text, the text in this case is not particularly helpful. Nowhere does &#x00A7; 1614.105 indicate whether a "matter alleged to be discriminatory" in a constructive-discharge claim includes the employee's resignation, as Green contends, or only the employer's discriminatory conduct, as amica contends. The word "matter" simply means "an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense," <span class="small">BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY</span> 1126 (10th ed. 2014)--a term that could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation. So the "matter alleged to be discriminatory" could refer to all of the allegations underlying a claim of discrimination, including the employee's resignation, or only to those allegations concerning the employer's discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore must turn to other canons of interpretation. The most helpful canon in this context is "the 'standard rule'" for limitations periods. <span class="Italic">Graham County Soil &#x0026; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson</span>, 545 U.S. 409, 418 (2005). Ordinarily, a "'limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.'" <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. "[A] cause of action does not become 'complete and present' for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief." <span class="Italic">Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal</span>., 522 U.S. 192, 201 (1997). Although the standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit, we "will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication" in the text of the limitations period. <span class="Italic">Reiter v. Cooper</span>, 507 U.S. 258, 267 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this default rule, we are persuaded that the "matter alleged to be discriminatory" in a constructive discharge claim necessarily includes the employee's resignation for three reasons. First, in the context of a constructive-discharge claim, a resignation is part of the "complete and present cause of action" necessary before a limitations period ordinarily begins to run. Second, nothing in the regulation creating the limitations period here, &#x00A7; 1614.105, clearly indicates an intent to displace this standard rule. Third, practical considerations confirm the merit of applying the standard rule here. We therefore interpret the term "matter alleged to be discriminatory" for a constructive-discharge claim to include the date Green resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission distinguished <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> from <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> because the agency had twice canceled the complainant's pending removal, the Commission also noted that it was unnecessary to distinguish the two cases because the Commission's regulations provide that the time period for contacting a counselor begins from the effective date of a personnel action. In effect, the Commission has replaced <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> with a bright-line regulatory rule. Instead of having to determine when the "discriminatory acts," as opposed to their consequences, actually occurred, the complainant need only determine the effective date of the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Vrooman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965879 (1997); <span class="Italic">Dudley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960067 (1996) (stating that the time to contact an EEO counselor runs not from the time an employee is notified of a pending employment action, but from the time the action becomes effective).</p>
<p class="noindent">The reasoning behind using the effective date of the personnel action is that, until the action becomes effective, the employee suffers no harm and the agency may rescind the proposed action. This is particularly true for competitive service federal employees who have certain oral and written statutory reply rights to a wide array of proposed personnel actions. Under these circumstances, it would be premature to begin the time period on the date of notice of the proposed action. The Commission's regulations require the dismissal of complaints on the basis that the action is in the proposal stage and not yet effective. 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(5). This prohibition prevents the duplication of effort previously required when an employee filed a complaint over the proposed action and another complaint when the action became effective.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Purcell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05931188 (1994), the Commission seemed to rebuff that very reasoning. In that case, the Commission found that contact with the counselor was untimely where it was made several months after a request to extend a tour assignment was denied, but within 45 days of the actual reassignment. The complainant contended that until the time he actually was reassigned, the agency official responsible for the decision could have changed his mind. In rejecting that contention in <span class="Italic">Purcell</span>, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the record indicates that the previous decision erroneously found that appellant contacted an EEO counselor in a timely manner because he acted within 30 days of the effective date of his ultimate reassignment to Fort Huachuca, Arizona. However, a careful review of the contents of both appellant's initial request for EEO counseling and his formal complaint indicates that both the former and the latter are complaining about the decision of a particular agency official to deny appellant's tour extension. This decision was initially rendered in November of 1991, and appellant was clearly aware of the decision long before he decided to contact a counselor in late June of 1992. Appellant appears to admit that this was the case in his response to the agency's request for reconsideration when he states that the official who denied his tour extension could have reversed his decision at any time until his reassignment and indicates that he "wanted to give him every opportunity to do that." Appellant's complaint also makes it clear that he believes that the essence of the alleged discriminatory action against him occurred when his tour extension was denied, in that he asserts that the subject agency official told him in November 1991 that the reason for this denial was that he had "Been here too long" and that he believed that such a statement showed an animus towards older employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Purcell</span> seems to be at odds with its policy on proposed actions. This is particularly true when the complainant may have avoided the result by complaining that his reassignment was discriminatory, instead of alleging that the decision to deny his request for an extension of his tour of duty was discriminatory. By far, the best policy for complainants is to initiate counseling at the earliest possible juncture. The complaint may be dismissed as premature, but that still leaves intact the complainant's right to reinitiate counseling when the action takes effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission makes no mention in <span class="Italic">Purcell</span> of the statutory right of a federal employee to respond to a proposed adverse action, that could provide the distinguishing basis between <span class="Italic">Purcell</span> and a case like <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, where the employee has statutory reply rights. In <span class="Italic">Purcell</span>, like in <span class="Italic">Ricks</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span id="Page_42"></span>the personnel decision was purely discretionary in nature. It is true that the employer could change its mind prior to implementing the decision, but there is no requirement that the employer even consider the employee's point of view. In cases like <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, where a proposed personnel action is at issue, the agency is required by law to consider the employee's reply and, thereafter, issue a final written decision on the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Bolt v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01971841 (1998), the Commission undermined any rationale supporting a reasonable distinction between <span class="Italic">Purcell</span> and <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>. In <span class="Italic">Bolt</span>, the agency changed an employee's status from travel time to annual leave, after the fact. The agency dismissed the employee's complaint as untimely because she did not contact a counselor within 45 days of being informed of the agency's intent to change her status. The employee did, however, contact a counselor within 45 days of the actual change in status. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bolt</span>, reinstated the complaint, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In allegation (b) appellant alleged that on June 7, 1996 she was charged annual leave in lieu of travel time while en route home from TDY. The agency found that appellant failed to timely contact an EEO Counselor regarding allegation (b). Appellant argues that she was not aware that she was going to be charged leave for June 7, 1996 until she saw a letter dated August 16, 1996 stating that she should be charged leave. Appellant claims that she was not actually charged leave for June 7, 1996 until she received her Leave and Earnings Statement (for the pay period ending August 31, 1996) on September 6, 1996. Appellant submitted a copy of two Leave and Earnings Statement for the pay period ending August 31, 1996 which reflects that there has been an adjustment in which 8 hours of annual leave was deducted from her balance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal the agency argues that appellant "was on notice, no later than 8 July 1996, that she would not be carried in a 'travel status' for 7 June 1996." The alleged act of discrimination in allegation (b), the Commission finds, is not the agency's intention to charge appellant with annual leave for June 7, 1996, but is the actual charging of appellant's leave. The Commission finds that regardless of when appellant might have been aware of how the agency intended to treat appellant's leave for June 7, 1996, appellant was not aware, nor reasonably aware, of the actual personnel action of charging her with leave until she received her Leave and Earnings Statement for the pay period ending August 31, 1996. Appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor on September 17, 1996 regarding allegation (b) was within the 45 day time limit and was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, <span class="Italic">Purcell</span> remains an anomaly and represents nothing more than a case wrongly decided by the Commission. But in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A22119 (2003), Commission held that the agency improperly dismissed the complainant's claim that he was denied a quality assurance stamp to do his job. In <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, the complainant did not file a complaint until eight days after the assignment requiring the stamp had ended. However, the Commission "finds that since complainant demonstrated he had been denied the QA stamp up to and until the time of his reassignment, his claim concerned a present, albeit ongoing, agency action that was timely raised." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission continues to struggle with its application of the difference between situations like <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> where the time period is triggered by notification and situations where the time period is not triggered until the effective date of the action. In <span class="Italic">Selmani v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A31311 (2003), the complainant was notified in June 2002 that his overseas assignment would not be extended beyond the end of the year. The complainant did not initiate counseling until after he resigned claiming the refusal to extend caused his resignation. The Commission found the request for counseling timely. Particularly given the absence of any detailed analysis in these cases, it is hard to draw a reasoned distinction with cases like <span class="Italic">Bolt</span> and, as a result, no clear rule emerges.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120082041 (2008), the Commission reversed an agency dismissal of a complaint involving a reassignment from a special agent to a revenue agent position. As a result of the reassignment, the complainant was no longer eligible for law enforcement availability pay and retirement benefits. Although the agency affected the reassignment in June 2004, it did not terminate her retirement benefits until September 2007 to deduct payments for the retirement fund from the complainant's pay. The Commission determined that counselor contact was timely where it occurred within 45 days of the actual termination of her retirement benefits in September 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important that the agency properly define the personnel action at issue prior to determining whether counselor contact is timely. In <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01974075 (1998), the Commission reversed an agency determination that counselor contact was untimely on the basis that the agency had improperly defined the personnel action at issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the final agency decision, the appellant alleged in her complaint of March 29, 1995, that, as a result of discrimination based on her race (black), she was denied a promotion or upgrade from Painter Worker, WG-4102-07, to Painter, WG-4102-09, in Shop 71 of the agency's Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision dismissed the appellant's complaint pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(b) for untimely EEO counselor contact. The decision represented that the appellant had not provided any date when she had been denied a promotion or upgrade. The decision also represented that the most recent promotion of anyone to a WG-9 Painter position under the merit promotion program occurred in December 1989. The decision found that the appellant contacted the EEO Counselor on December 21, 1994, well beyond the 45-day period for initiating a timely complaint. In addition, the decision held that the receipt of the appellant's paycheck every two weeks did not constitute an act of discrimination denying the appellant a promotion or an upgrade. The decision reasoned that the 45-day period for contacting a counselor runs from the date of a specific act of discrimination and not from the dates of an effect or inevitable consequence of an alleged discriminatory act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the entire record, the Commission finds that the agency erred when it addressed the appellant's complaint as if it focuses on the agency's failure to award the appellant a promotion pursuant to the agency's merit promotion system. Based on the EEO Counselor's Report, the Notice of Final Interview, and the formal complaint, the Commission finds that the thrust of the appellant's complaint is that the appellant allegedly performs work for which the agency compensates other employees at the WG-9 level but compensates the appellant at the WG-7 level. Specifically, the appellant alleges in her complaint that she performs all of the painting work and possesses all of the trade skill possessed by the WG-9 journeymen painters but she is paid at a WG-7 rate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the appellant timely raised her claim with the EEO Counselor on December 21, 1994, because the appellant continued to receive WG-7 pay for allegedly WG-9 work she performed within the 45-day period which preceded her EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">Normally, promotions are discrete personnel actions and, unless the complainant presents some reason for extending or waiving the time limit, the 45-day period begins to run from the effective date of the promotion. Because many agencies do not advise unsuccessful applicants, however, the time period may not run until the complainant knew or should have known he or she was not selected. See, sections below "<a href="0100-2023-11-011.html#sec2-12">Notification Of Personnel Action</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-11-015.html#sec2-16">Tolling The Time Period For Counseling</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Career ladder promotions also provide their own exception to the 45-day limit. The Commission regards denial of career ladder promotions as a recurring violation, with a new violation occurring every day the complainant is not given the promotion. As a result, a complaint is timely if, within 45 days of counselor contact, the complainant had not been granted the career ladder promotion<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Englund v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01A10826 (2001). Recurring or serial violations are discussed below in the section "<a href="0100-2023-11-053.html#sec2-53">Continuing Violations</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee may not resurrect an untimely claim by renewing his request for the agency to take some action and then initiating counselor contact within the appropriate time period after the subsequent denial. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cramer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911530 (1991), the complainant requested reinstatement with the agency after resigning. The agency refused to reinstate him, but the complainant took no action. He twice repeated his request for reinstatement and only contacted a counselor after the third denial. The Commission, relying on <span class="Italic">Mitilinakis v. Chicago</span>, 52 FEP 1387 (N.D. Ill. 1990), found that the second and third denials of reinstatement were "simply 'present consequences'" of the original alleged discriminatory act. They did not constitute independent acts that could be used to trigger new limitations periods.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, if the agency does take some action that changes the effective date of the personnel action, the time limit for counselor contact runs from the later effective date of the action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A30967 (2003), the complainant filed a grievance over a removal that was effective May 15, 2002. In a decision denying the grievance, the agency changed the effective date of the removal to June 25th. The complainant was not notified of this new effective date until the decision on the grievance was issued on July 18. As a result, his August 12th counselor contact was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the complainant's changed circumstances can make the denial of a subsequent request sufficiently different from the initial denial to trigger a complainant's rights anew. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pointer v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10057 (2003), the Commission found that EEO counseling was timely initiated based on a subsequent request for reinstatement that was denied even where counseling would not have been timely with respect to the initial denial of the request for reinstatement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pointer</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[L]ike the AJ, we reject the agency's argument that complainant should be precluded from "renewing" her claim by making repeated requests which she "knew" would be denied. On the contrary, we find that complainant made her requests at somewhat lengthy intervals, allowing her time to demonstrate a consistent ability to work full time. We also note that after the agency denied her early requests, complainant submitted up-dated documentation, both medical and employment related, and ultimately obtained assistance from the union, to include the union vice president personally contacting agency officials to persuade them to reinstate complainant. We find that this course of conduct clearly evidences on-going attempts by complainant to convince the agency to reinstate <span id="Page_43"></span>her. Accordingly, we that the AJ properly determined that the instant complaint was timely.</p>
