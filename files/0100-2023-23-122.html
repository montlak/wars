<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-120"><span class="space">D.</span> EMPLOYMENT CRITERIA AND QUALIFICATION STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">As with the other bases of discrimination, an agency may not use employment tests or other selection procedures that disproportionately disqualify or tend to disproportionately disqualify persons with disabilities as a class or any subclass of disabled persons, unless the agency can demonstrate the test or procedure is job-related to the position in question and consistent with business necessity, and there is no alternative test or procedure that would achieve the agency's legitimate goal without disqualifying a disproportionate number of individuals with disabilities. Title 29 CFR 1630.10 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;In general. It is unlawful for a covered entity to use qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Qualification standards and tests related to uncorrected vision. Notwithstanding &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(vi) of this part, a covered entity shall not use qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria based on an individual's uncorrected vision unless the standard, test, or other selection criterion, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. An individual challenging a covered entity's application of a qualification standard, test, or other criterion based on uncorrected vision need not be a person with a disability, but must be adversely affected by the application of the standard, test, or other criterion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cleveland C., et al. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120170405 (2018), a case decided under the ADAAA, the Commission vacated the agency's consolidated final decision with the instruction that on remand the agency was to determine whether it violated the Rehabilitation Act by applying the "Qualification Standard" analysis. That case involved ten police officers who developed a skin disorder from shaving their faces too often. Agency regulations required police officers to maintain a clean-shaven face because facial hair interfered with the sealing mechanism on respirators used for protection from chemical, physical and biological hazards. The agency directed the complainants to shave their faces or accept a reassignment with a possible pay reduction or termination. The agency found that the complainants were not individuals with a disability because their skin disorder did not substantially limit their employment. The Commission remanded that decision, in <span class="Italic">Cleveland C., et al</span>., and provided good instruction on how to the "Qualification Standard" should be analyzed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we determine that the Agency erred in finding that Complainants were not individuals with a disability. First, we find that Complainants had a physical impairment affecting the skin in that they were diagnosed with Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, a chronic bacterial skin disorder resulting from ingrown hairs that causes skin irritation, rashes, sores, scarring, infection, among other symptoms brought on by clean shaving.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we find that this bacterial skin disorder substantially limited Complainants in the operation of major bodily functions, including the immune system and the skin. Because the operation of a major bodily function is a major life activity, Complainants have shown that they have a physical impairment of the skin that substantially limits them in major life activities, and therefore have established that they are individuals with a disability, pursuant to the ADAAA and Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be entitled to protection under the Rehabilitation Act, Complainants must also show that they were "qualified" individuals with a disability. A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency does not dispute that Complainants satisfied the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position of Police Officer. Rather, the Agency believes that Complainants are unable to perform the job safely because they cannot meet a specific requirement imposed by the Agency: wear negative pressure APR protective masks with clean-shaven skin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the question of whether Complainants are or are not "qualified" to perform the job of Police Officer hinges on whether the standard they are unable to meet (wear a negative pressure protective mask with clean-shaven skin) has been justified by the Agency and, if it has been justified, whether there is a reasonable accommodation (including the use of an alternate standard) that would enable them to meet the standard. <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we determine that the Agency applied the wrong legal analysis in its final decision. The Agency should have analyzed whether the qualification standard at issue here, the requirement that police officers wear negative pressure protective masks while clean-shaven, violated the Rehabilitation Act, using the specific "Qualification Standard" analysis described below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulations define "qualification standards" as "the personal and professional attributes including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety, and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(q). "The term 'qualification standard' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace." 29 C.F.R. 1630.15(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A qualification standard, selection criteria, or employment test that screens out or tends to screen out a person with a disability or a class of persons with disabilities, violates the Rehabilitation Act unless the employer is able to show that the standard, test, or criteria meets the affirmative defenses laid out in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainants' disability prevented them from being clean shaven, which the Agency maintained disqualified them from wearing negative pressure protective masks because, in the Agency's opinion, the masks could not create adequate protective seals with their skin. Therefore, the Agency believed Complainants' disability prevented them from meeting the Agency's negative pressure protective mask and clean-shaven standard. This resulted in Complainants being stripped of their Police Officer duties and placed on light duty until they chose to comply and fully shave their faces.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question then is whether the Agency is able to justify the qualification standard under the test set forth under the law. In order to justify a standard, the statute requires that the Agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1) show that the standard, criteria, or test is "job-related and consistent with business necessity"; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2) show that there is no accommodation that would enable the person to meet the existing standard or no alternative approach (itself a form of accommodation) through which the employer can determine whether the person can perform the essential function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(h); <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When determining if a standard or test is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the central question is whether the standard or test is "carefully tailored to measure [an individual's] actual ability to [perform] the essential function of the job" H.R. Rep. 101-485(11) at 36, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. 1990, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 353-5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, upon remand, the Agency's new consolidated final decision should determine whether the qualification standard of wearing a negative pressure protective mask while clean-shaven was carefully tailored to measure Complainants' actual ability to perform the essential functions of a police officer. Possible evidence to consider may include: the number of documented instances (or lack of documented instances) when negative pressure protective masks did not seal correctly due to Complainants' facial hair; whether Complainants passed their mask fit tests with facial hair; and how often Complainants had to don these respirators while performing the essential functions of a police officer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If upon remand, the Agency determines that the qualification standard of wearing a negative pressure mask while clean-shaven is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the Agency must then consider both accommodations that enable Complainants to meet the standard and alternative approaches through which the Agency can determine whether Complainants can perform the essential functions of a police officer. Such accommodations and alternative approaches to investigate and consider upon remand include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--allowing Complainants to wear negative pressure masks with facial hair, if negative pressure masks can in fact form adequate protective seals with faces that have a small degree of facial hair; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--allowing Complainants to wear other types of protective masks, such as Powered Air-Purifying Respirators, with facial hair.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in its consolidated final decision, the Agency maintained that it properly applied OSHA regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134 in implementing PFPA Regulation No. 9420. But the Agency's decision did not address a provision of the OSHA regulation that contemplates providing Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPR) to those who cannot use a negative pressure mask due to a medical condition:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the respirator is a negative pressure respirator and [a physician or other licensed health care professional] finds a medical condition that may place the employee's health at increased risk if the respirator is used, the employer shall provide a PAPR if the [physician's] medical evaluation finds that the employee can use such a respirator....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(e)(6)(ii)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, upon remand, when the Agency investigates and considers the alternative approach of allowing Complainants to wear Powered Air-Purifying Respirators with facial hair, the Agency's supplemental investigation and new consolidated final decision should examine whether 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(e)(6)(ii) is relevant, applicable, and perhaps dispositive, to these cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this juncture, the Commission determines that it would be inappropriate for it to adjudicate the question of whether the Agency used a discriminatory qualification standard in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The Agency's consolidated final decision applied the wrong legal analysis, and subsequently neither parties' briefs properly addressed the qualification-standards issues relevant to these appeals. Additionally, the record is unclear as to what extent OSHA regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(e)(6)(ii) is applicable and relevant to the Agency's policy and qualification standard and to Complainant's disability claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we remand these cases to the Agency with specific instructions to conduct a supplemental investigation on whether there is an accommodation that would enable Complainants to meet the existing standard or alternative approach through which the Agency could determine whether Complainants can perform the essential functions of a police officer. After the Agency conducts its supplemental investigation and provides Complainants with a reasonable opportunity to provide a rebuttal, the Agency must issue a new consolidated final decision, with specific instructions to apply the "qualification standards" framework above in determining whether the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Basing a decision not to rehire an employee because of a past record of absences can be a criterion that tends to screen out persons with disabilities. In <span class="Italic">Pointer v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10057 (2003), the Commission found a rehiring policy improperly screened out a complainant with lupus who was previously terminated from a job with the agency due to absences caused by the disease. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pointer</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, we find that the agency concedes that complainant is an individual with a disability due to her medical condition (lupus), but argues that she is not entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act because she is not a "qualified" individual with a disability. Specifically, the agency argues an employee who cannot come to work cannot perform the essential functions of her position, noting that even with an accommodation (LCA), complainant's absences were so excessive due to her medical condition that she was terminated from employment. In this regard, the agency further argues that during the time of these excessive absences, complainant's medical documentation reflected that her lupus was in remission, and that the current medical documentation supporting her April 1997 request for reinstatement, which reflects essentially this same assessment, is insufficient to demonstrate that complainant is now "qualified." Notwithstanding this observation, however, the agency argues that it properly confined its ultimate decision to only complainant's original March 1995 request (which was made without any supporting documentation), and correctly found that it failed to demonstrate a change in her medical condition or ability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether complainant was "qualified," the AJ considered all of her requests for reinstatement, and found that complainant's up-dated medical documentation, as well as her testimony regarding her ability to perform the functions of her former position, demonstrated that she was "qualified." We concur with this determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's medical statement, dated September 17, 1997, reflects that complainant's medical condition has been under good control for the last four years, and that on current examination she looks "quite normal" and is off all medications. In a handwritten notation, the physician further indicates that complainant is able to work full time. We find that this statement is highly probative because it is based on the results of a recent examination, and the physician is an expert in complainant's medical condition (Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California and Stanford university Medical Schools, as well as the Chief of Rheumatology at Highland Hospital in Alameda California), and has personally treated complainant for lupus for many years. Additionally, we find the statements from complainant's recent employers fully corroborate this medical assessment, and constitute highly probative evidence that complainant is "qualified." One statement indicates that complainant worked for a private company from February 1994 to March 1996, noting that complainant was an excellent employee who had only been absent twice and was always on time. The other statement indicates that complainant then worked for another private company, from April 1996 to March 1997, with no indication of any problems whatsoever. Moreover, we further find that the agency improperly considered only complainant's March 1995 request, thereby ignoring her supporting documentation. Therefore, based on this evidence, we concur with the AJ that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability, and entitled to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After finding that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the AJ next analyzed the case under the accommodation provisions of the Rehabilitation Act. However, while we agree with the AJ's ultimate conclusion in this case, we nonetheless find that the instant complaint is more properly analyzed under 29 C.F.R. 1630.10, which ensures that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from job opportunities unless they are actually unable to do the job<span class="Italic">. See</span> Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 29 C.F.R. 1630.10 (July 1, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. 1630.10 provides that it is unlawful for an agency to use qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out, an individual <span id="Page_1209"></span>with a disability, or class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the agency, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. The qualification standards, as applied in a particular case, must constitute an accurate measure of a complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position at issue<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 323.232 of the agency's "Employment and Placement" regulations, which address both reinstatement and re-hiring of former employees, as more fully interpreted in Handbook EL-311 at Section 313.53, states that it is agency policy to refuse employment to persons removed from the Postal Service for cause, and in those exceptional cases where appointment of such an individual is contemplated, approval by a designated agency official must be first obtained. Further, Section 313.53 of this same handbook also specifies that excessive tardiness or absence can justify eliminating an eligible from consideration if the service was recent and if there is no indication that the individual has improved his or her work habits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the agency's "reinstatement/re-hire policy" should be analyzed as a "qualification standard" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. 1630.10. In specifically applying this policy to complainant's request for reinstatement, which it limited to only her March 1995 request, the agency determined that based on complainant's "prior work history and unchanged physical condition," she could not perform an essential function of her position (attendance) regardless of accommodation, noting that "there was nothing to indicate that complainant could satisfactorily perform her job duties." Furthermore, the agency averred that it had a legitimate business reason not to re-hire employees discharged for cause, contending that past performance is a good indicator of an employee's future performance. In specifically referring to complainant, the agency further averred that a business is not obligated to tolerate erratic, unreliable attendance or provide an accommodation which would impose an undue hardship. The agency argues that it is not controverted that employees who cannot maintain satisfactory attendance adversely impact the operation of any employer, including the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the agency's policy not to re-hire employees discharged for cause, when applied to complainant, who was discharged because of excessive absences associated with a disability, screens her out on the basis of disability, failing to provide any measure whatsoever of complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position to which she seeks reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.10. Moreover, regarding the agency's proffered business necessity, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> employees need to have good attendance, we find that rigid application of the policy permitted the agency to ignore complainant's updated medical and employment documentation, which in this case precludes a foregone conclusion that her past performance at the agency will always be indicative of her future performance. Here, we find that complainant not only submitted medical evidence showing that her medical condition has been stable for four years, and is not an impediment to full time employment, but she also submitted evidence demonstrating that she recently and currently maintained successful full time employment with no attendance problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the agency's application of its reinstatement/re-hire policy in responding to complainant's request for reinstatement, cannot be construed as an accurate measure of complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of her former position, and screened out her request on the basis of disability<span class="Italic">. See</span> Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 29 C.F.R. 1630.10 (July 1, 2000). Therefore, we conclude that the agency discriminated against complainant based on her disability when it applied its reinstatement/re-hire policy to her when she requested reinstatement to her former position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Interestingly, in <span class="Italic">Pointer</span> the Commission made no comment on the agency's use of attendance as an essential function of a position. As discussed above, the Commission's position has been that attendance is not an essential function of a position, but should be evaluated in terms of whether the complainant's lack of attendance or erratic attendance would impose an undue hardship on the agency. It is not clear from <span class="Italic">Pointer</span> that the Commission is taking a different position in cases involving employment standards as opposed to requests for accommodation. It could simply be that the Commission did not feel there was a need in <span class="Italic">Pointer</span> to distinguish between attendance as an essential function and attendance as an undue hardship since such a distinction would not have altered the outcome of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Encloe v. Secretary of State</span>, 01A42370 (2005), the Commission found that a Foreign Service requirement of worldwide availability was job-related and consistent with business necessity because the Foreign Service Act requires that a "member of the Foreign Service should be available to serve in assignment throughout the world." Thus, it was permissible to exclude the complainant from the Service because of an eye condition that required follow-up evaluations on periodic basis over the next two or three years. Similarly, the same qualification standard was upheld in <span class="Italic">Jean-Julien v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120050340 (2007), where the complainant suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The complainant had three psychotic episodes that resulted in hospitalization and had also stopped taking his medication on several occasions. The Commission determined that the complainant could not perform the essential function of being available for worldwide assignment because he needed an English-speaking therapist who could monitor his medication and the medication itself was not available worldwide. See Chapter 15 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-24-184.html#sec15-158">Foreign Service Assignments</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Strano v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120101287 (2012), the Commission stressed the importance of distinguishing claims that an employment criterion screens out individuals with disabilities from claims of disparate treatment or intentional discrimination. In finding the investigation in <span class="Italic">Strano</span> was inadequate and remanding the case for further investigation, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find that Complainant alleged that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by using selection criteria for promotion that screened out, or tended to screen out, an individual with a disability, and the Agency erred when it implicitly dismissed this claim by refraining it as a disparate treatment, intentional discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, an agency may not use a selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out an individual or class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the agency demonstrates that the selection criterion is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10. A selection criterion is job-related and consistent with business necessity if it accurately measures the ability to perform the job's essential functions (i.e. its fundamental duties). Even where a challenged selection criterion is job-related and consistent with business necessity, if it screens out an individual on the basis of disability, an agency must also demonstrate that the criterion cannot be met, and the job cannot be performed, with a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(6); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.10, 1630.15(b) and (c); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.10, 1630.15(b) and (c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of this provision is to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from job opportunities unless they are actually unable to do the job and to ensure that there is a fit between job criteria and an employee's actual ability to do the job. Accordingly, job criteria that even unintentionally screen out, or tend to screen out, an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities because of their disability may not be used, unless the agency demonstrates that the criteria are job-related to the position and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find the record to be inadequately developed to decide whether the Agency discriminatorily applied selection criteria for promoting Foreign Service Officers to the FS-03 grade level. The record contains no evidence showing the extent to which the 2008 Board considered the portion of a candidate's career spent in assignments abroad, and how they determined whether a candidate had demonstrated competence in service abroad.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the record contain any evidence showing whether use of these selection criteria screened out or tended to screen out individuals with disabilities. In his summary of the investigation, the investigator noted that he took a sampling of every 50th individual from the list of individuals considered for promotion, and requested that the Agency provide him with current medical information for these comparator employees. But the Agency did not provide this information. The record also does not contain any statements from knowledgeable Agency officials explaining why these selection criteria accurately measure the ability of Foreign Service Officers to perform the fundamental duties of the job at the next grade level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the record has not been adequately developed to allow the Commission to rule on the selection-criteria claim, we VACATE the Agency's final decision and REMAND this matter back to the Agency to further investigate this issue, in accordance with this decision and the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that it is the complainant's disability that precludes him from meeting a legitimate qualification standard for a position does not mean the disability has to be accommodated. In fact, what it generally means is that the complainant is not a qualified individual with a disability because he cannot meet the basis qualifications for the position. For example, in <span class="Italic">Alford v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120080747 (2009), the complainant worked as a motor vehicle operator. The complainant submitted medical evidence demonstrating that because of a neck and shoulder condition, he could no longer wear a seat belt when driving. The agency promoted the complainant to the position of automotive equipment repair specialist, but informed him that he could no longer work overtime as a driver. Contending that he was denied reasonable accommodation, the Commission disagreed finding that he was not a qualified individual with a disability. In <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of analysis, we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that complainant is an individual with a disability and established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal <span id="Page_1210"></span>and race and disability discrimination. We find that the agency provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. Specifically, agency management stated that complainant could not earn overtime as a driver because he could not wear a seatbelt while driving government vehicles. We note that President Clinton's April 16, 1997 Executive Order 13043 states that "each federal employee occupying any seating position of a motor vehicle on official business, whose seat is equipped with a seat belt, shall have the seat belt properly fastened at all times when the vehicle is in motion." We further note that Department of Defense Instruction Number 6055.4 (July 20, 1999) states that all agency employees must wear safety belts while on duty status or in an agency vehicle. Additionally, 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 392.16 states that "a commercial motor vehicle which has a seat belt assembly installed at the driver's seat shall not be driven unless the driver has properly restrained himself/herself with the seat belt assembly." Complainant contends that the state of Washington permits him to drive without wearing a safety belt because of his medical condition; however, this matter is controlled by federal law, which does not allow employees to drive government vehicles without wearing a safety belt. Complainant contends that he does not have to wear a seatbelt when operating buses that have a capacity of less than 15 passengers, but the aforementioned federal regulations and policies do not mention such an exemption.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that complainant contends that the agency denied him a reasonable accommodation for his claimed disability because it did not allow him to drive an agency vehicle without wearing a seatbelt, we note that complainant must establish that he is a "qualified individual with a disability," which is defined as an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). In this case, we determine that federal regulations and policies reflect that wearing a seat belt is an essential function for operating agency vehicles. Therefore, complainant's inability to wear a seat belt while driving agency vehicles made him unqualified to drive agency vehicles. Therefore, we find that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld a medical standard for meat inspectors that required a certain level of hearing in each ear. In <span class="Italic">Mikish v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120060621 (2008), the Commission upheld the standard as job-related and consistent with business necessity and further found that the complainant would have presented a direct threat in the workplace:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency articulated that complainant is not qualified for the position because he does not meet their qualification standard of being able to hear in both ears at a 3,000 hertz, 40 decibel level. Under the Rehabilitation Act, a qualification standard, test, or other selection criteria that screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of a disability, is unlawful, unless it is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1619.10. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from job opportunities unless they are actually unable to do the job. The record reflects that this qualification standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity. The Supervisory Inspector credibly described a fast paced and chaotic industrial environment where being able to quickly notify other inspectors and employees of disease-infected meat is essential to condemning and quarantining the disease-infected meat before it is disseminated to the public. The inspectors must be able to hear other employees yelling and shouting over the loud machinery, because relying on hand motions and written communication is not efficient if the employee is not paying attention, has his back turned, or is not within a visual range. The Supervisory Inspector also testified that the Food Inspectors are often positioned in such a way that they will not be able to see hand motions and written communications. Therefore, we find the agency established that the hearing qualification standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the agency established that Food Inspectors must be able to communicate for indispensable security concerns or else they may endanger the health and safety of themselves and others. Commission regulations state that an employer may require that an individual not pose a direct threat. A "direct threat" is defined as a "significant risk of substantial harm" that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. Interpretive Guidance of Title 1 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">Echazabal v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc.</span> 536 U.S. 73 (2002); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). In order to exclude an individual on the basis of possible future injury, the agency bears the burden of showing that there is a significant risk, i.e, a high probability of substantial harm. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. The agency must show more than that an individual with a disability stands some slightly increased risk of harm. <span class="Italic">Selix v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March. 16, 2000). Moreover, such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The individual assessment must be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, industrial slaughter houses are, by their very nature, an inherently dangerous environment. Being able to alert someone of potential dangers vocally by yelling is crucial. Safety concerns described by the Supervisory Inspector include cattle breaking free and running loose, carcasses falling from overhead pulleys, and metallic shackles and chains falling from overhead. The agency's physician and Supervisory Inspector both testified that it is imperative for the safety of all employees that an individual be able to hear warnings and discern where the noise is coming from. Relying on visual hand motions and written communications is not adequate when there is a good chance such motions and writings will not be seen. Therefore, we find that a Food Inspector must be able to hear for their safety and the safety of others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that in these circumstances the hearing qualification standard for the Food Inspector position is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Additionally, we find that in these circumstances a Food Inspector who cannot hear will endanger the health and safety of himself and others. Therefore, complainant has failed to establish his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination and we AFFIRM the AJ's and agency's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employment test or criteria has the effect of disproportionately disqualified individuals with disabilities, an agency must consider whether a test or criteria accommodation can be provided that permits the agency to accurately predict the ability to perform essential job functions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0520110682 (2013), the agency used a "meet and deal" assessment of candidate for contact specialists in its call centers. The complainant, due to a traumatic brain injury, had trouble processing more than one thing at a time, below average free recall of information, and fluency problems with challenging verbal tasks. The meet and deal assessment had two components: a situational face-to-face interview and a call-in exercise where using the agency's call system the complainant had to solve a problem posed by the interviewer. The complainant requested accommodation and the agency responded by providing him with a position description and a factsheet that he could use during the simulated phone call. The complainant contended that provision of the questions in written form would have been an appropriate accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> reaffirmed its earlier decision finding that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that providing Complainant with the interview questions in written form would not have measured his ability to perform the duties of a Contact Representative. The Agency contends that immediately processing information and responding to callers are essential functions of the Contact Representative position, and its Meet and Deal assessment measures applicants' ability to perform those essential functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is correct that receiving, processing, and disseminating information in a prompt manner are essential functions of a Contact Representative position. However, these essential functions can be performed by providing Contact Representatives with questions through both written and oral means. In fact, the evidence reveals that the Agency could evaluate Complainant's ability to process and disseminate information by providing Complainant with the written form of the callers' questions via voice to text computer software. Therefore, we find that our previous decision did not err when it found that the Agency evaluated Complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of a Contact Representative position in terms that are too narrow and without regard to his ability to perform those functions with a reasonable accommodation. As such, the Agency impermissibly screened him from consideration because of his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also maintains that it would need an analog telephone line to use voice to text technology instead of the digital system it currently uses. The Agency submits a statement from its Center Director for Disability Services (CDDS) to support its contention. In the statement, the CDDS asserts that the Agency has been unable to successfully use voice to text computer software to convert to text the voices of persons the software has not been trained to recognize. The CDDS further asserts that voice to text systems that utilize third parties to convert voices to text can only be used on analog telephone lines. The CDDS states that when the Agency has provided employees with a third-party call system as a reasonable accommodation, it has provided employees with two analog telephone lines so that incoming or outgoing calls to or from the employee's telephone automatically connect to a relay operator. The CDDS states that such an arrangement could not work on its toll-free line because it is a digital system. The Agency also submits a statement from <span id="Page_1211"></span>its Executive Officer for the Office of Telephone Service that contains similar representations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we note that the Agency is essentially arguing that providing Complainant with written interview questions through voice to text technology is impractical because such technology is incompatible with its current digital telephone system. However, we note that our previous decision stated that utilizing voice to text technology was only one option the Agency could use to provide Complainant with written interview questions. We note the CDDS acknowledges that the Agency has provided employees with a reasonable accommodation that featured two analog telephone lines so that calls to or from the employee's telephone automatically connected to a relay operator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that voice to text technology and third-party relay systems will not work with its digital system. However, we find that the statements submitted by Agency employees fail to prove that voice to text technology or third-party relay cannot be configured with the Agency's telephone system. The Agency has not provided us with any persuasive evidence to support its bare assertions about the pertinent technology, such as statements from external technology experts or telephone companies. Moreover, to the extent that the Agency argues that simultaneously providing Complainant with questions in written and oral form is an undue hardship, there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that the provision of the written form of the questions would have been unduly costly, would significantly disrupt the operations of the agency, or would have fundamentally altered the nature of the Agency's operation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.(p)(2); <span class="Italic">Onyeka v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33115 (May 20, 2004) (Agency failed to prove providing reasonable accommodation of a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) for deaf employees who needed to talk to callers was an undue burden where Agency stated that TDD was "unfeasible" because of its specific telephone system configuration but provided no corroborating evidence from Georgia Relay or any other TDD provider).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that the Agency did not argue that its telephone system was incompatible with voice to text technology or third-party operator systems on appeal. Therefore, we find that the Agency cannot now belatedly introduce new evidence regarding its telephone system as a basis to reverse our previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant's request that we order the Agency to place him into the Contact Representative position, we note that victims of discrimination are entitled to "make whole relief," which has been defined as the placement of an individual in the situation he would have been in absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975). In this case, the Agency's selections were based on a Meet and Deal assessment that consisted of an interview portion and telephone role play portion. Complainant received two out of five points on his Meet and Deal assessment and was not selected because the Agency only deemed candidates who received a score of three or above as "acceptable" for selection. Because Complainant has only been assessed by the Agency without a reasonable accommodation, we cannot speculate about how he would have performed if he had been provided with the written form of the Meets and Deal questions. Consequently, Complainant must be now be assessed with regard to his performance during the Meet and Deal assessment with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the majority of the candidates who received an acceptable rating on the Meets and Deal assessment were selected for the Contact Representative position. The Agency has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that Complainant would not have been selected if it had properly provided him with a reasonable accommodation and received an acceptable rating on his assessment, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080005 (Oct. 23, 2009); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(c)(1). Consequently, we find that our previous decision did not err when it ordered the Agency to offer Complainant the position with back pay if he passes the Meet and Deal assessment with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to mount a challenge to a qualification standard, the complainant must be an individual with a disability. In finding that the complainant was not an individual with a disability because he could not pass a Power Fitness Training test, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Arnaldo C. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120121034 (2015), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is unlawful for an agency to use qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the agency, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the regulation cited above explicitly restricts coverage from unlawful qualification standards to "individuals with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities." Further, we note that in a recent discussion letter on high school diplomas as a qualification standard for students with learning disabilities, the Commission stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Thus, if an employer adopts a high school diploma requirement for a job, and that requirement "screens out an individual who is unable to graduate because of a learning disability <span class="Italic">that meets the ADA's definition of "disability,"</span> [emphasis added] the employer may not apply the standard unless it can demonstrate that the diploma requirement is job related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ADA: Qualification Standards; Disparate Impact (Nov.17, 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hence, it is clear that a complainant must show that he is an individual with a disability before he can prove that the Agency's qualification standards violated the Rehabilitation Act. Thus, Complainant cannot prevail on any of his claims that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act because he has not established that he is an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05A60898 (2006), the Commission rejected an argument that the agency could not be found liable for making an employability determination because the final authority rests with the Office of Personnel Management. In that case, the agency determined that the complainant, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, could not be employed as a sandblaster because he posed a risk to himself. The Commission overturned the agency's determination finding that there was insufficient medical evidence that the complainant's condition was a direct threat. On reconsideration, the agency argued that its determination was only a proposed finding and that, because OPM had the final determination, it could not be held liable for disability discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Smith held:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to complainant's appeal, the Commission reversed the agency's final order. Initially, the Commission's decision found that complainant was a qualified individual with a disability. In so finding, the decision noted the statements of complainant's work leader, site supervisor and two (2) of his co-workers that he could perform his duties in a satisfactory manner. Further, the Commission found that it did not agree with the agency's conclusion that hiring complainant for the Sandblaster position would have posed a direct threat to his safety or that of his co-workers. The Commission found that it did not find the agency established that the re-emergence of complainant's symptoms would have been likely or imminent had he been hired. In addition, the prior decision found that complainant's successful performance of the duties and responsibilities of his prior position as an Aircraft Worker with the Raytheon Aerospace Corporation (Raytheon) in the summer of 1999, over a period of time, was probative on the issue of whether a re-emergence of his symptoms would have been likely or imminent had he been rehired. As such, the Commission found that the agency's denial of employment to complainant violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency then filed a request for reconsideration with the Commission. In its request, the agency primarily alleged that in denying employment to complainant, it merely made a proposed decision with regard to complainant's medical suitability for the position at issue, and the proposed decision was not binding. The agency alleged that the Commission's decision found the agency liable for a decision it did not in fact make, as in fact it was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which ultimately determined whether the agency could employ complainant. In so arguing, the agency alleged that it was mandated to follow OPM's decision regarding complainant's medical suitability for the position at issue. As such, the agency argued that if the Commission's decision is sustained, the agency would be liable for a decision it had no control over. The agency alleged that OPM had the final decision authority on the legitimacy of "passing over" applicants with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more. As such, the agency alleged that the Commission's failure to address OPM's role in the instant complaint was a clearly erroneous interpretation of the law. In addition, the agency further alleges that the Commission erred in making factual findings in the instant case; as such, the Commission erroneously found that the job duties performed by complainant while he worked for Raytheon were not equivalent to the job duties of the WG-06 Equipment Cleaner (Sandblaster) position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant responded to the agency's request for reconsideration, alleging that the agency failed to show that the Commission erred in finding that the denial of employment violated the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, complainant's counsel stated that the Commission correctly placed liability on the agency for the decision to deny employment to complainant as the agency made the initial decision to disqualify him for employment. Further, complainant's counsel alleged that the Commission's prior decision did not err in finding that complainant's employment with Raytheon was equivalent to the duties and responsibilities of the position at issue with the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, the Commission finds that the agency cannot escape liability for denying employment to complainant by alleging that the ultimate decision(s) in the instant case were made by OPM. We find that the record is replete with decisions made by the agency which, considered together, <span id="Page_1212"></span>caused complainant's employment with the agency to be denied. As we stated in our previous decision, Supervisor A-l reviewed medical documents, complainant's January 1998 VA rating decision and various disability policies and rules in finding that complainant's health status was incompatible with the full range and duties for the Sandblaster position at issue. In addition, the Commission has previously held that when a government agency decides to "pass over" an applicant for a position who is a veteran, while the decision has to be sustained by OPM, the agency which makes the initial decision to deny employment is liable for any acts of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01873406 (April 26, 1988). We note that the agency argued that it was OPM, and not the agency, that took final action in the matter raised in the instant case, because OPM issued a final decision on March 29, 2001 stating that complainant was not qualified for the Sandblaster position as his medical condition presented an unacceptable safety and health risk. However, the Commission is unpersuaded by this argument. After a review of the record, the Commission determines that the agency was the catalyst in complainant's ineligibility for the subject position by determining that he failed the pre-employment medical examination and finding that his health status was incompatible with the full range and duties of the Sandblaster position in a letter from Supervisor A-l dated September 7, 2000. Moreover, we are unpersuaded by the agency's contention that it cannot be liable for violating the Rehabilitation Act by disqualifying complainant for the Sandblaster position on the grounds that the agency's actions constituted merely proposed agency actions. <span class="Italic">See Edwards v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. O1A55588 (March 2, 2006). Finally, we are not persuaded by the agency's contention that the Commission engaged in impermissible fact finding. Rather, we find that the Commission made permissible conclusions of law based on the evidence of record in finding that: (1) the essential functions of complainant's Aircraft Worker position were equivalent to those of the Sandblaster position; (2) in making their determination that complainant presented a direct threat, Doctor B and Supervisor A-l did not take into consideration the fact that he had already worked in conditions similar to the Sandblaster position during the summer of 1999; (3) hiring complainant for the Sandblaster position would not have posed a direct threat to either his safety or that of his co-workers; and (4) the statements of Doctor B were contradictory and created the appearance that the Doctor's recommendations to Supervisor A-l were not based on whether complainant's employment posed a direct threat, but rather on a concern that attempting to remove him in the future would be a problem for the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, after reconsidering the previous decision and the entire record, the Commission finds that the request fails to meet the criteria of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(b), and it is the decision of the Commission to deny the request. The decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01A40794 remains the Commission's final decision. There is no further right of administrative appeal on the decision of the Commission on this request.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Milford R. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120120081 (2015), the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment for the agency finding that the administrative judge had improperly analyzed the complainant's claim that his placement on light duty as a result of his HIV-positive status was unwarranted. In remanding the case for hearing, the Commission noted there was a question of material fact as to whether the agency's qualification standard on infectious diseases was job-related and consistent with business necessity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the course of Complainant's September 2008 examination, Complainant was asked about his medical condition and whether he was taking any medication. The record reveals that Complainant responded by disclosing his HIV status. The Agency maintains that, pursuant to its medical program, Complainant did not meet the Agency's prescribed medical standard and therefore was placed on light-duty immediately. In the instant case, we find there is a dispute in the record as to whether a simple diagnosis of HIV requires additional screening and reassignment in the absence of objective evidence that the employee was having problems performing the essential functions of the job.</p>
