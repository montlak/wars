<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Reprisal</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ADEA bars actions taken in reprisal for participating in any way in the complaint process, or for opposing practices made unlawful by the Act, though the specific language of section 633a(a) makes no mention of participation in protected activity or opposition to discriminatory employment practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ADEA does in its private sector provisions at 29 USC 623(d) provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of employees or applicants for employment...because such individual...or applicant...has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or because such individual...or applicant...has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under this Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, 623(d) of the Act does not apply to federal employees. In <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez v. Potter</span>, 128 S. Ct. 1931 (2008), discussed more fully <span class="blue">later</span>, the Supreme Court held that a prohibition against reprisal is included in the general prohibition against discrimination on the basis of age in the federal sector.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, several courts had suggested that reprisal against federal employees was not prohibited by the ADEA, but no court had actually reached such a finding. Then in <span class="Italic">Koslow v. Hundt</span>, 919 F. Supp. 18 (D.D.C. 1995), the court held that 623(d) did not apply in federal sector ADEA cases. As the court in <span class="Italic">Koslow</span>, 919 F. Supp. at 19-21, reasoned:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit unless it consents to be sued. <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. at 160, 101 S. Ct. at 2701; <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Department of Labor</span>, 41 F.3d 1551, 1555 (D.C. Cir. 1994). With the ADEA, the government has waived sovereign immunity by consenting to be sued with regard to personnel decisions that are infected with discrimination based on age. The parties disagree about whether this waiver of immunity also permits an age-related reprisal claim to be maintained against the federal government. Surprisingly, no court has ever decided this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several courts have recognized the possibility that such an action for reprisal or retaliation is not permitted by the ADEA, but for various reasons those courts have not found it necessary to resolve the issue. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Bornholdt v. Brady</span>, 869 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Muth v. Marsh</span>, 525 F. Supp. 604, 606 &#x0026; n.1 (D.D.C. 1981). Other courts, including some in this Circuit, have simply assumed that age-related retaliation claims against the federal government are actionable under the ADEA and reached decisions on the merits without any indication the issue was expressly raised at all. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schmid v. Frosch</span>, 680 F.2d 248 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Faherty v. Lockhart</span>, 751 F. Supp. 994, 1004-05 (D.D.C. 1990). <span class="Italic">See also Siegel v. Kreps</span>, 654 F.2d 773, 782-83 &#x0026; n.43 (Robinson, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When Congress amended the ADEA in 1974 to make it applicable to the federal government, it did not add the government to section 603(b)'s definition of "employers" subject to the Act. Rather, it enacted an entirely separate section relating to the federal government as employer. 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a. Thus, in seeking authority to hear a retaliation claim, the Court cannot look to section 623(d) of the Act, which expressly prohibits retaliation by "employers," since the term "employer" refers only to private employers and state and local government employers. 29 USC &#x00A7; 603(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1978, Congress further amended the Act to provide that "[a]ny personnel action of any department, agency, or other entity referred to in [29 USC 633a(a)] of this section shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter, other than the provision[ ] [establishing that all federal employees who are at least 40 years old are considered protected employees under the Act] and the provisions of this section." 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a(f). The Supreme Court has interpreted this section to mean that "federal personnel actions covered by &#x00A7; 633a] are not subject to any other section of the ADEA." <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. at 168, 101 S. Ct. at 2705.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, Congress has made clear that in interpreting section 633a, the Court may not borrow provisions from elsewhere in the ADEA. As the Second Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt v. Brady</span>, 869 F.2d at 65:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When Congress amended the ADEA in 1974 to make it applicable to the federal government, it did not merely add the government to [the] definition of employers subject to the Act.... Rather it added a relatively self-contained section, 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a, which prohibits age discrimination by the designated federal agencies.... To ensure the insularity of &#x00A7; 633a, Congress added a subsection in 1978 which...expressly forbids incorporation of any other ADEA provision into &#x00A7; 633a.... The legislative history states that &#x00A7; 633a(f) was added "to make it clear that section [633a]...is independent of any other sections of [the ADEA]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiff urges the Court to look to the interpretation afforded an almost identically worded Title VII provision that prohibits discrimination by the federal government based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). Unlike the ADEA, Title VII has been interpreted by numerous courts to waive sovereign immunity for claims of reprisal or retaliation by federal employees who file charges of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Ethnic Employees of the Library of Congress v. Boorstin</span>, 751 F.2d 1405, 1415 &#x0026; n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Porter v. Adams</span>, 639 F.2d 273, 277-78 (5th Cir. 1981)); <span class="Italic">White v. General Services Admin.</span>, 652 F.2d 913, 917 (9th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Ayon v. Sampson</span>, 547 F.2d 446, 449-50 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed strictly and may not be inferred or implied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 318, 106 S. Ct. 2957, 2963, 92 L. Ed.2d 250 (1986); <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Department of Labor</span>, 41 F.3d at 1555. The Court may not find a waiver unless the intent of Congress is "unequivocally expressed" in the relevant statute. <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S. Ct. 1349, 1351-52, 63 L. Ed.2d 607 (1980) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. King</span>, 395 U.S. 1, 89 S. Ct. 1501, 23 L. Ed.2d 52 (1969)). As our court of appeals said in <span class="Italic">Dorsey</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The federal government's waiver of sovereign immunity must be "unequivocally expressed" and the statutory provision containing the expression must "establish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims."...While private rights of actions may be implied, waivers of sovereign immunity may not. The Supreme Court has said exactly that, and on more than one occasion: "A waiver of sovereign immunity 'cannot be implied.'..."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Department of Labor</span>, 41 F.3d at 1555 (quoting, <span class="Italic">inter alia, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990))<span class="Italic">. See United States v. Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. 30, 33-34, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 1014-15, 117 L. Ed.2d 181 (1992). The Supreme Court "has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied." <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. at 161, 101 S. Ct. at 2701-02 (quotations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While some have argued that retaliation claims under Title VII do not meet these stringent tests for the waiver of sovereign immunity, our court of appeals and others expressly have consistently held that Title VII proscribes retaliation by the federal government as employer. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ethnic Employees of the Library of Congress v. Boorstin</span>, 751 F.2d at 1415 &#x0026; n.13; <span class="Italic">Ayon v. Sampson</span>, 547 F.2d at 449-50. The same is not true with respect to the ADEA. Section 633a contains a general proscription against age discrimination, but does not mention retaliation or reprisal. By contrast, the ADEA provisions relating to private employees and employees of state and local governments expressly provide for age-related retaliation claims. 29 USC &#x00A7; 623(d). A general proscription against discrimination based on age does not unequivocally express Congressional intent to prohibit retaliation, which derives from different biases and discriminatory motives than age itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts often rely upon the many distinctions between the ADEA and Title VII, declining to judicially import the unique aspects of one into the other. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.</span>, 499 U.S. 244, 256, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 1234-35, 113 L. Ed.2d 274 (1991). In particular, with respect to retaliation claims, there is one striking, indeed crucial, difference between the statutes. The Title VII provisions relating to discrimination by the federal government do not include an exclusivity provision. In fact, section 2000e-16(d) of the Title VII provision concerning the federal government directs the Court to the general Title VII sections governing remedies, including those for retaliation<span class="Italic">. Ayon v. Sampson</span>, 547 F.2d at 449. The ADEA by contrast has an express exclusivity provision. Thus, in enacting the ADEA, Congress not only did not expressly waive sovereign immunity with respect to retaliation claims, it clearly declined to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it may seem anomalous to protect private and not federal employees from retaliation under the ADEA, or to permit people to complain about discrimination but not to prohibit conduct that might inhibit such complaints, it is the job of Congress and not this Court to correct any perceived incongruity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. Department of Treasury</span>, 920 F. Supp. 4 (D.D.C. 1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 167 F.3d 612 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez v. Potter</span>, 476 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2007), the U.S. Court of Appeals held that the ADEA does not prohibit retaliation against federal workers for engaging in protected activity under the ADEA. Commenting on a holding to the contrary in <span class="Italic">Forman v. Small</span>, 271 F.3d 285 (D.C. Cir. 2001), the court in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must respectfully disagree with our brethren on the D.C. Circuit. <span id="Page_1439"></span>First, we note that the proper inquiry is not whether the statute shows that Congress intended to limit the scope of &#x00A7; 633a, but rather whether Congress intended to provide for a retaliation cause of action in &#x00A7; 633a in the first place. <span class="Italic">See Iverson v. City of Boston</span>, 452 F.3d 94, 100 (1st Cir. 2006) ("[A] private right of action may be conceived only by a statute that clearly evinces congressional intent to bestow such a right."). Furthermore, although <span class="Italic">Forman</span> relied heavily on the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 101 S. Ct. 2698, 69 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1981), <span class="Italic">Lehman</span> expressly adopted the reasoning we apply here, that "Congress...demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right...when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very 'legislation cited.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 162. Finally, we disagree with the D.C. Circuit's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Forman</span> that the similarities between the provisions affecting federal employees in the ADEA and Title VII justify a finding that &#x00A7; 633a contains a retaliation provision. Although we acknowledge that &#x00A7; 633a is "patterned directly after &#x00A7; 717(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964," <span class="Italic">Lehman</span>, 453 U.S. at 167 n.15, we see a significant difference between the two statutes. In Title VII, Congress intended for 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, the provision applicable to federal employees, to incorporate the provisions applicable to the private sector, including the private-sector anti-retaliation provision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ayon v. Sampson</span>, 547 F.2d 446, 450 (9th Cir. 1976) ("[I]t is clear that Congress incorporated the [private-sector] protections against retaliation in its enactment of &#x00A7; 2000e-16."). In stark contrast, the provisions of the ADEA that apply to federal employees state that "[a]ny personnel action of any department, agency, or other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this Chapter." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(f). The court in <span class="Italic">Forman</span> stated that &#x00A7; 633a(f) presents "somewhat of a red herring." 271 F.3d at 298. However, we generally engage the presumption that statutes do not contain surplusage. <span class="Italic">Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy</span>, 126 S. Ct. 2455, 2460, 165 L. Ed. 2d 526 (2006). Here, it is quite easy to see why Congress might have included &#x00A7; 633a(f) in the ADEA: it did not want the expansive private-sector provisions of the ADEA extended to federal employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lehman</span>, 453 U.S. at 162 (finding that Congress did not intend for &#x00A7; 626(c), which provides for jury trials in private-sector age discrimination suits, to apply to federal employees); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 168 ("[Section 633a(f)] clearly emphasized that [&#x00A7; 633a] was self-contained and unaffected by other sections, including those governing procedures applicable in actions against private employers"); <span class="Italic">Nowd</span>, 76 F.3d at 28 (deciding that &#x00A7; 626(b), which provides for the recovery of attorneys fees in private-sector age discrimination suits, does not apply to federal employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez v. Potter</span>, 128 S. Ct. 1931 (2008), and reversed the First Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The federal-sector provision of the ADEA provides that "[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." &#x00A7; 633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The key question in this case is whether the statutory phrase "discrimination based on age" includes retaliation based on the filing of an age discrimination complaint. We hold that it does.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by our prior decisions interpreting similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes. In <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc</span>., 396 U.S. 229, 90 S. Ct. 400, 24 L. Ed.2d 386 (1969), we considered whether a claim of retaliation could be brought under Rev. Stat. &#x00A7; 1978, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1982, which provides that "[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right...as is enjoyed by white citizens...to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property." While &#x00A7; 1982 does not use the phrase "discrimination based on race," that is its plain meaning. <span class="Italic">See Tennessee v. Lane</span>, 541 U.S. 509, 561, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed.2d 820 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (describing &#x00A7; 1982 as "banning public or private racial discrimination in the sale and rental of property"); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co</span>., 392 U.S. 409, 88 S. Ct. 2186, 20 L. Ed.2d 1189 (1968).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, a white man (Sullivan) held membership shares in a nonstock corporation that operated a park and playground for residents of the area in which he owned a home. Under the bylaws of the corporation, a member who leased a home in the area could assign a membership share in the corporation. But when Sullivan rented his house and attempted to assign a membership share to an African-American (Freeman), the corporation disallowed the assignment because of Freeman's race and subsequently expelled Sullivan from the corporation for protesting that decision. Sullivan sued the corporation, and we held that his claim that he had been expelled "for the advocacy of Freeman's cause" was cognizable under &#x00A7; 1982. 396 U.S., at 237, 90 S. Ct. 400. A contrary holding, we reasoned, would have allowed Sullivan to be "punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities" and would have given "impetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed</span>., 544 U.S. 167, 125 S. Ct. 1497, 161 L. Ed.2d 361 (2005), we relied on <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> in interpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1681 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Jackson, a public school teacher, sued his school board under Title IX, "alleging that the Board retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school's athletic program." 544 U.S., at 171, 125 S. Ct. 1497. Title IX provides in relevant part that "[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,...be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." &#x00A7; 1681(a) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added). Holding that this provision prohibits retaliation, we wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Retaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination.... Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It is a form of 'discrimination' because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment. Moreover, retaliation is discrimination 'on the basis of sex' because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination. We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional 'discrimination' 'on the basis of sex,' in violation of Title IX." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 173-174, 125 S. Ct. 1497 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This interpretation, we found, flowed naturally from <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>: "Retaliation for Jackson's advocacy of the rights of the girls' basketball team in this case is 'discrimination' 'on the basis of sex,' just as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of a black lessee in Sullivan was discrimination on the basis of race." 544 U.S., at 176-177, 125 S. Ct. 1497.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> and <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, we interpret the ADEA federal-sector provision's prohibition of "discrimination based on age" as likewise proscribing retaliation. The statutory language at issue here ("discrimination based on age") is not materially different from the language at issue in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> ("'discrimination'" "'on the basis of sex'") and is the functional equivalent of the language at issue in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, <span class="Italic">see Jackson, supra,</span> at 177, 125 S. Ct. 1497 (describing <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> as involving "discrimination on the basis of race"). And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases; that is, all three cases involve remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> dissent strenuously argued that a claim of retaliation is conceptually different from a claim of discrimination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 544 U.S., at 184-185, 125 S. Ct. 1497 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), but that view did not prevail. And respondent in this case does not ask us to overrule <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> or <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>. Nor does respondent question the reasoning of those decisions. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the Government contended that "[t]he text...of Title IX demonstrate[s] that it encompasses protection against retaliation" since "retaliation against a person because that person has filed a sex discrimination complaint is a form of intentional sex discrimination." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 8, in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,</span> O.T.2004, No. 02-1672. Similarly, in another case this Term, the Government has urged us to follow the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> and to hold that a claim of retaliation may be brought under Rev. Stat. &#x00A7; 1977, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981. In that case, the Government argues that &#x00A7; 1981's prohibition of "'discrimination'...quite naturally includes discrimination on account of having complained about discrimination." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 10, in <span class="Italic">CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries</span>, O.T. 2007, No. 06-1431.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision of the Court of Appeals, which respondent defends, perceived a "clear difference between a cause of action for discrimination and a cause of action for retaliation" and sought to distinguish Jackson on three grounds. 476 F.3d, at 58-59. We are not persuaded, however, by any of these attempted distinctions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission recognized the anomaly in the ADEA much earlier. Its response was that for federal employees, reprisal on the basis of age was prohibited by EEOC regulations at 29 CFR 1613.262(a) and 1613.511. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01873297 (1988). The current regulations also prohibit reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.101(b); 29 CFR 1614.103(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 15(a) of the ADEA states that all federal employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age shall be made free from discrimination based on age. We note that Section 15(a) does not specifically define "discrimination based on age." However, Section 4 of the ADEA specifies those acts by an employer which are unlawful under the Act. Included in Section 4 is a provision which prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee who has filed an age discrimination complaint. Specifically, Section 4(d) states that it shall be unlawful to discriminate against employees or applicants for employment because they participated in an investigation, proceeding or litigation under the ADEA, or opposed any practice made unlawful under the ADEA. The Commission looks to Section 4 of the ADEA to identify the acts made unlawful under the ADEA for federal employees and agencies. According to Section 4(d) of the Act, discrimination under the ADEA includes reprisal discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent">Following the decisions in <span class="Italic">Koslow</span> and <span class="Italic">Tomasello</span>, however, the Commission revisited the issue in a series of decisions in early 1997. The result of that <span id="Page_1440"></span>reexamination was reflected in <span class="Italic">Gorman v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01966769 (1997). The Commission held that the ADEA did, in fact, contain a statutory prohibition of reprisal. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Gorman</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency cited <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. Department of Treasury</span>, 920 Fed. Supp. 4 (1996), in support of its dismissal of appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim, on the grounds that the ADEA did not create a reprisal claim against Federal employers. In <span class="Italic">Tomasello</span>, the District Court found that when Congress expanded the scope of the ADEA in 1974, to include state, local and Federal government employees, state and local governments were added as potential defendants by a simple expansion of the term "employer" in the ADEA; and that in contrast, Congress added an entirely new section (29 USC &#x00A7; 633a) to address problems of age discrimination in Federal employment. The District Court further found that the ADEA was amended again in 1978, to provide that "[a]ny personnel action of any department, agency, or other entity referred to in [29 USC &#x00A7; 633a(a)] of this section shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter, other than the provisions of section 631(b) of this title and the provisions of this section." 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a(f). Moreover, the District Court found that in <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156 (1981), the Supreme Court concluded that section 633a(f) indicates that Federal actions covered by 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a are not subject to any other sections of the ADEA. The District Court in <span class="Italic">Tomasello</span> noted that 29 USC &#x00A7; 623(d) expressly establishes a retaliation claim against "employers" which the ADEA defines as private, state, and local government employers, but that section 633a does not include a reference to a claim for retaliation or reprisal against Federal employers. The District Court concluded that in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Lehman</span>, section 623(d) cannot be interpreted as creating, even implicitly, a retaliation claim against Federal employers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that the issue addressed in the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Lehman</span> is distinguishable from the issue addressed in the instant complaint. In <span class="Italic">Lehman</span>, a Federal employee brought suit in Federal District Court against the Department of the Navy under 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a(c), alleging violation of the ADEA and demanding a jury trial. The Supreme Court determined that section 633a(c) does not evince a congressional intent that ADEA plaintiffs who proceed to trial against the Federal Government may do so before a jury. The Supreme Court noted, moreover, that section 633a(f) clearly emphasized that section 633a was self-contained and unaffected by other sections of the ADEA, including those governing procedures applicable in actions against private employers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant complaint, in contrast, does not address merely the nature of the civil action available to an aggrieved person who pursues a claim of discrimination in a Federal district court, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether or not a jury trial is available. Instead, the instant complaint addresses whether or not covered personnel who have opposed a practice made unlawful by the ADEA or have participated in the administrative or judicial proceedings under the ADEA are protected from retaliation. The Commission finds that it may be inferred that the breadth of language of section 633a, requiring that Federal government employment decisions affecting covered personnel "be free from any discrimination based on age" (emphasis added) is sufficiently broad to prohibit age-related retaliation. Moreover, we determine that an interpretation of section 633a that would merely recognize freedom from discrimination based upon age, but does not provide for freedom from retaliatory measures taken for opposing any practice made unlawful by the ADEA, would be contrary to the mission of the Commission. We therefore determine that appellant properly raised reprisal as a basis in his formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mikus v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01966757 (1997); <span class="Italic">Beitler v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01971751 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the EEOC also relies upon its own regulation in finding that reprisal against federal employees under the ADEA is prohibited, it is not likely to change its position unless the Supreme Court upholds the First Circuit in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>. Depending on which way <span class="Italic">Gomez-</span>Perez goes, the case also raises the argument for an even narrower interpretation of the ban on age discrimination in the federal sector. The EEOC routinely interprets the ADEA as applying to all personnel actions, as well as the terms, conditions and privileges of employment reasoning that Congress intended the ban on age discrimination to be analogous to the ban on discrimination in Title VII. However, the precise language of &#x00A7; 633a(a) is that "[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." The provision makes no mention of the terms, conditions or privileges of employment and it can be argued that the strict interpretation of the provision, if adopted by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, leaves no room for an expansive reading of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though attorney fees are recoverable in reprisal actions based on Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act for work in the administrative process, they cannot be recovered in a complaint alleging reprisal under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">Phillips, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The reprisal analysis under the ADEA closely parallels that utilized in Title VII cases and is addressed more fully in the following chapter.</p>
