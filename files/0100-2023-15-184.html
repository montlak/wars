<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-182"><span class="space">1.</span> Regulating Conduct of Hearing</h4>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge has wide discretion in regulating the conduct of the hearing. This extends to ordering an appellant to proceed without her attorney if he is not present at the start of the hearing, and determining the order of witnesses. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 01841591 (1986). In that case, the appellant was required to proceed with her technical advisor as her representative when the employee's counsel had not appeared for the hearing. The judge then ordered the representative to call the appellant as the first witness, against the representative's desires. The judge also ordered the representative to call other witnesses when the witnesses the agency was ordered to produce were not present at the time the representative desired to call them. Noting that it is the responsibility of the administrative judge to see that the hearing proceeds without undue delay, the Commission found that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of not being allowed to call witnesses in her preferred order.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission may have been right in the <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> decision to conclude that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the judge's rulings. However, because the appellant has the burden of proof, the appellant should be allowed to dictate the order of the presentation of evidence in the manner he or she believes will most effectively present the case, unless the appellant is unreasonable in refusing to accommodate the schedules of witnesses. It is often possible to take a witness out of the "preferred order" without any impact on the presentation of a case. Both employees and agencies should be willing to do so when the witness has legitimate schedule conflicts that can be addressed through this type of courtesy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judge also ordered that the appellant testify first, stating that "the Complainant is always the first witness to lay the basis of the allegation so that both parties have an opportunity to proceed based upon what she states." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There is no hard and fast rule requiring a complainant to testify first. In most cases, it is likely that an orderly presentation of the case will require that the employee testify first. But the hearing is an extension of the investigation. A substantial record exists prior to the hearing and both parties, as well as the judge, should be familiar with the record before the hearing. Any assertion of a requirement that the employee testify first in order to lay a foundation for other witnesses is misplaced. As a final comment, there appears no excuse in the record for the tardiness of the appellant's representative. Likewise, there is no indication as to why the witnesses the agency was ordered to produce were not present when originally called. The agency has an obligation to produce witnesses who <span id="Page_539"></span>are agency employees and an administrative judge should not penalize an appellant when the agency fails in discharging that obligation, absent a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further confirming an AJ's wide discretion in regulating the conduct of the hearing, in <span class="Italic">Agnus W. v. Attorney General</span>, 2021003455 (2022), the Commission approved of the AJ's reliance on joint stipulations that "should have been agreed to" but were not and taking over direct examination of witnesses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant argues that the AJ abused their discretion by admitting and basing their findings in part on a joint stipulation of facts that was not actually joint. Complainant also argues that the AJ erred and abused their discretion in relying on this joint stipulation while stripping Complainant's counsel of his full right and ability to call witnesses and cross examine fully the Agency witnesses called.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in Complainant's brief, her attorney cited to the hearing transcript. The cited portion of the transcript states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Finally, the Judge expects full execution of the stipulations that should have been agreed to and filed last Friday. And because neither part has assisted the Judge with classic filings or an exhibit on pecuniary damages, [as] the Judge urged it would have been helpful rather than the filing of unnecessary stipulation objections and proposed findings, for [sic] both lawyers should be stepping up their game, reaching reasonable agreements, and filing proposed findings. This is further justification for the Judge to take over majority control of the hearing and the examination of parties' witnesses. This Judge has only had to do this in one other case much worse than this in which the parties' very fine lawyers didn't even agree to one stipulation. So while you will be allowed examination use of your witness folders, you're not going to be allowed to control your direct examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the preceding lines, the AJ notes that "because there have been delays due to communication failures and back-and-forth of questioning, you're going to be restricted to direct, a cross, and one redirect."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, it appears that Complainant's attorney engaged in a pattern of disruptive or inefficient behavior throughout the discovery process. All representatives, non-attorneys as well as attorneys, "have a particular responsibility to respect the order and authority of the EEO process." EEO MD-110 at Chap. 7, &#x00A7; V.A. Complainant's representative has not done so. As such, we find no issue with the AJ's decision prior to the hearing to limit attorney involvement in order to preserve the hearing process. In reaching this determination, we recognize a complainant's right to strong and effective advocacy as well as the hearing process's need for proper demeanor and appropriate behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the AJ has broad discretion throughout the discovery and hearing processes. Here, it appears that the hearing was able to be conducted, and we find that the limited role of Complainant's attorney was at worst harmless. Regarding Complainant's contention that the facts were not jointly stipulated, the Exhibit 1, Joint Stipulations, relied upon by the AJ, appears to be signed by Complainant's attorney. It is not apparent that the stipulations were misrepresented, nor improperly relied upon by the AJ. Moreover, the AJ was able to make their own credibility determinations at the hearing, as well as ask clarifying questions of witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the hearing transcript, the AJ decision, the numerous motions throughout the record, and the record as a whole, we find that the substantial evidence support the AJ's decision. We note that the AJ's decision accurately recounted the relevant material facts and identified the legal standard for their decision. The AJ held a hearing, examined and considered witnesses, as well as Complainant's testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Agency's final order adopting the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge does not commit reversible error when he permits the agency to call a witness out of turn prior to the conclusion of the complainant's case. <span class="Italic">Simon v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890464 (1990). The complainant made no showing that he was not permitted to present any relevant evidence as a result of the judge's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Alfonso v. Attorney General</span>, 01A11230 (2002), the Commission rejected arguments by the complainant that the administrative judge improperly limited his examination and, therefore, deprived him of an opportunity to rehabilitate his credibility. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Alfonso</span> held the judge was within his authority in regulating the conduct of the hearing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The hearing was held on May 16, 17, and 19, 2000. Ten witnesses testified at the hearing. Complainant testified on direct for approximately 70 pages and was cross-examined for approximately 150 pages. Complainant testified last, and at the conclusion of complainant's cross-examination, the AJ stated that she believed that would conclude the questioning process, and stated, as she previously had indicated, that she did not need redirect or re-cross examination of complainant, as it had seemed like everything had been gone through. When complainant's representative requested the opportunity to have redirect examination of complainant because of credibility concerns, he submitted that he might be able do it in his closing statement. During his closing, complainant's representative pointed out matters in the record which supported complainant's credibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding complainant's contention on appeal that the AJ's credibility determinations were inappropriate because complainant's ability to rehabilitate his credibility was truncated, the Commission notes that an EEOC AJ has broad discretion in the conduct of a hearing, including the amount of time expended examining witnesses. 29 C.F.R. 1614.109; <span class="Italic">Blakemore v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972875 (March 17, 1999). Our review in this case does not indicate a basis upon which to reject the credibility determinations or the AJ's decision finding no discrimination. In general, the Commission will not disturb the credibility determinations of an AJ when, as here, such determinations are based on the AJ's observations of the demeanor of the witnesses<span class="Italic">. Esquer v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960096 (September 6, 1996); <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900589 (July 26, 1990). Our review does not reveal any evidence that the AJ exceeded her authority or abused her discretion in the conduct of the hearing. We find no abuse of the AJ's discretion in limiting complainant's testimony to direct and cross-examination. Finally, while complainant did not make a proffer about what he would have testified to during redirect examination, he did discuss issues concerning complainant's credibility in his closing statement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Potter-Clark v. Postmaster General</span>, 01891606 (1989), the Commission rejected allegations that the agency interfered with the administrative judge's authority to regulate the conduct of a hearing by insisting that the hearing not go beyond 4:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to avoid paying overtime to the complainant and other witnesses. The Commission specifically did not rule that an objection to paying overtime is a legitimate reason to restrict the judge's ability to regulate the hearing. However, from the record, it appears that all testimony was completed within the time limit set by the agency and that the appellant suffered no harm as a result of the hearing deadline.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge may cancel a hearing where, after repeated warnings, a complainant fails to cooperate. In <span class="Italic">Kien v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01950400 (1996), the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant had repeatedly been advised, in Commission correspondence as well as in Commission decisions, that EEOC Regulations do not provide for the consolidation of complaints filed against different agencies. Moreover, the matter of appellant's termination from the Navy had been addressed by the Navy, the MSPB, and the Commission in final decisions issued by these agencies. Appellant, however, persisted in his attempts to reopen the issue of his Navy removal during the pre-hearing conferences for the instant complaint. Despite repeated warnings by the AJ, appellant continued to manifest his opposition to proceed with the hearing on the issues specified in the Commission's previous Order. We find that under the unique facts of this case, the AJ properly exercised his discretion and canceled the hearing based on appellant's failure to cooperate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we note that appellant's other EEO complaints filed with the agency concern agency actions unrelated to the withdrawal of the job offer for the Inspector Position. Therefore, we find that the agency properly declined to consolidate the February 1986 complaint with appellant's other EEO complaints.</p>
