<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-65"><span class="space">2.</span> Reasonable Accommodation Cases</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has also treated failure to make reasonable accommodation cases as systemic or recurring violations, though it has sometimes characterized them as continuing violations, holding that a new violation occurs every day the failure exists. <span class="Italic">Ware v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956791 (1996). Other Commission cases frame it as a violation of the agency's ongoing duty to reasonably accommodate that continues for as long as the agency remains unwilling to provide the necessary accommodation. <span class="Italic">Shanta S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120151257 (2017). As long as contact with a counselor is made within 45 days of the agency's continuing alleged failure to accommodate, the contact is timely. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz v. Postmaster General,</span> 05990136 (2000) (complainant raised an ongoing series of denials of interpretive services which included a specific most recent designated incident); <span class="Italic">Harman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01973219 (1998) ("[F]ailure to accommodate may constitute a recurring violation, that is, a violation that recurs anew each day that an employer fails to provide an accommodation.")<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120054460 (2008); <span class="Italic">Torruellas v. Postmaster General</span>, <span id="Page_97"></span>01962347 (1996). Explicit denial of an accommodation request is not required. A simple failure to act on the request is deemed by the Commission as a denial. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120130676 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> or <span class="Italic">Ledbetter</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, did not address the timeliness of reasonable accommodation claims. However, a clear trend has emerged from the Commission's own decisions regarding the timeliness of reasonable accommodation claims. Stated succinctly, the Commission's more recent case law holds that a complaint for failure to accommodate remains timely as long as the agency has not acted to deny the request. However, the complainant has 45 days from the denial of a request for reasonable accommodation to initiate counseling. If counseling is not initiated within the 45 days, the complaint is untimely. The complainant can, in a manner, revive the claim by requesting accommodation again and timely initiating counselor contact after a subsequent denial. The initial claim remains untimely and no relief can be granted with respect to that denial, but the untimely claim does not forever bar the complainant from seeking accommodation and challenging any further denial of the request.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-11-054.html#sec2-54">The Supreme Court's View<span class="Italic">--Morgan</span></a>," the Court, in analyzing the timeliness issues in that case, focused on defining the nature of the alleged "unlawful employment practice" advanced by a complainant to determine timeliness. Although the EEOC, as discussed further below, has yet to define the precise nature of the "unlawful employment practice" in a failure to accommodate case, it did provide considerable insight into that analysis in <span class="Italic">Hackney v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120093106 (2011). In that case, the complainant alleged that on December 3, 2007, the agency discriminated against him on the basis of disability when it assigned him work duties outside of his physician's restrictions. The agency dismissed the complaint for untimely counselor contact, which was initiated on May 23, 2008. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hackney</span>, reversed the agency's decision noting that the complaint was properly characterized as one of failure to accommodate and, because the need for accommodation was ongoing, the counselor contact was in fact timely. In doing so, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hackney</span>, had the following to say about failure to accommodate as unlawful employment practice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, it is significant to note that the variety of matters raised by Complainant address the issue of an ongoing reasonable accommodation denial. Because an employer has an ongoing obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation, failure to provide such an accommodation constitutes a violation each time the employee needs it. <span class="Italic">See</span> "Threshold Issues," EEOC Compliance Manual, at 2-73 (Revised July 21, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has held that a Complainant alleging a hostile work environment will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one falls within the filing period. <span class="Italic">See National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</span> 122 S. Ct. 2061 (June 10, 2002). This principle applies to this case as it is clear that Complainant initiated contact with an EEO Counselor within the regulatory time frame, at a minimum, in regard to the above referenced reasonable accommodation issue. As this matter was timely raised with an EEO Counselor, the other incidents of alleged harassment identified by Complainant will be construed as timely raised with an EEO Counselor as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claims, in essence that he was subjected to discrimination when the Agency assigned him work duties outside his doctor's work restrictions. In his formal complaint, Complainant stated that he was initially assigned all duties at the passenger screening checkpoint, however, his immediate supervisor "saw the error in this and I was limited to performing the TSA Passenger Screening Checkpoint Duties of Exit Lane Monitor and Travel Document Checker (TDC). I was routinely assigned to perform these duties simultaneously, which not only violated my restrictions and limitations, but also one excluded performing the other properly." We find that because Complainant is alleging an ongoing violation of his reasonable accommodation requests, we find that his May 23, 2008 EEO Counselor contact was not untimely with regard to the claims alleging denial of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Peacock v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120082372 (July 31, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">That analysis, defining a failure to accommodate as a series of events that taken together constitute one unlawful employment practice, is consistent with the trend in Commission cases noted above.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Kirksey v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A22295 (2003), the Commission held that a reasonable accommodation claim was time-barred where it was brought more than 45 days after denial of accommodation. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Coddington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A40149 (2004), the Commission found that a claim of denial of reasonable accommodation was a recurring violation with a new statute of limitations starting each day that accommodation was not granted. In that case, the Commission specifically noted that the complainant was never advised by the agency that his request for accommodation was denied. But, the agency had not granted the request within 45 days of the initiation of counseling. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Handy v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A43721_r.txt">01A43721</a> (2004) (holding counselor contact was timely where alleged work assignments outside of the complainant's medical restrictions occurred within 45 days of initiation of counseling).</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the trend that is emerging from these cases is that a complaint over failure to provide reasonable accommodation will be deemed untimely where the agency makes a determination not to provide an accommodation and communicates that determination to the complainant but counseling is not initiated within 45 days. In cases where the agency does not make such a determination or does not communicate that determination to the complainant, a complaint over failure to provide reasonable accommodation remains timely. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bergman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61204 (2006), the Commission, referring to the claim as one of a "recurring violation," found the complaint was timely where the complainant alleged that the agency simply ignored his requests for reasonable accommodation. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Sipple v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A43420_r.txt">01A43420</a> (2004), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In dismissing the complaint, the agency noted that complainant had been accommodated by working four hours daily since March 17, 2003, and that complainant was offered a full eight-hour limited duty assignment, effective October 4, 2003. The agency stated that complainant should have suspected discrimination when he was offered the limited duty assignment. The agency further stated that complainant should have contacted an EEO Counselor within 45 days of October 7, 2003, the date when the agency stated that it denied reasonable accommodation by informing complainant that he was not to report to work. The agency concluded that when complainant contacted an EEO Counselor on December 18, 2003, his contact was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant asserts that because the agency Injury Compensation Specialist assured him repeatedly that he would be accommodated and compensated he was misled into delaying EEO Counselor contact until December 18, 2003, when it became apparent to him that something was amiss.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(l) requires that complaints of discrimination should be brought to the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor within forty-five (45) days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within forty-five (45) days of the effective date of the action. The Commission has adopted a "reasonable suspicion" standard (as opposed to a "supportive facts" standard) to determine when the forty-five (45) day limitation period is triggered. <span class="Italic">See Howard v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970852 (February 11, 1999). Thus, the time limitation is not triggered until a complainant reasonably suspects discrimination, but before all the facts that support a charge of discrimination have become apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulations also provide that the agency or the Commission shall extend the time limits when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that he or she did not know and reasonably should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting the EEO Counselor within the time limits, or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency or the Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2). The time limits are also subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that on March 17, 2003, after surgery for a work injury, complainant returned to work in a limited duty assignment with restrictions. In a September 29, 2003 letter, the Injury Compensation Specialist informed complainant that he was to begin a new limited duty assignment which changed complainant's usual work restrictions. The new assignment was to begin on October 4, 2003. The record reveals that complainant signed a rejection of the assignment on October 3, 2003. The record further reveals that on October 6, 2003, complainant, who was still working in the limited duty assignment that he had returned to after the surgery, was directed by his manager not to report to work until his restrictions and job assignment could be clarified. In an October 29, 2003 letter to complainant, the Injury Compensation Specialist noted that complainant had declined the limited duty assignment and that he was being provided with another limited duty assignment with an effective date of November 1, 2003. The record reveals that complainant received the October 29, 2003 letter on October 31, 2003, and accepted the alternative limited duty assignment "under protest" on November 3, 2003. The record further reveals that complainant did not work for the agency from October 7, 2003, until his return on November 5, 2003. The record discloses that complainant initiated EEO Counselor contact on December 18, 2003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency's dismissal of the complaint was proper and that complainant has not provided justification sufficient to extend the time period. Complainant knew by October 3, 2003, that the agency had denied him an accommodation by changing his assignment. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A34361 (February 19, 2004). However, complainant continued to work in his usual <span id="Page_98"></span>limited duty assignment through October 6, 2003. We find therefore that complainant had 45 days therefrom to initiate EEO Counselor contact. Accordingly, when complainant contacted the EEO Counselor on December 18, 2003, the contact was beyond the requisite time period and therefore untimely. The Commission is not persuaded that the agency misled complainant such that complainant delayed initiating contact. Complainant's informal efforts to obtain an accommodation within his restrictions did not toll the time period for timely contact. The Commission has consistently held that utilization of internal agency procedures, union grievances, and other remedial processes does not toll the time limit for contacting an EEO Counselor. <span class="Italic">See Hosford v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05890038 (June 9, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lovett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A62215 (2006) (complaint untimely where there was no allegation of an ongoing need for accommodation and no explanation of why complainant waited almost eight months from latest denial to initiate counseling); <span class="Italic">Doyle v. Attorney General</span>, 01A33236 (2004) (complainant should have reasonably suspected discrimination when her supervisor told her to return to work and purchase requested protective equipment from a drug store); <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A42254_r.txt">01A42254</a> (2004) (counselor contact untimely where it occurred more than 45 days after agency denied complainant use of scooter).</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to the <span class="Italic">Sipple</span> case is <span class="Italic">Tenneboe v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520090426 (2009). In <span class="Italic">Tenneboe</span>, the complainant's job was changed as the result of a fitness-for-duty examination and he was placed on light duty with a new schedule and different physical requirements. The record is unclear as to when the complainant requested accommodation, but the agency did not deny the request until several months after his reassignment. The complainant contacted an EEO counselor within days of the denial. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the 45 days should be counted from the initial reassignment and held that counselor contact was timely where it had occurred within 45 days of the denial of accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">McGreevy v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A43361_r.txt">01A43361</a> (2004), the Commission reversed a final agency decision dismissing the complaint for untimely counselor contact where the complainant contacted a counselor on July 16, 2003, alleging an ongoing failure to accommodate since November 12, 2002. The Commission in <span class="Italic">McGreevy</span> noted there is "no evidence that complainant's request for an accommodation was expressly denied." As a result, "[b]ecause the record does not establish that the agency specifically denied complainant's requests for reasonable accommodation thereby triggering the time limit for timely EEO Counselor contact, we find the complainant's requests constitute a recurring violation and, therefore, the complainant's EEO Counselor contact was timely." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45428 (2005) (denial of light duty as accommodation claim timely where filed where agency had not acted on request, even though claim of sex discrimination based on same request was untimely because not made within 45 days of request); <span class="Italic">Hovell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A43005.txt">01A43005</a> (2004) ("[T]he Commission initially notes that failure to address a request for reasonable accommodation constitutes a recurring violation that repeats each day that the accommodation is not provided.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kirkland v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a42874.txt">01A42874</a> (2005), the Commission found the complaint was not time-barred where the agency had never expressly denied the requested accommodation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Review of the record and complainant's complaint indicates that complainant viewed the incidents giving rise to her complaint as a failure by the agency to grant a reasonable accommodation, to include an accommodation to allow her to perform her duties in the Claims Assistant position or a reassignment. In addition, the record reveals that management never definitively granted or denied complainant's request for a reasonable accommodation. Based upon these circumstances, the Commission finds that this matter constitutes a recurring violation, that is, a violation that recurs anew each day that an employer fails to provide an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934120 (March 4, 1994). Because the agency's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is ongoing, and because complainant was never put on notice that her request was denied, the Commission finds that complainant's EEO Counselor contact was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sveska v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073119 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant's reasonable accommodation claims were timely where the agency had repeatedly ignored his requests for a vehicle with an automatic transmission. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Sveska</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that a review of the record reflects that complainant made several requests for an automatic transmission as a reasonable accommodation but that management purportedly ignored his requests. This claim must be characterized as a recurring violation. Specifically, the EEOC's Compliance Manual, Section 2, "Threshold Issues," p. 2-73, EEOC Notice 915.003 (July 21, 2005), provides that "because" an employer has an ongoing obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation, failure to provide such accommodation constitutes a violation each time the employee needs it." Furthermore, the Commission has specifically held that the denial of a reasonable accommodation constitutes a recurring violation that repeats each time the accommodation is needed. <span class="Italic">See Harmon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980365 (November 4, 1999). Therefore, viewed as a recurring violation, we find that complainant's EEO Counselor contact is timely, and that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint on the alternative grounds of untimely EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">Bucking the trend in these recent cases is <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120122977 (2014), where the Commission found that counselor contact occurring on January 20, 2012 was timely even though the denial of accommodation occurred on November 10, 2011, and was outside of the 45-day limit for counselor contact. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency issued its decision dismissing the complaint, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2). The Agency noted that Complainant alleged that she was discriminated against on November 10, 2011, when she was denied a reasonable accommodation. However, Complainant's initial EEO contact occurred on January 20, 2012, beyond the 45-day Limitation period. Therefore, the Agency dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant alleged a denial of reasonable accommodation when she was not provided with work within her limitations. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2,--Threshold Issues," EEOC Notice 915.003, at 2-73 (July 21, 2005), provides that "because an employer has an ongoing obligation, to provide a reasonable accommodation, failure to provide such an accommodation constitutes a violation each time the employee needs it." <span class="Italic">See e.g., Peacock v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120082372 (July 31, 2008). The record indicated that Complainant still required the reasonable accommodation through May 2012. Therefore, at the time she made contact, she continued to need her requested reasonable accommodation. As such, we find that her contact on January 10, 2012, was timely. Therefore, the Agency's dismissal of the complaint was not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120130981 (2015)("Therefore, viewed as a recurring violation, we find that the Agency should have accepted for investigation all the inter-connected allegations (a-h) related to Complainant's single claim of an ongoing failure to reasonably accommodate her disabilities.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In many, if not most, cases involving claims of failure to provide reasonable accommodation, the complainant requires accommodation on daily basis. For example, an employee who has a medical restriction limiting the amount of time he or she can stand during an eight-hour shift and has a job that requires standing for prolonged periods of time will require accommodation each and every day he or she works. However, in some cases, the need for accommodation is intermittent. The most obvious example arises in cases involving deaf employees who require the services of an interpreter only for specific work-related activities. In fact, depending upon the job the employee holds, he or she may need no accommodation on most workdays. The Commission also has treated these cases as recurring violation cases, but in order for a complaint to be timely there must be some denial of accommodation in the 45 days immediately preceding counselor contact. In <span class="Italic">Estrada v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A34076 (2004), the Commission reversed the agency's decision dismissing the complaint for untimely counselor contact and remanded the case for further development of the record noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the EEO Counselor's report reflects that complainant did not initiate EEO Counselor contact until February 25, 2002. However, we note that the record contains a copy of a proposed draft settlement agreement, dated December 13, 2001, which contains a provision that "voids the request for EEO." We also note that the provisions of the proposed draft agreement address complainant's concerns regarding provision of an interpreter. Based on this evidence, we find that complainant's initial EEO contact regarding the instant complaint occurred some time prior to December 13, 2001, and that the agency erred by failing to identify and use this earlier date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, based on a fair reading of the record, including complainant's statements on PS Form 2564-A (Information for Pre-Complaint Counseling, dated February 25, 2002), we find that complainant claims that during his pre-employment processing in December 2000, he requested the services of an interpreter, both for the pre-employment processing itself, as well as during the course of his employment with the agency. Complainant claims that these services were promised by the agency, but rarely provided, despite his many subsequent requests for these services throughout his employment, up until his termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has found that the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation (the services of a sign language interpreter) may constitute a recurring violation, that is, a violation that recurs anew each day that the agency fails to provide it. <span class="Italic">See Hartnon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980365 (November 4, 1999). In this case, we find that the violation would recur each time that complainant required the assistance of a sign language interpreter, but it was not provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that complainant claims that throughout his <span id="Page_99"></span>employment, commencing with his pre-employment processing, up to the time of his termination, he was denied sign language interpreter services as a reasonable accommodation. However, because the record fails to reflect the actual date of initial EEO Counselor contact, which we find must have occurred prior to a mediation attempt and drafting of a proposed settlement agreement on December 13, 2001, we cannot fairly ascertain the temporal scope of this claim. In this regard, we find that the record also lacks information to identify any incidents occurring within the 45-day time limit. For example, while complainant makes reference to being denied an interpreter for a safety talk about anthrax, he fails to provide a date. It does not appear that the EEO Counselor, or the agency, made any attempt to clarify complainant's claim as to which specific incidents fell within the applicable time period, as evidenced by the rather inexact framing of the claims as set forth in the EEO Counselor's report and formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we find that the agency's decision dismissing the complaint must be VACATED and the case REMANDED to the agency to conduct a supplemental investigation to obtain further information.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Noda v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0120070309 (2009), the Commission found that express denial of a request for accommodation was a "discrete event" that triggered the time period for counselor contact. In that case, the complainant, who was represented by counsel, submitted a request for the accommodation of fulltime telework in April 2004. The request was denied and then reviewed by a reasonable accommodation committee that also denied the request in July. A second request for accommodation in the form of a transfer to Miami was submitted in August 2004 and denied in November. Both times, the denial notified the complainant that she had 45 days to initiate counseling if dissatisfied with the decision. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Noda</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record discloses that the alleged discriminatory events occurred on August 9, 2004, and November 8, 2004. Complainant did not contact an EEO Counselor until January 21, 2005, which was beyond the 45-day limitation period. The Commission has held that a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation may constitute a recurring violation, that is, a violation that recurs anew each day that the agency fails to provide the accommodation. <span class="Italic">Harmon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980365 (November 4, 1999). In the present case, however, complainant's requests for a reasonable accommodation were expressly denied. <span class="Italic">See Bratton v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A01488 (February 7, 2002). The agency's denials were discrete events that should have triggered complainant's suspicion of discrimination and hence her duty to contact an EEO Counselor. Although the record reveals that complainant was hospitalized in June 2004, we note that she was discharged from the hospital on June 23, 2004. We find complainant does not argue that she delayed in contacting an EEO Counselor due to incapacitation and we find that she failed to present evidence of incapacitation after her release from the hospital. We find complainant failed to present evidence warranting an extension of the applicable limitation period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency grants an accommodation but then does not follow through in a timely fashion, the delay may constitute an "ongoing violation." For example, in <span class="Italic">Talavera v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120093513 (2010), the agency dismissed a failure to accommodate complaint for untimely counselor contact where in August 2008 it responded to the complainant's accommodation request indicating that "appropriate accommodations" would be implemented. In November 2008, the agency partially implemented some accommodations. In February 2009, the complainant contacted an EEO counselor alleging that the accommodations had not been completed. In reversing the agency's dismissal of the complaint, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Talavera</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As regards the claim of denial of reasonable accommodation, the agency found that on August 29, 2008, the agency responded to his request for a reasonable accommodation by agreeing to undertake "appropriate accommodations [that] would be afforded to you that would allow you to improve your focus, concentration and organization." The agency further notes that "on November 3 2008, a partial installation of your workstation was completed, and a sample chair with lumbar support was provided until the arrival of your permanent replacement chair." The agency concluded that because the agency responded to his request for a reasonable accommodation in August, 2008, his February 2009 Counselor contact is untimely. The Commission, however, disagrees. Complainant is essentially alleging that the agency's response to his accommodation request has been insufficient, and so delayed that it amounts to a denial of the request. In his Formal Complaint, complainant states "reasonable accommodation continues to be minimized." Complainant is therefore alleging an ongoing violation, and we note that the record shows that by November 2008, the accommodation had not yet been completed. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that, notwithstanding the August 2008 agency response, complainant subsequently came to the conclusion that the agency's response in practice was so insufficient as to amount to a denial of the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether or not an accommodation is so delayed or defective as to constitute a denial of the request is a merits determination that depends on the facts of the case. However because complainant is alleging an ongoing violation, we find that his February 2009 Counselor contact was not untimely with regards to the claim alleging denial of reasonable accommodation, We therefore AFFIRM the FAD in part and REVERSE the FAD in part and REMAND the claim of denial of reasonable accommodation to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Claims of failure to accommodate during pregnancy do not create a pattern or practice. Such a claim may be dismissed if it is not brought during the pregnancy. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Gualve v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974747 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, we find that the agency properly dismissed appellant's complaint, pursuant to EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(b), for failure to initiate contact with an EEO Counselor in a timely manner. Appellant alleged that she was discriminated against by the agency when, upon appellant's reinstatement to the agency on September 30, 1996, management did not offer her any type of reasonable accommodation, such as light duty, during her pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, appellant alleged that she was not offered reasonable accommodation for her pregnancy upon her reinstatement with the agency on September 30, 1996. The Commission finds that at that time appellant had, or reasonably should have had, a reasonable suspicion that she had been discriminated against by the agency. Consequently, appellant's January 8, 1997 initial contact is untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, it is not clear why the Commission analyzed the <span class="Italic">Gualve</span> case as a reasonable accommodation case, since pregnancy is not a disability. See Chapter 13, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-22-031.html#sec13-31">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the alleged failure to accommodate involves a discrete personnel action, the Commission has held that the recurring violation theory does not apply. In <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01994157 (2001), the complainant contended that she did not initiate counseling on her accommodation claim because she was not aware that her impairment entitled her to accommodation until she attended a disability awareness program in October 1998. However, this contention was undermined by the fact that she requested accommodation as early as March 1998 and, in June 1998, accepted a position that was a demotion as an accommodation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Watkins</span> held that the complainant's counselor contact was untimely because the demotion was effective for four months prior to her counselor contact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant contends that she did not suspect discrimination until after attending a Disability Awareness luncheon in October 1998. After a careful review of the record, we find that complainant reasonably should have suspected discrimination long before this point. We note, first, that complainant alleged discrimination on the basis of race, as well as disability. There is obviously no argument that complainant was not aware of her race prior to October 1998. Moreover, the record establishes that complainant began to request an accommodation for her disability as early as March 1998. This refutes her claim that she was not aware that her impairment entitled her to file a discrimination complaint until October 1998. After a careful review of the record, we find that complainant should have suspected discrimination more than 45 days before her October 22, 1998 EEO Counselor contact. Claims (1), (2) and (4) were therefore properly dismissed for untimely Counselor contact and this portion of the FAD is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to claim (3), we find that this is not merely a claim of disparate treatment, but is also a claim that complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation when she was downgraded from a GS-5 position to a GS-3 position. To the extent that claim (3) is a disparate treatment claim, the agency's dismissal was proper on the same grounds as discussed above in regard to claims (1), (2) and (4). To the extent that complainant intended to argue that she was denied a reasonable accommodation, we note that Commission precedent holds that a reasonable accommodation claim may constitute a recurring violation, that is, a violation that recurs anew each day that an employer fails to provide an accommodation<span class="Italic">. See Harman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980365 (November 4, 1999); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01934120 (March 4, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record establishes that complainant, through her doctor, requested an accommodation as early as March 1998. On June 9, 1998, after complainant's doctor rejected the agency's initial attempts to accommodate complainant, the agency offered complainant a GS-3 position that met with the approval of her doctor. Complainant accepted this position on June 17, 1998. While complainant alleges that she did so only to avoid losing her job altogether, the record is clear that complainant did not contact an EEO Counselor until more than four months after accepting the agency's accommodation offer, despite her belief at the <span id="Page_100"></span>time of the downgrade that the agency should have accommodated her in a higher-grade position. This situation is very different from that in which a complainant requests a reasonable accommodation and the agency fails to respond to the request or fails to provide an accommodation<span class="Italic">. See Mitchell,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> (reasonable accommodation claim timely under recurring violation theory where complainant requested an accommodation and the agency failed to respond and continually failed to provide an accommodation). Accordingly, claim (3) is not a recurring violation and the agency's dismissal for failure to contact an EEO Counselor in a timely manner was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Watkins</span> case was decided prior the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, discussed above under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-11-055.html#sec2-55">The Commission's View Before <span class="Italic">Morgan-Anisman</span></a>." However, it does not appear the <span class="Italic">Anisman</span> analysis would have changed the outcome in <span class="Italic">Watkins</span>. The problem with <span class="Italic">Watkins</span> is that, under its rationale, if an agency reassigned an employee to a position as a reasonable accommodation which in fact did not constitute a reasonable accommodation, the employee loses his or her right to challenge that assignment after 45 days, regardless of the fact that the position still does not constitute a reasonable accommodation at the time the counselor is contacted. <span class="Italic">Watkins</span> attempts to draw a distinction between those situations where the agency responds to a request and those where it does not. What <span class="Italic">Watkins</span> fails to account for are those situations where the agency's response falls short of what is required by law. Why a complainant should have only 45 days from an inadequate response to initiate counseling, but a seemingly infinite amount of time from a negative response, the Commission does not explain. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11641 (2001) (holding that counselor contact in September 2000 over an agency's failure to provide a limited duty position dating back to July 1997 was timely because the complainant "was still allegedly being denied reasonable accommodation at the time of the EEO Counselor contact"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Palm v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996191 (2001) (each day after the complainant was denied a light duty position constituted a new violation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cherosky v. Henderson</span>, 330 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2003), the court found that the plaintiffs were untimely in their claim over the agency's denial of the accommodation requests to wear respirators. The Postal Service denied the requests based on an agency policy that only allowed the use of respirators where contaminants exceeded OSHA standards. The complainants did not initiate EEO counseling until more than 45 days after the denial of their requests. Relying on <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">Cherosky</span> found the individual denials were not part of a pattern or practice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The four plaintiffs in this action, Larry Cherosky, Thomas Jennings, Anthony Clemons, and Vincent Faini (the "Employees"), are or were employees of the United States Postal Service at the Gateway facility in Eugene, Oregon. The Employees claim that they began having respiratory problems after the introduction of high speed mail sorting machines into the workplace. In October 1994, each of the Employees requested permission to use a negative flow or full face respirator at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Postal Service denied the Employees' requests pursuant to its policy of prohibiting respirators except where air contaminants exceed the limits set forth in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 651-678 ("OSHA"), and its regulations. Although the parties dispute whether the policy is a flexible one which can take into account an employee's particular medical needs, the policy, in the Postal Service's own words, is as follows: "Basically we have determined that [the] policy concerning the use of respirators by Postal employees is defined by the type of atmosphere [to which] employees may be exposed while performing their duties.... Employees may not wear respirators when the working conditions do not reflect either a violation of a standard or a recommended threshold limit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to bring a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a federal employee must exhaust available administrative remedies. Federal regulations require that "[a]ggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of...handicap must consult [an EEOC] Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally resolve the matter." 29 C.F.R. 1614.105(a). This consultation must occur "within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1614.105(a)(1). Failure to comply with this regulation is "fatal to a federal employee's discrimination claim." <span class="Italic">Lyons v. England</span>, 307 F.3d 1092, 1105 (9th Cir. 2002). Thus, the primary issue in this appeal is whether the claims were properly exhausted through a timely consultation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Employees did not initiate contact with an EEOC officer within 45 days of the denial of their requests to wear respirators. Nor can the Employees point to any discrete, discriminatory act that occurred within the 45-day period. The Employees candidly acknowledge that their claims are based on conduct that occurred outside of the 45-day period prescribed in 1614.105(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the Employees argue that their claims are timely under the continuing violations doctrine. They reason that the timeliness of their claims cannot be determined based on the denial date of the accommodation demand because the Postal Service denied their requests pursuant to an ongoing discriminatory policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In evaluating the Employees' argument, we are guided by <span class="Italic">Morgan.</span> Before <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> the "lower courts [had] offered reasonable, albeit divergent solutions" to the question of whether conduct "fall[ing] outside the statutory time period for filing charges" was actionable<span class="Italic">. Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 119, 122 S. Ct. 2061. Prior to <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, a plaintiff arguably could invoke the continuing violations doctrine by demonstrating "either [a] series of related acts, one or more of which falls within the limitations period, or the maintenance of a discriminatory system both before and during the statutory period." HENRY H. PERRITT, JR., CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACE, 7.04[E] (3d ed. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, however, the Supreme Court substantially limited the notion of continuing violations: "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 122, 122 S. Ct. 2061. In specifically rejecting the application of the continuing violations doctrine to what the Employees now characterize as a "serial violation," the Court explained that "[e]ach discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In contrast to discrete acts, the Court carved out an exception for claims based on a hostile work environment. Noting that by their very nature hostile environment claims involve repeated conduct, the Court held that claims based on a hostile environment "will not be time barred so long as all acts which constitute the claim are part of the same unlawful employment practice and at least one act falls within the time period."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 127, 122 S. Ct. 2061.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Morgan</span> makes clear that claims based on discrete acts are only timely where such acts occurred within the limitations period, and that claims based on a hostile environment are only timely where at least one act occurred during the limitations period. Acknowledging that their claims would be untimely under either of these tests because no discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period, the Employees attempt to cast their allegations as a pattern-or-practice claim, noting that the Supreme Court expressly reserved the question of timely filing as applied to such claims<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 123 n.9, 122 S. Ct. 2061 ("We have no occasion here to consider the timely filing question with respect to 'pattern-or-practice claims'....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we doubt whether the Postal Service's conduct is properly analyzed under the "pattern-or-practice" rubric. Although the terms "pattern-or-practice" are not defined by statute, we have held that these terms have their ordinary meaning<span class="Italic">. See United States v. Ironworkers Local 86</span>, 443 F.2d 544, 552 (9th Cir. 1971) ("The words were not intended to be words of art," internal citations omitted). As the Supreme Court explained, pattern-or-practice claims cannot be based on "sporadic discriminatory acts" but rather must be based on discriminatory conduct that is widespread throughout a company or that is a routine and regular part of the workplace<span class="Italic">. See Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Employees have not attempted to show, by argument let alone with statistical or any other evidence, that the Postal Service widely discriminates against employees with disabilities or even that it routinely discriminates with respect to respirator requests<span class="Italic">. See Lyons</span>, 307 F.3d at 1107 n.8 (explaining that plaintiffs bringing pattern-or-practice claims typically use statistical evidence to demonstrate the employer's past treatment of the protected group). Nor do the Employees assert that it is discriminatory for the Postal Service to prohibit the use of respirators as a general rule. Rather, they each challenge the Postal Service's individualized decision to deny their accommodation requests by asserting that they should be granted an exception from the no-respirator rule because of their particular respiratory needs. As the district court aptly noted, the "heart of plaintiffs' complaint does not stem from the policy regarding the use of respirators, but rather from the individualized decisions that resulted from implementation of a policy originating from OSHA." These individualized decisions are best characterized as discrete acts, rather than as a pattern or practice of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The allegation that these discrete acts were undertaken pursuant to a discriminatory policy does not extend the statutory limitations period set forth in 29 C.F.R. 1614.105(a)(1). Rather, as we concluded in <span class="Italic">Lyons</span>, "[plaintiff's] assertion that this series of discrete acts flows from a company-wide, or systematic, discriminatory practice will not succeed in establishing the employer's liability for acts occurring outside the limitations period because the Supreme Court has determined that each incident of discrimination constitutes a separate actionable unlawful employment practice." <span class="Italic">Lyons</span>, 307 F.3d at 1107. Thus, "[a] discriminatory practice, though it may extend over time and involve a series of related acts, remains divisible into a set of discrete acts, legal action on the basis of each of which must be brought within the statutory limitations period."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1108.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion that a discriminatory policy claim does not extend the <span id="Page_101"></span>statute of limitations finds support in <span class="Italic">Bazemore v. Friday</span>, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S. Ct. 3000, 92 L. Ed.2d 315 (1986), in which the Supreme Court considered a pattern-or-practice challenge to a discriminatory salary structure. The Court noted that the plaintiffs' salary discrimination claim did not accrue based on the existence of the policy or based on when the policy took effect. Instead, "[e]ach week's paycheck that deliver[ed] less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 395, 106 S. Ct. 3000. Just as the wrong in <span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> accrued each time the salary policy was implemented, the alleged wrong here occurred and accrued when the policy was invoked to deny an individual employee's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also draw support from a persuasive opinion from the Second Circuit, the only other circuit to have considered the question of whether an employer's rejection of a proposed accommodation can be a continuing violation<span class="Italic">. See Elmenayer v. ABF Freight Sys.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Inc.</span>, 318 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2003). The case involved a Muslim truck driver who sought an adjustment to his work schedule for religious reasons. His employer denied his request for time off during the work day, suggesting instead that Elmenayer bid on evening work assignments so that he would be free to attend religious services during the day<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 132. Elmenayer sued, alleging that his employer unreasonably refused to accommodate his religious practices as required by Title VII<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 133.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was undisputed that Elmenayer failed to file a charge with the EEOC within the statutory period. Elmenayer asserted, as the Employees do here, that his claims should be considered timely nonetheless because his requests were denied pursuant to a discriminatory policy and that the timeliness should "be measured from the latest date when [he] was still prevented from observing his religious requirements in the way he had proposed."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 134. Relying on <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> and <span class="Italic">Bazemore</span>, the Second Circuit rejected this argument:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">These rulings persuade us that an employer's rejection of an employee's proposed accommodation...does not give rise to a continuing violation. Rather, the rejection is the sort of "discrete act" that must be the subject of a complaint to the EEOC within [the statutory period.]...Although the effect of the employer's rejection continues to be felt by the employee for as long as he remains employed, that continued effect is similar to the continued effect of being denied a promotion or denied a transfer, denials that <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> offered as examples of a discrete act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 134-35. Explaining that the "clear message of <span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> is that an employer performs a separate employment practice each time it takes adverse action against an employee," the Second Circuit held that an employee must challenge an adverse action within the limitations period, "even if that action is simply a periodic implementation of an adverse decision previously made."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 134. The same reasoning applies here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that it would eviscerate <span class="Italic">Morgan's</span> premise to circumvent the timely filing requirements merely because a plaintiff alleges that the acts were taken pursuant to a discriminatory policy. As the Fifth Circuit observed, "[i]f the mere existence of a policy is sufficient to constitute a continuing violation, it is difficult to conceive of a circumstance in which a plaintiff's claim of an unlawful employment policy could be untimely." <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Baylor Coll. of Med.</span>, 805 F.2d 528, 533 (5th Cir. 1986). The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that the application of the continuing violations doctrine should be the exception, rather than the rule. We are not free to depart from this directive....</p>
