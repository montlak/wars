<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-40"><span id="Page_1312"></span><span class="space">D.</span> IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE ACCOMMODATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC prescribes an interactive, "problem-solving" approach to identifying possible reasonable accommodations. This process recognizes that, in most cases, the employee has a greater knowledge of his or her disability and the limitations it imposes, but the agency has the greater knowledge of its positions and operations and how those may be modified to accommodate the employee's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The approach is described in 29 CFR 1630, app. at 1630.9:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a qualified individual with a disability has requested a reasonable accommodation to assist in the performance of a job, the employer, using a problem solving approach, should:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Analyze the particular job involved and determine its purpose and essential functions;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Consult with the individual with a disability to ascertain the precise job-related limitations imposed by the individual's disability and how those limitations could be overcome with a reasonable accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;In consultation with the individual to be accommodated, identify potential accommodations and assess the effectiveness each would have in enabling the individual to perform the essential functions of the position; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Consider the preference of the individual to be accommodated and select and implement the accommodation that is most appropriate for both the employee and the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In many instances, the appropriate reasonable accommodation may be so obvious to either or both the employer and the qualified individual with a disability that it may not be necessary to proceed in this step-by-step fashion. For example, if an employee who uses a wheelchair requests that his or her desk be placed on blocks to elevate the desktop above the arms of the wheelchair and the employer complies, an appropriate accommodation has been requested, identified, and provided without either the employee or employer being aware of having engaged in any sort of "reasonable accommodation process."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in some instances neither the individual requesting the accommodation nor the employer can readily identify the appropriate accommodation. For example, the individual needing the accommodation may not know enough about the equipment used by the employer or the exact nature of the work site to suggest an appropriate accommodation. Likewise, the employer may not know enough about the individual's disability or the limitations that disability would impose on the performance of the job to suggest an appropriate accommodation. Under such circumstances, it may be necessary for the employer to initiate a more defined problem solving process, such as the step-by-step process described above, as part of its reasonable effort to identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This process requires the individual assessment of both the particular job at issue, and the specific physical or mental limitations of the particular individual in need of reasonable accommodation. With regard to assessment of the job, "individual assessment" means analyzing the actual job duties and determining the true purpose or object of the job. Such an assessment is necessary to ascertain which job functions are the essential functions that an accommodation must enable an individual with a disability to perform.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After assessing the relevant job, the employer, in consultation with the individual requesting the accommodation, should make an assessment of the specific limitations imposed by the disability on the individual's performance of the job's essential functions. This assessment will make it possible to ascertain the precise barrier to the employment opportunity which, in turn, will make it possible to determine the accommodation(s) that could alleviate or remove that barrier.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If consultation with the individual in need of the accommodation still does not reveal potential appropriate accommodations, then the employer, as part of this process, may find that technical assistance is helpful in determining how to accommodate the particular individual in the specific situation. Such assistance could be sought from the Commission, from State or local rehabilitation agencies, or from disability constituent organizations. It should be noted, however, that, as provided in Sec. 1630.9(c) of this part, the failure to obtain or receive technical assistance from the Federal agencies that administer the ADA will not excuse the employer from its reasonable accommodation obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once potential accommodations have been identified, the employer should assess the effectiveness of each potential accommodation in assisting the individual in need of the accommodation in the performance of the essential functions of the position. If more than one of these accommodations will enable the individual to perform the essential functions or if the individual would prefer to provide his or her own accommodation, the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration. However, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide. It should also be noted that the individual's willingness to provide his or her own accommodation does not relieve the employer of the duty to provide the accommodation should the individual for any reason be unable or unwilling to continue to provide the accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In identifying possible accommodations, the burden is on the agency to inquire about the qualifications and limitations of the complainant and, if the complainant cannot be accommodated in his or her present position, conduct a search for possible vacant positions the complainant could perform. The complainant should assist the agency by identifying any possible vacancies of which he or she is aware. In <span class="Italic">Corbett v. General Services Administration</span>, 03A10017 (2001), the Commission explained the agency's obligation by focusing on the superior position of the agency in identifying vacancies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether petitioner was a "qualified" individual with a disability, the ID concluded that petitioner was not "qualified" because she could not perform the essential functions of her then-current position as a clerk-typist, and failed "to articulate a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could have performed the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned." This is contrary to the Commission's interpretation of the agency's obligation under the Rehabilitation Act. The Commission has previously noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The employer is in the best position to know which jobs are vacant or will become vacant within a reasonable period of time. In order to narrow the search for potential vacancies, the employer, as part of the interactive process, should ask the employee about his/her qualifications and interests. Based on this information, the employer is obligated to inform an employee about vacant positions for which s/he may be eligible as a reassignment. However, an employee should assist the employer in identifying appropriate vacancies to the extent that the employee has access to information about them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002 (March 1, 1999) (Enforcement Guidance) at question 28.2 Thus, while an agency is not obligated to create a new position for an individual with a disability, it must make a good faith effort to locate a vacant, funded position for which he or she is qualified. "Only after determining that reassignment to a vacant position was not possible or would result in an undue hardship, would the Rehabilitation Act permit the agency to conclude that [a petitioner] is not a qualified individual with a disability." <span class="Italic">Kitaura v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03980089 (March 11, 1999)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> EEOC Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation (October 20, 2000) at questions 21-23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant record does not address whether or not a vacant position existed to which complainant could have been reassigned at the relevant time, and if so, whether she could have been accommodated in such a position absent undue hardship. Moreover, even if reassignment was unavailable, the record does not address whether or not petitioner's request for continued LWOP as an accommodation constituted an undue hardship. Unpaid leave is a form of reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. See</span> Enforcement Guidance at questions 16-21. In a case involving excessive absence from work, an individual with a disability may prove that he or she is "qualified"--in spite of such absence--by first showing that there is a sufficient nexus between the absences and the purported disability, and the burden then becomes the agency's to demonstrate that it would pose an undue hardship for the agency to tolerate or excuse an employee's absence<span class="Italic">. See Roscoe v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974138 (September 21, 2000); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950539 (April 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Southerland v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930714 (July 15, 1994); <span class="Italic">Omar v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920207 (May 14, 1992); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05880859 (May 21, 1990). Accordingly, a remand is necessary in order to determine whether, at the time petitioner sought accommodation, it would have posed an undue hardship to (1) allow petitioner to work a part-time schedule either in her clerk-typist position or in another position to which she could be reassigned, or (2) allow complainant to continue on LWOP. On remand the Board should require the agency to provide evidence on these issues in order to complete the record for review.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible for an agency to meet the requirements of the interactive accommodation process even though it has not designated the process as such. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wu v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991844 (2002), the Commission found the agency met process requirements during its considerations in finding the complainant a job within her OWCP medical restrictions. In finding that the agency discharged its obligations in <span class="Italic">Wu</span>, the Commission focused not on the designation of the process, but on its interactive quality:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It looks to us like the agency focused almost exclusively on ensuring that the Gate Monitor--Message Taker job met complainant's medical <span id="Page_1313"></span>restrictions for worker's compensation purposes. That is, while the agency obviously tried to meet its duties under the relevant worker's compensation regulations, we are not positive it ever consciously considered its obligation to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. The two certainly are not synonymous<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Workers' Compensation and the ADA</span> (Sept. 3, 1996) (web version), at 15 ("An employer cannot substitute vocational rehabilitation services in place of a reasonable accommodation required by the [Rehabilitation Act] for an employee with a disability-related occupational injury. An employee's rights under the [Rehabilitation Act] are separate from his/her entitlements under a workers' compensation law.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the agency did engage complainant--through an exchange of letters and medical reports--in a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> informal, interactive process in an attempt to ascertain the nature of complainant's condition and the work limitations it caused<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(o)(3) ("To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the [employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the [complainant]. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Mar. 1, 1999) (web version), at 5 ("A request for a reasonable accommodation is the first step in an informal, interactive process between the individual and the employer.");<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 6 ("The employer and the individual with a disability should engage in an informal process to clarify what the individual needs and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation."); 29 CFR 1630.2(o) (app.) ("The determination of which accommodation is appropriate in a particular situation involves a process in which the employer and employee identify the precise limitations imposed by the disability and explore potential accommodations that would overcome those limitations."); and 29 CFR 1630.9 (app.) ("[T]he employer must make a reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, after the agency offered complainant what it believed to be an appropriate reassignment, it gave her an explicit opportunity to explain whether and why she could not accept it<span class="Italic">. See</span> Letter from OWCP to Complainant (Apr. 21, 1998) ("You were offered a position as a Modified Clerk...which we find to be suitable to your work capabilities.... You have 30 days from the date of this letter to accept the position or provide an explanation of the reasons for refusing it. Without further notice, at the expiration of 30 days, a final decision on this issue will be made. If you fail to accept the position, any explanation or evidence which you provide will be considered prior to determining whether or not your reasons for refusing the job are justified...."). Complainant did respond, telling the agency that the job offered was unsuitable, given her doctor's alleged orders<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, Annotated Job Assignment and Physical Requirements Form. The agency rejected complainant's view, of course, and determined that the Gate Monitor--Message Taker position was in fact consistent with complainant's medical restrictions and would suffice to accommodate them<span class="Italic">. See</span> OWCP Memorandum (Apr. 21, 1998); Letter from OWCP to Complainant (Apr. 21, 1998); and Second Letter from OWCP to Complainant (May 22, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency. While complainant may have believed that the position offered was untenable, her protestations are not paramount. To be sure, the suggestions and preferences of an employee seeking reasonable accommodation are highly relevant and must be considered<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Mar. 1, 1999) (web version), at 6 ("[S]uggestions from the individual with a disability may assist the employer in determining the type of reasonable accommodation to provide."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 29 CFR 1630.9 (app.) ("[T]he preference [in reasonable accommodation] of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration.") However, an employer is not required to provide the precise reasonable accommodation an employee wants, so long as the employer provides a reasonable accommodation that is effective<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Mar. 1, 1999) (web version), at 8 ("The employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective"); <span class="Italic">cf. id.</span> at 4 ("While an individual with a disability may request a change due to a medical condition, this request does not necessarily mean that the employer is required to provide the change.") It is the agency providing the accommodation which "has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations...." 29 CFR 1630.9 (app.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As this Commission has noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The reasonable accommodation requirement is best understood as a means by which barriers to the equal employment opportunity of an individual with a disability are removed or alleviated.... Equal employment opportunity means an opportunity to attain the same level of performance, or to enjoy the same level of benefits and privileges of employment as are available to the average similarly situated employee without a disability.... The accommodation, however, does not have to be the "best" accommodation possible, so long as it is sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 CFR 1630.9 (app.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We credit the agency's attempts to find a position that was consistent with complainant's "job-related needs" (even if this search was conducted in the workers' compensation context). It seems the agency made a significant, conscious effort to reassign complainant in a role that would "meet the criteria of all [her] medical limitations," and be "in strict compliance with [her] medical restrictions." <span class="Italic">See</span> Agency's Letter to Complainant Offering Rehabilitation Program Job (Mar. 30, 1998); <span class="Italic">see</span> also OWCP Memorandum (Apr. 21, 1998). Moreover, based on the record before us, we believe the agency was successful in this search. That is, we believe, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the duties of the Gate Monitor--Message Taker were consistent with complainant's abilities and alleged disabilities. While we might wish complainant had been happier with the particular position the agency picked, we cannot hold the agency liable simply because the reasonable accommodation it selected (however effective) was also unpopular. Therefore, we cannot find that any disability discrimination occurred here.</p>
