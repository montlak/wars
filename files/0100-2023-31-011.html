<h3 class="h3" id="sec22-12"><span class="space">C.</span> PREVAILING THROUGH SETTLEMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">Attorney fees are often a sticky point in settlement negotiations involving any aspect of federal personnel law. Agencies generally take the position that the employee should be responsible for his or her own attorney fees and that awarding attorney fees in settlement agreements merely encourages employees to retain lawyers whenever they have a dispute with their supervisors. Because agencies feel they already are giving substantial relief through the settlement, they equate paying for the employee's lawyer with paying for the privilege of settling the dispute. Employees, on the other hand, usually feel they would not have needed a lawyer if the agency had not treated them unfairly in the first place. Because they see the agency as the cause of their problem, they see no reason why the agency should not pay their counsel fees. To complicate matters, most lawyers operate under disciplinary rules that require they not make settlement of cases contingent upon payment of their fee. They must balance this rule with their legitimate interest in being paid for their services.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's first question when fees are raised in the context of settlement agreements is how much the fees will be. Agency representatives, who are paid on a salary basis, often believe that the hourly rate of the private bar is too high. Certainly, most people do not make $100, $200, $300 or more per hour. The fact is that neither do the lawyers who charge those rates. Many factors go into the hourly rate of a particular lawyer. Out of that rate, bills and staff must be paid. Negotiations over attorney fees often can impact on other areas of settlement. After finding out the extent of fees, agencies sometimes wish to renegotiate items that previously had been agreed upon by the parties. In the worst case scenario, fee negotiations can lead to a breakdown of settlement discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The former regulations of the EEOC at Part 1613 regarding the award of fees as part of settlement provided a means for resolving the award while leaving the rest of the agreement intact. Title 29 CFR 1613.217(a) provided that where the parties agreed on all other items with respect to settlement but could not resolve the issue of fees, the question of the fee award could be severed from the complaint. The parties then could enter settlement on all other issues, while allowing the fee award to proceed to a final agency decision. In effect, the EEOC ultimately acted as a fee arbiter between the parties. Once the agency made a final decision with respect to the fee award, that decision could be appealed to the Commission like any other final agency decision on a discrimination complaint. The provision for severing the issue of attorney fees in settlement negotiations was eliminated from Part 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although severance of fees is no longer specifically provided for in the Commission's regulations, nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to sever the issue of attorney fees. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Borner v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01945753 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the record that appellant and the agency made no attempt to resolve the issue of attorney's fees in the settlement agreement. However, resolution of the attorney's fees issue in the settlement agreement is not required by the Commission's regulations. Additionally, there is no requirement that the parties sever the issue of attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">Yelena Pinzavetsky v. U.S. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943059 (May 15, 1995). In this instance, a memorandum from the AJ dated July 19, 1994, indicates that the parties wished to sever the issue of attorney's fees. The agency's contention that appellant is not entitled to attorney's fees because there were no provisions for attorney's fees in the settlement agreement is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that appellant waived the right to claim attorney's fees in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement is not an automatic waiver of attorney's fees request. There is no express waiver of attorney's fees in this case. The agency's omission of any discussion related to attorney's fees in the settlement agreement whether intentional or inadvertent does not constitute an express waiver of appellant's request for attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01910620 (August 15, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1983"></span>Whether the complainant is ultimately entitled to fees then becomes a question of whether the complainant can be considered the prevailing party in the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110 at 11-12 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;A complainant who prevails through a negotiated settlement is entitled to attorney's fees and costs under the same standards as any other prevailing party<span class="Italic">.

In class cases, the Administrative Judge should review the agreement to ensure that the negotiated fee is fair and reasonable to all parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Where the parties enter into a settlement agreement that provides for but does not quantify the amount of attorney's fees and costs, the attorney should submit his/her statement of fees and costs and supporting documentation to the agency for determination of the amount due. The agency should issue a decision on fees within 60 days of receipt of the statement and supporting documentation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(A). If the complainant disputes the amount awarded, s/he may file an appeal with the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's notation of court cases holding that the failure to address fees in a settlement is a waiver of fees is interesting because it runs contrary to its own case law as discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to be a prevailing party, the settlement must provide at least some of the relief requested. The mere fact of settlement does not mean the complainant is the prevailing party. For example, in <span class="Italic">Malone v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960397 (1998), the Commission determined that the complainant was not a prevailing party. Pointing out that the complaint involved a suspension and work hours, and the settlement agreement did not address these matters:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency employed appellant as a Supervisor Distribution Operator, EAS-16, when she filed two complaints on April 29, 1994, alleging that: (1) she was discriminated against on the bases of gender and reprisal when she was given a seven day suspension; and (2) she was discriminated against on the bases of gender, age (DOB, 7/2/41) and disability (speech impediment) when she was denied overtime and informed that she was limited to a forty hour work-week. The agency conducted an investigation, after which appellant requested a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At a pre-hearing conference, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, executed on July 20, 1995, providing, in part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;No reprisal action will be taken against Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;The agency will issue complainant a letter of removal for inability to perform her duties not later than July 25, 1995, effective the date her present sick leave expires, and assist complainant in applying for Discontinued Service Retirement with appropriate forms.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;The issue of attorney's fees is severed. Complainant's attorney...can apply to the agency for reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to the agreement, appellant's representative, by letter dated September 6, 1995, applied to the agency for attorney's fees. Receiving no response from the agency, appellant filed this appeal. On appeal, the agency contends that appellant should be denied attorney's fees, as she is not a prevailing party under the law. In response, appellant essentially contends that she is a prevailing party due to the "novelty and difficulty" of the questions presented and the manner in which counsel was able to convince the agency to terminate appellant for inability to perform her duties so she could receive a discontinued service annuity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that in order to be a prevailing party, appellant must have substantially received the relief sought and there must be a determination that the complaint was a catalyst motivating the agency to provide the relief<span class="Italic">. Troie v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951497 (May 27, 1997), citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. Staats</span>, 706 F.2d 336 (D.C. Cir. 1983). In her complaint, appellant alleged discrimination as a result of being given a seven day suspension, being denied overtime and being limited to a forty hour work week. None of these issues were resolved or addressed in any way in the settlement agreement; consequently, the complaint was not a catalyst nor did appellant substantially receive the relief sought as a result of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under Part 1613, where the issue of fees simply was not addressed in the settlement agreement, attorney fees were available to complainants who substantially prevailed in their claims through settlement. Settlement alone did not entitle the employee to fees. The employee was still required to demonstrate that he was the prevailing party. When a complainant entered into a settlement agreement that provided he would withdraw his complaint, the agency admitted no fault and offered no relief, the employee was not a prevailing party for the purposes of a fee award. <span class="Italic">See Proctor v. USPS</span>, 01830998 (1983). When a complainant and her representative refused to attend a settlement conference scheduled by the agency and the complaint was settled at the prehearing conference, the agency properly refused payment of the attorney's time expended between the scheduled meeting and the prehearing conference. <span class="Italic">See Pena v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830549 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, it was not clear what position the Commission would take on the failure to address attorney fees in settlement agreements under Part 1614, which does not provide for severance of the fee issue. Specifically, while the Commission did not provide for severance of the fee issue in Part 1614, it also did not prohibit severance of the issue. However, because of the Commission's position that even under Part 1613, which specifically provided for the severance of fees, the failure to address the fee issue in settlement was not a waiver of fees, it seemed likely that the Commission would take the same position under Part 1614. The question remains whether the case law of the Commission is now overruled by the 1999 revisions to MD-110.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission confirmed its position that failure to include fees in an agreement was not a waiver of fees in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01943841 (1994), where it found the complainant would be entitled to an award of attorney fees as a prevailing party when the agreement was silent on the issue of fees. However, the Commission remanded the case because it was not clear if the complainant's representative was in fact an attorney and whether a petition for fees was filed. That position has now been reversed and the Commission has held that the failure to address fees in the settlement agreement constitutes a waiver of fees. For example, in <span class="Italic">Guitierrez v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520080682 (2008), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the settlement agreement provided no provisions for the payment of attorney's fees and costs. As such, we find that complainant waived the ability to collect fees and costs with regard to the creation and adoption of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the 2015 revisions to MD-110, at 11-12, explicitly states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A settlement agreement that fails, however, to preserve the issue of fees and costs will operate as an implicit waiver of fees and costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">A finding of discrimination is not a prerequisite to the award of attorney fees when a case is resolved by informal adjustment. Because fees are not mandatory in that situation, failure to address the issue of fees in the agreement may lead to the agency's liability for such fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of Interior</span>, 01821002 (1983); (But see discussion of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> above in section on "<a href="0100-2023-31-008.html#sec22-9">Prevailing Parties</a>.") In <span class="Italic">Archuleta</span>, the Commission found that fees were warranted because the case was settled three days after the attorney first informed that agency that he had been retained. Nor is there any requirement that a complainant show facts demonstrating some degree of guilt on the part of the agency. "[T]he question of prevailing party status is a question of law, not fact." <span class="Italic">Whiting v. ACTION</span>, 05900093 (1990). The complainant "need only allege a claim that is colorable under the civil rights laws--that has some minimum basis in law...." <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01910620 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, <span class="Italic">supra)</span>. A complainant's allegations and affidavit are sufficient if they demonstrate a colorable claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Franchi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922456 (1992), the Commission set aside an agreement that did not contain a provision regarding attorney fees on the basis that there was no "meeting of the minds" between the parties. In that case, the EEOC administrative judge incorrectly advised the agency that if no provision regarding fees was in the agreement, the appellant would not be entitled to fees. The Commission noted that it was unclear whether the appellant or her representative participated in the discussion between the judge and the agency. As a result, the Commission found the parties failed to reach an agreement on a material issue related to settlement. The <span class="Italic">Franchi</span> decision should not be interpreted to mean that the Commission routinely will set aside settlement agreements that do not address the issue of fees. The critical factor in that case was the errant advice of the administrative judge which led to the agency to believe that it would have no liability for fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fees are not barred by provisions in agreements stating that the agency does not admit fault or liability. <span class="Italic">Jansen v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05880641 (1989). The focus is on the relief provided and the role of the complaint in attaining that relief. The relevant inquiry is whether "appellant succeeded in getting the agency to do more than it was already committed to do...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Parks v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05880609 (1988), the Commission found that, in a settlement agreement that did not address the fee issue, language to the effect that the agreement constituted the "complete understanding" of the parties was not an express waiver by the complainant of her right to pursue fees under 29 CFR 1613.217. The Commission held the complainant was entitled to a final agency decision on the issue of fees with attendant appeal rights to the Commission following that decision. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Stanewicz v. <span id="Page_1984"></span>Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01902331 (1990) (when an agreement does not provide for fees, there is no requirement that the agency be notified of an impending fee request; the agency was amply notified by virtue of the fact that it knew the complainant was represented by an attorney).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the Commission amended its regulations in 1992 to provide that an agency may dismiss a complaint for failure to accept full relief, it was called upon to decide a plethora of cases involving whether an agency's offer actually constituted full relief. However, two questions relating to attorney fees arose from the full relief scenario and remain relevant, to the extent that an offer of full relief can still be made at the hearing stage. The first is whether a complainant is entitled to recover for fees incurred by consulting with an attorney to determine whether an offer actually constitutes full relief. The second is whether a complainant is entitled to fees for appeal work after rejecting an offer of full relief where the Commission requires only a minor modification to the offer. The Commission answered both questions in the affirmative in <span class="Italic">Emerson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01912650 (1991). Given the complexity of relief issues, it is entirely reasonable that a complainant should consult with counsel on an agency settlement offer.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Emerson</span>, the only modification to the agency's offer was the requirement that the agency include a provision in the agreement providing that it would not in any way retaliate against the complainant in the future for exercising his rights. Though the modification to the offer was minor, the Commission nonetheless found it was short of full relief. However, the Commission denied fees for time spent on the issue of back pay because no back pay was recovered as a result of counsel's efforts.</p>
