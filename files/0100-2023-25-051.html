<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-50"><span class="space">A.</span> DISCRIMINATORY STATEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">As discussed in Chapter 10 on burdens of proof under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-19-002.html#sec10-3">Evolution of 'Disparate Treatment' Theory</a>," the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis should not be used when the complainant establishes his case through direct evidence of discriminatory intent. There are, however, cases where direct discriminatory evidence is general in nature and must be analyzed under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, along with circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cashwell v. Department of Navy</span>, 01853382 (1987), the complainant's supervisor made general comments about replacing older employees with "young blood":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This evidence presents an issue as to whether such generalized statements about the need for younger employees may be used in a finding of age discrimination. Some courts have given little credence to generalized expressions on the part of management for younger employees. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Flax</span>, 618 F.2d 1062, 1066 (4th Cir. 1980), the court did not find statements by the employer that the "Division's future lay in its young Ph.D.'s." and that all employees reached a peak, to be discriminatory; instead, the court said that such statements reflected a fact of life that younger employees eventually replace the older. In another case, <span class="Italic">Kier v. Commercial Union Insurance</span>, [808 F.2d 1254 (7th Cir. 1987)], the court stated that the jury could draw a modest inference from testimony that the employer was looking for younger attorneys in general, stating that, "[t]his inference alone, especially in the absence of any showing that others were fired or forced to leave, is insufficient to support a jury verdict against Commercial." <span class="Italic">Kier</span> at 1259. But, in <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Sandia Corporation</span>, 639 F.2d 600, 608 (9th Cir. 1981), in reaching its findings of discrimination, the court considered supervisory memoranda and personnel reports which stereotyped older employees as obsolete and unproductive, and stated that young Ph.D.'s were the company's future.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cashwell</span> found the general statements, taken in combination with statistical evidence that tended to show age discrimination, were evidence of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order for "age related remarks [to] be probative of age discrimination," the complainant must show "they are connected with the adverse action taken against a complainant." <span class="Italic">Doucette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883808 (1989). It is not sufficient under <span class="Italic">Doucette</span> to show that a management official made age-related remarks:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For there to be a nexus between comments made by a manager or supervisor and some adverse employment action taken against a complainant, such comments or statements must be shown to have come from someone directly responsible for the employment decision.... [C]omments or statements from one (1) individual in a chain of command within an organization are insufficient to give rise to an inference of age discrimination, let alone to provide sufficient proof as to the motivation or intent of those responsible for the employment decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Haskell v. Kaman Corp.</span>, 743 F.2d 113 (2d Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">McLaurin v. Fisher</span>, 768 F.2d 98 (6th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, comments by a management official that the complainant was a "dinosaur" are not direct evidence of discrimination where the official had no <span id="Page_1462"></span>role in the decision to remove the complainant. <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01941299 (1995). A selecting official's comments to the complainant that he was up "against some pretty amazing kids" was not sufficient, standing alone, to demonstrate pretext. <span class="Italic">Zaleski v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A55893 (2006). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120132641 (2014) ("Even assuming his supervisor called him a 'grumpy old man' on one or two occasions, we conclude that that alone is insufficient to find that he was subjected to a hostile work environment, or to find that supervisory decisions about his workload, assignments and/or training opportunities were made because of his age.").</p>
<p class="noindent">A single age-related derogatory comment that "translators skills deteriorate as they grow older" by the complainant's supervisor was not enough to establish age discrimination in <span class="Italic">Alyce R. v. Secretary of Justice</span>, 0120141808 (2016). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Alyce R</span>. alleged age discrimination when the agency placed her on a performance improvement period and ultimately terminated her. While noting that the supervisor's comment was "disturbing," the Commission had little trouble finding no discrimination, noting the complainant's well-documented performance deficiencies.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Kruecke v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A60028 (2006), the Commission found that a supervisor's comments that he did not believe the complainant would benefit from computer training but younger employees would benefit was indicative of discriminatory animus. The comments combined with the fact that the complainant did not experience any alleged performance problems before the new supervisor arrived and her placement on a performance improvement plan demonstrated pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">Questions about a candidate's long-term commitment to the agency and whether he or she would still be with the agency in five years were not found to indicative of age discrimination where all candidates were asked the same questions. In <span class="Italic">Range v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01A50438 (2005), the Commission noted that it had found such questions indicative of age discrimination in other cases, but there was no evidence in the <span class="Italic">Range</span> case that the complainant was asked about his age or his plans to retire.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a distinct difference between comments directed at an older individual designed to pressure him or her into retirement, see section on "<a href="0100-2023-25-056.html#sec16-55">Forced Retirement</a>," and legitimate questions an employer has about the plans of an older employee with respect to retirement. There is no inherent link between questions about retirement and age discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Woythal v. Tex-Tenn Corporation</span>, 112 F.3d 243 (6th Cir. 1997), the court rejected the plaintiff's arguments that questions about his retirement plans evidenced an intent to pressure him into retiring so he could be replaced by a younger employee. In so finding, the court in <span class="Italic">Woythal,</span> 112 F.3d at 247, attempted to explain the difference between legitimate inquiries and comments that exhibit age-based animus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To do this, [show pretext] Woythal relies on the questions that Seifert and others asked him about his plans for retirement. He insists that each time Seifert asked him what he wanted to do for the company and what his plans for the future were, he answered that he wanted to keep working for Tex-Tenn until he was about 70 years old. Woythal claims that Seifert, Carico and others continued to ask him about his retirement "to the point that he believed he was being pressured to retire...." However, as the district court noted, these questions about his plans for the future do not amount to evidence that Woythal's age was the reason for his departure from Tex-Tenn; in fact, he has not shown that anyone at Tex-Tenn made direct references to his age at all. The cases Woythal relies on to show that comments about an employee's age or impending retirement can indicate discriminatory motive all involve far more egregious statements than occurred here. <span class="Italic">See McDonald v. Union Camp Corp.</span>, 898 F.2d 1155, 1162 (6th Cir. 1990) (older employee told he could be "cheaply replaced with a younger salesman"); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Manville Sales Corp</span>., 27 F.3d 1089, 1094 (5th Cir. 1994) ("old man," "old and inflexible" and "incapable"); <span class="Italic">Corbin v. Southland Int'l Trucks</span>, 25 F.3d 1545, 1549 (11th Cir. 1994) ("at your age you cannot produce like you once could, and we are going to have to make some kind of adjustment"); <span class="Italic">Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Community College Dist</span>., 934 F.2d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 1991) ("old warhorse"); and <span class="Italic">Braverman v. Penobscot Shoe Co.</span>, 859 F. Supp. 596, 601 (D. Me. 1994) (employer provided plaintiff with unsolicited and unwelcome retirement information package and suggested that he retire). Compared to these statements, Seifert's "what are your plans for the future" is more of a friendly inquiry than a covert attempt to force retirement. It is evident that Seifert never felt he got a straight answer from Woythal, and was frustrated, as his directives to Carico reveal. It does not appear, however, that Seifert was trying to make Woythal retire.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Woythal, supra</span> at 247, next discussed what constitutes "pressure to retire":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To show that the questions about his plans were related to his age, Woythal relies on <span class="Italic">Braverman</span> and other cases which hold that a supervisor's pressure and constant questioning of an older employee about retirement is sufficient to raise an inference of discriminatory intent to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See Sischo-Nownejad</span>, 934 F.2d at 1108; <span class="Italic">Rottersman v. CBS Inc.</span>, 726 F. Supp. 484, 488, 492 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). Both <span class="Italic">Braverman</span> and <span class="Italic">Rottersman</span> indicate that pressure to retire occurs when the employer initiates the questioning and then pointedly suggests retirement. In this case, however, no one at Tex-Tenn ever explicitly mentioned retirement or suggested to Woythal that he retire. Seifert merely asked Woythal what his plans were, and did not suggest that Woythal should have answered his questions by announcing his plans to retire. In addition, as the district court noted, the testimony of Tex-Tenn employees showed that Woythal himself generated many of the rumors regarding his retirement. As Tex-Tenn's president, Seifert had a legitimate concern in making sure that Tex-Tenn had continuing engineering support, and he was entitled to inquire of Woythal whether the rumors were true. Asking questions about an employee's plans for the future, without referring to the employee's age, especially when rumors are circulating that the employee is planning to retire, does not amount to pressure to retire. This is so even though Woythal may have interpreted it as pressure, because "[m]ere personal belief, conjecture and speculation are insufficient to support an inference of age discrimination." <span class="Italic">Chappell</span>, 803 F.2d at 268; <span class="Italic">see also Elliott v. Group Medical &#x0026; Surgical Service</span>, 714 F.2d 556, 567 (5th Cir. 1983). We agree with the district court, and hold that a reasonable jury could not consider the fact that Seifert asked Woythal about his future plans to be evidence of intentional age discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the court in <span class="Italic">Woythal, supra</span> at 247-48, determined that based on the circumstances present, the hiring of a younger person was not evidence of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Woythal argues, however, that these questions coupled with the hiring of Bill Soltes the day after Woythal left Tex-Tenn provide evidence that it was Tex-Tenn's clever plan to pressure him to retire, and when that didn't work, to then fire him and replace him with someone younger. Woythal initially agreed to the hiring of an assistant, however, and Seifert and Carico had made preparations to hire Soltes long before Woythal left Tex-Tenn. It is evident from the accounts of the interviews that Seifert and Carico did not intend to hire Soltes as a replacement for Woythal as the Chief Engineer; rather, he was to be an assistant. He only achieved the position as Chief Engineer as quickly as he did because Woythal's employment ended. This incident is more coincidental and innocent than orchestrated and sinister, as Woythal insists. We do not think a reasonable jury would be convinced that Seifert and Carico planned this turn of events in advance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, Woythal cannot succeed in showing that Tex-Tenn's reasons for his departure from that company are pretext for age discrimination.</p>
