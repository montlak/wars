<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-63"><span class="space">F.</span> SYSTEMIC OR RECURRING VIOLATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">A third category that the Commission has routinely mislabeled as continuing violations is the maintenance of an alleged discriminatory employment policy or practice. Such violations are referred to as "systemic" or "recurring violations." It was the EEOC's view that, as long as the policy or practice was maintained during that period, it was not necessary that the complainant actually suffer any adverse effects during the 45-day period. It became less than clear whether the Supreme Court would embrace the EEOC's position on this latter point, especially in the wake of <span class="Italic">Morgan, supra</span>. That uncertainty became reality when the Supreme Court addressed the issue in <span class="Italic">Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.</span>, 127 S. Ct. 2162 (2007), in which the Court rejected the EEOC view. The Supreme Court's decision was short-lived, however, when on January 29, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-2.</p>
<p class="noindent">One question that arose in light of <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> was whether each new event triggered the statute of limitations or the limitations period began to run when the policy or practice was first implemented. The Commission's position had consistently been that each occurrence constituted a new violation and, thus, the limitations started again. For example, in <span class="Italic">Amft v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a40116.txt">07A40116</a> (2006), the complainants brought a class action complaint alleging that a pay demonstration project at the FAA discriminated against them on the basis of sex. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Amft</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> to determine the reviewable time frame, the AJ found the period of May 9, 1994 to June 22, 1994 as the relevant period for purposes of defining the present class. In <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> the Supreme Court expressly relied on its statement in <span class="Italic">Bazemore v. Friday,</span> 478 U.S. 385, 395 (1986), regarding each paycheck paid <span id="Page_92"></span>at a discriminatory rate as an example of an actionable "discrete act or single occurrence, even when it has a connection to other acts." <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> at 111, 122 S. Ct. 2061 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Hildebrandt v. Illinois Department of Human Resources,</span> 347 F.3d 1014, 1028 (7th Cir. 2003); EEOC Compliance Manual "Threshold Issues Sect. 2-IV Timeliness" (issued July 21, 2005) (Compliance Manual). The Court did not characterize <span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> as involving a "continuing violation" or as embracing a continuing violation doctrine. Instead, the Court reaffirmed the <span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> statement that each discriminatory paycheck was a separate discriminatory act. <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> at 2071. Therefore, reading <span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> in light of <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> as long as one incident of alleged disparate pay occurred within the time limits for bringing the claim, the complaint should be accepted for investigation. However, a complainant "cannot make timely any prior time-barred discrete acts of discriminatory pay by filing within the time frame of one discriminatory paycheck." <span class="Italic">Hildebrandt,</span> at 1027.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing, we find that the AJ properly found that each of the class agents paychecks that included discriminatory pay was a discrete discriminatory act, not subject to the continuing violation doctrine. Under <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> the class agents cannot incorporate into their claim any paychecks received prior to 45 days from their having received EEO counseling. Therefore, the period of May 9, 1994 to June 22, 1994 is the relevant period for purposes of defining the class. The class shall remain defined as:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All female employees who held an administrative position assigned to one of the FAA facilities identified as a participating facility (Los Angeles, Oakland, New York, and Chicago) under the June 1989 Pay Demonstration Project and who were entitled to an incentive pay during the period of May 9, 1994 to June 22, 1994, if their position had been identified as a position covered under the Pay Demonstration Project.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC, in its Technical Assistance Manual, <span class="Italic">Employer EEO Responsibilities</span>, Tab L at pp. 374-77 (2002), further explained it position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A systemic violation is a continuing violation in which an employer maintains a discriminatory policy or practice that continues into the statutory 180/300-day filing period. A challenge to a systemic violation that continues into the filing period is timely if brought by an employee or applicant directly affected by the policy, even if there is no specific application of the policy within the filing period. If an employee is discriminatorily discharged pursuant to a discriminatory policy or practice, however, a charge generally must be filed within 180/300 days of the discharge. This is because after discharge, the former employee will no longer be subjected to the discriminatory policy or practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A systemic violation will usually take the form of a discriminatory policy or practice.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> Discriminatory policy: Formal policy that differentially treats or has a disparate impact on members of a protected group.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> Discriminatory practice: Although there is no formal policy that is discriminatory, the respondent engages in a discriminatory practice over an extended period of time. For example, the employer may have a practice of paying African-Americans lower wages for performing the same work as whites, or a longstanding practice of ignoring widespread sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The charging party is not required to prove the existence of a discriminatory policy or practice before a charge is accepted. In some situations, a charging party will not explicitly allege that the respondent had a discriminatory policy or practice. However, specific factual allegations about widespread and/or longstanding discrimination can point to the existence of a systemic violation. For example, systemic discrimination can be inferred from the following facts showing widespread discrimination against women in the areas of promotion, compensation, and training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because an individual affected by a discriminatory policy or practice is continuously subjected to discrimination by the mere existence of the policy or practice, it is not always necessary that a specific application of the discriminatory policy or practice involving the individual have occurred within the limitations period. For example, if a company maintains a promotion system that discriminates against women, each day that a qualified woman does not receive a promotion is a violation of Title VII. Alternatively, because a discriminatory hiring policy may discourage a qualified applicant from applying for a position, it is unnecessary for the charging party to have been rejected pursuant to the discriminatory policy during the filing period, as long as s/he was subjected to the policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 1&#x2003;Respondent has a formal, written personnel policy providing insurance coverage for its employees' resident children but denying coverage for their nonresident children. CP, a male employee of Respondent, alleges that the policy has a disparate impact on the basis of sex because divorced women are far more likely than divorced men to have custody of their children. Under the circumstances, CP has alleged a systemic continuing violation; therefore, as long as the policy continues into the filing period, the charge would be timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 2&#x2003;CP alleges that she is being subjected to wage discrimination. Respondent does not have a written policy providing that women are paid less than men. However, an investigation reveals that for over two years CP has been paid approximately 20 percent less than similarly situated males coworkers. Because this discriminatory practice continues into the filing period, CP's charge is timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the TAC refers to the private sector charge-filing period, it should be read as invoking the 45-day period for initiating counseling in federal sector cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">In situations involving allegations of a systemic or recurring violation, the Commission imposed no requirement that the complainant be previously unaware of the alleged discrimination. In <span class="Italic">McCubbins v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01964090 (1997), the Commission enunciated why it believed the reasonable suspicion standard was inapplicable in cases of a recurring violation; that is, situations in which every day a policy or practice exists constitutes a new violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant filed an EEO complaint alleging that she was discriminated against on the basis of sex (female) when from September 1994 onward she was not paid at the GS-11 level. However, this time limit is subject to extension under the continuing violation rule. Under this theory, as applied to cases concerning unequal pay for equal work on a continuing basis, appellant's EEO contact was timely as her allegation concerns a recurring violation, and she contacted an EEO counselor within 45 days of receiving the allegedly unequal pay<span class="Italic">. Robinson v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950558 (July 1, 1996). In cases such as this, the reasonable suspicion standard is inapplicable. Otherwise, the agency would be able to continue its alleged discrimination in perpetuity with no available remedy for the complainant<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Accordingly, the agency's dismissal of appellant's complaint is reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05991136 (2002) (holding reasonable suspicion standard is inapplicable to Equal Pay Act cases).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission held in such cases that relief was limited to those instances that involve the effect of the policy within the limitations period. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ward v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60047 (2006), the complainant alleged that a discriminatory miscoding of her pay status since 1984 had resulted in being charged with over 14,000 hours of leave without pay and had also negatively impacted on her service credit for retirement purposes. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complaint as untimely, but noted that the complaint would be limited only to those occurrences within 45 days of the start of counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Ledbetter</span>, the EEOC's view seemed bolstered by language in <span class="Italic">Bazemore v. Friday</span>, 478 U.S. 385, 395, 106 S. Ct. 3000, 3006 92 L. Ed.2d 315 (1986), to the effect that salary discrimination remained actionable under Title VII because "[e]ach week's paycheck that deliver[ed] less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII...."</p>
<p class="noindent">In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court tossed out the long-standing EEOC timeliness doctrine that allowed employees to file claims alleging discrimination in the payment of wages as long as a paycheck had been received within the statute of limitations period, regardless of when the decision affecting pay was made. In <span class="Italic">Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.,</span> a sharply divided Court held that the time period for filing claims alleging discriminatory pay disparities under Title VII begins at the time of the decision affecting pay and that, contrary to EEOC policy, each paycheck did not constitute a new violation. The decision immediately prompted Democrats in the House of Representatives to introduce legislation to overturn the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ledbetter</span>, the petitioner worked for Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber in a salaried position from 1979 to 1998. Like her male counterparts, Ledbetter's raises were based on supervisors' performance evaluations. In 1998, Ledbetter brought suit against Goodyear under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act alleging that she had been paid less than her male counterparts. The District Court granted Goodyear summary judgment on the EPA and several other claims. On the Title VII claim, Ledbetter introduced evidence that she had been given discriminatory performance evaluations earlier in her career because of her sex and that, by the end of her employment, she was paid substantially less than her male counterparts. The jury found in her favor and awarded back pay and damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding Ledbetter had not proved any intentional discrimination within the statute of limitations period, but only that she continued to be affected by previous discriminatory decisions during that period. The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> and a majority opinion, written by Justice Alito, rejected the notion that each paycheck was a separate act of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying upon a line of cases that included <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,</span> 431 U.S. 553 (1977), <span class="Italic">Delaware State College v. Ricks</span>, 449 U.S. 250 (1980), <span class="Italic">Lorance v. AT&#x0026;T Technologies</span>, Inc., 490 U.S. 900 (1989), and <span class="Italic">National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), Justice Alito wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_93"></span>The instruction provided by <span class="Italic">Evans, Ricks, Lorance,</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> is clear. The EEOC charging period is triggered when a discrete unlawful practice takes place. A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent non-discriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination. But of course, if an employer engages in a series of acts each of which is intentionally discriminatory, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed. <span class="Italic">See Morgan, supra,</span> at 113.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ledbetter's arguments here--that the paychecks that she received during the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title VII and triggered a new EEOC charging period--cannot be reconciled with <span class="Italic">Evans, Ricks, Lorance,</span> and<span class="Italic"> Morgan.</span> Ledbetter, as noted, makes no claim that intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the charging period or that discriminatory decisions that occurred prior to that period were not communicated to her. Instead, she argues simply that Goodyear's conduct during the charging period gave present effect to discriminatory conduct outside of that period. But current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination; as we held in <span class="Italic">Evans,</span> such effects in themselves have "no present legal consequences." 431 U.S., at 558. Ledbetter should have filed an EEOC charge within 180 days after each allegedly discriminatory pay decision was made and communicated to her. She did not do so, and the paychecks that were issued to her during the 180 days prior to the filing of her EEOC charge do not provide a basis for overcoming that prior failure.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding that adopting Ledbetter's view would essentially eliminate the element of intent from Title VII claims, the majority next focused on the Title VII procedural scheme, which places on employees the burden of coming forward with claims quickly to protect employers from stale claims. Justice Alito wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC filing deadline "protect[s] employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past." <span class="Italic">Ricks, supra,</span> at 256-257. Certainly, the 180-day EEOC charging deadline, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(e)(1), is short by any measure, but "[b]y choosing what are obviously quite short deadlines, Congress clearly intended to encourage the prompt processing of all charges of employment discrimination." <span class="Italic">Mohasco, supra,</span> at 825. This short deadline reflects Congress' strong preference for the prompt resolution of employment discrimination allegations through voluntary conciliation and cooperation. <span class="Italic">Occidental Life Ins., supra,</span> at 367-368; <span class="Italic">Alexander, supra,</span> at 44.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A disparate-treatment claim comprises two elements: an employment practice, and discriminatory intent. Nothing in Title VII supports treating the intent element of Ledbetter's claim any differently from the employment practice element. If anything, concerns regarding stale claims weigh more heavily with respect to proof of the intent associated with employment practices than with the practices themselves. For example, in a case such as this in which the plaintiff's claim concerns the denial of raises, the employer's challenged acts (the decisions not to increase the employee's pay at the times in question) will almost always be documented and will typically not even be in dispute. By contrast, the employer's intent is almost always disputed, and evidence relating to intent may fade quickly with time. In most disparate-treatment cases, much if not all of the evidence of intent is circumstantial. Thus, the critical issue in a case involving a long-past performance evaluation will often be whether the evaluation was so far off the mark that a sufficient inference of discriminatory intent can be drawn. <span class="Italic">See Watson,</span> 487 U.S., at 1004 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that in a disparate-treatment claim, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> factors establish discrimination by inference). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Zhuang v. Datacard Corp.,</span> 414 F. 3d 849 (CA8 2005) (rejecting inference of discrimination from performance evaluations); <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Southern Co.,</span> 390 F. 3d 695, 732-733 (CA11 2004) (same). This can be a subtle determination, and the passage of time may seriously diminish the ability of the parties and the factfinder to reconstruct what actually happened.</p>
<p class="noindent">The next order of business for the majority was to distinguish <span class="Italic">Bazemore v. Friday</span>, 478 U.S. 385 (1986), a <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> opinion in which the Court said "[e]ach week's paycheck that delivers less to a black than a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII." Alito explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> concerned a disparate-treatment pay claim brought against the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, 478 U.S., at 389-390. Service employees were oriGINAlly segregated into "a white branch" and "a 'Negro branch,'" with the latter receiving less pay, but in 1965 the two branches were merged. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 390-391. After Title VII was extended to public employees in 1972, black employees brought suit claiming that pay disparities attributable to the old dual pay scale persisted. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 391. The Court of Appeals rejected this claim, which it interpreted to be that the "'discriminatory difference in salaries should have been affirmatively eliminated.'" <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 395.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court reversed in a <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> opinion, 478 U.S., at 386-388, but all of the Members of the Court joined Justice Brennan's separate opinion, <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> at 388 (opinion concurring in part). Justice Brennan wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"The error of the Court of Appeals with respect to salary disparities created prior to 1972 and perpetuated thereafter is too obvious to warrant extended discussion: that the Extension Service discriminated with respect to salaries prior to the time it was covered by Title VII does not excuse perpetuating that discrimination after the Extension Service became covered by Title VII. To hold otherwise would have the effect of exempting from liability those employers who were historically the greatest offenders of the rights of blacks. A pattern or practice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became a violation upon Title VII's effective date, and to the extent an employer continued to engage in that act or practice, it is liable under that statute. While recovery may not be permitted for pre-1972 acts of discrimination, to the extent that this discrimination was perpetuated after 1972, liability may be imposed."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 395 (emphasis in oriGINAl).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Far from adopting the approach that Ledbetter advances here, this passage made a point that was "too obvious to warrant extended discussion," <span class="Italic">ibid.;</span> namely, that when an employer adopts a facially discriminatory pay structure that puts some employees on a lower scale because of race, the employer engages in intentional discrimination whenever it issues a check to one of these disfavored employees. An employer that adopts and intentionally retains such a pay structure can surely be regarded as intending to discriminate on the basis of race as long as the structure is used.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Bazemore</span> thus is entirely consistent with our prior precedents, as Justice Brennan's opinion took care to point out. Noting that <span class="Italic">Evans</span> turned on whether "'any <span class="Italic">present violation</span> exist[ed],'" Justice Brennan stated that the Bazemore plaintiffs were alleging that the defendants "ha[d] not from the date of the Act forward made all their employment decisions in a wholly nondiscriminatory way," 478 U.S., at 396-397, n.6 (emphasis in oriGINAl; internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)--which is to say that they had engaged in fresh discrimination. Justice Brennan added that the Court's "holding in no sense g[ave] legal effect to the pre-1972 actions, but, consistent with <span class="Italic">Evans</span>...focuse[d] on the present salary structure, which is illegal if it <span class="Italic">is a mere continuation of the pre-1965 discriminatory pay structure." Id.,</span> at 397, n.6 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sentence in Justice Brennan's opinion on which Ledbetter chiefly relies comes directly after the passage quoted above, and makes a similarly obvious point:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Each week's paycheck that delivers less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII, regardless of the fact that this pattern was begun prior to the effective date of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 395.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other words, a freestanding violation may always be charged within its own charging period regardless of its connection to other violations. We repeated this same point more recently in <span class="Italic">Morgan:</span> "The existence of past acts and the employee's prior knowledge of their occurrence...does not bar employees from filing charges about related discrete acts so long as the acts are independently discriminatory and charges addressing those acts are themselves timely filed." 536 U.S., at 113. Neither of these opinions stands for the proposition that an action not comprising an employment practice and alleged discriminatory intent is separately chargeable, just because it is related to some past act of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority rejected the argument that lower courts routinely hear claims under the EPA, which prohibits sex-based wage discrimination, that arise outside of the limitations period. The Court noted that Title VII and the EPA are different statutes and that administrative exhaustion of remedies is not required under the EPA.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the majority brushed aside the suggestion that it should grant deference to the EEOC's interpretation of the statute of limitations with respect to pay claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">The dissent, written by Justice Ginsburg, got right to the point on the effect of the majority's ruling in pay disparity cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court's insistence on immediate contest overlooks common characteristics of pay discrimination. Pay disparities often occur, as they did in Ledbetter's case, in small increments; cause to suspect that discrimination is at work develops only over time. Comparative pay information, moreover, is often hidden from the employee's view. Employers may keep under wraps the pay differentials maintained among supervisors, no less the reasons for those differentials. Small initial discrepancies may not be seen as meet for a federal case, particularly when the employee, trying to succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse to making waves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pay disparities are thus significantly different from adverse actions "such as termination, failure to promote,...or refusal to hire," all involving fully communicated discrete acts, "easy to identify" as discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan,</span> 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002). It is only when the disparity becomes apparent and sizable, e.g., through future raises calculated as a percentage of current salaries, that <span id="Page_94"></span>an employee in Ledbetter's situation is likely to comprehend her plight and, therefore, to complain. Her initial readiness to give her employer the benefit of the doubt should not preclude her from later challenging the then current and continuing payment of a wage depressed on account of her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ledbetter's petition presents a question important to the sound application of Title VII: What activity qualifies as an unlawful employment practice in cases of discrimination with respect to compensation. One answer identifies the pay-setting decision, and that decision alone, as the unlawful practice. Under this view, each particular salary-setting decision is discrete from prior and subsequent decisions, and must be challenged within 180 days on pain of forfeiture. Another response counts both the pay-setting decision and the actual payment of a discriminatory wage as unlawful practices. Under this approach, each payment of a wage or salary infected by sex-based discrimination constitutes an unlawful employment practice; prior decisions, outside the 180-day charge-filing period, are not themselves actionable, but they are relevant in determining the lawfulness of conduct within the period. The Court adopts the first view,<span class="Italic"> see ante</span>, at 1, 4, 9, but the second is more faithful to precedent, more in tune with the realities of the workplace, and more respectful of Title VII's remedial purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent">The dissent proceeded to make a point by point rebuttal of the majority's arguments likening pay disparity cases to hostile environment claims discussed in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>. Noting that often salaries and wages of coworkers are kept private, the Justice Ginsburg wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The problem of concealed pay discrimination is particularly acute where the disparity arises not because the female employee is flatly denied a raise but because male counterparts are given larger raises. Having received a pay increase, the female employee is unlikely to discern at once that she has experienced an adverse employment decision. She may have little reason even to suspect discrimination until a pattern develops incrementally and she ultimately becomes aware of the disparity. Even if an employee suspects that the reason for a comparatively low raise is not performance but sex (or another protected ground), the amount involved may seem too small, or the employer's intent too ambiguous, to make the issue immediately actionable--or winnable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further separating pay claims from the discrete employment actions identified in <span class="Italic">Morgan,</span> an employer gains from sex-based pay disparities in a way it does not from a discriminatory denial of promotion, hiring, or transfer. When a male employee is selected over a female for a higher level position, someone still gets the promotion and is paid a higher salary; the employer is not enriched. But when a woman is paid less than a similarly situated man, the employer reduces its costs each time the pay differential is implemented. Furthermore, decisions on promotions, like decisions installing seniority systems, often implicate the interests of third-party employees in a way that pay differentials do not. <span class="Italic">Cf. Teamsters v. United States,</span> 431 U.S. 324, 352-353 (1977) (recognizing that seniority systems involve "vested...rights of employees" and concluding that Title VII was not intended to "destroy or water down" those rights). Disparate pay, by contrast, can be remedied at any time solely at the expense of the employer who acts in a discriminatory fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Ginsburg closed the dissent by noting congressional action in the 1991 Civil Rights Act to overrule the <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> and <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> cases, and added "the Legislature may act to correct this Court's parsimonious reading of Title VII.</p>
