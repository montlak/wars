<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-136"><span class="space">e.</span> $20,001-$25,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30112.txt">07A30112</a> (2004), the Commission upheld an award of $22,000 where nearly 20 months expired before the complainant was reinstated. The complainant and his fianc&#x00E9;e testified that he suffered from extreme anxiety while looking for alternative work for six months. They also testified that he had difficulty sleeping, was irritable and agitated, and responded negatively to loved ones. In addition, the complainant suffered from depression. Finally, the Commission found that the discrimination compounded distress over other events in the complainant's life, such as his mother's serious illness and the death of an uncle.<span class="Italic"> See also</span> <span class="Italic">Minna Z. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720160009 (2017) (awarding $25,000 where the agency failed to engage in the interactive process to find the complainant a reasonable accommodation for her disability, resulting complainant's insomnia, depression, migraines, anxiety, humiliation, damage to the complainant's professional reputation, diminished quality of life, damage to relationships with friends and family members, and the complainant's preexisting mental and physical conditions).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $4,000 was increased to $22,500 in <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A1904 (2002), where the complainant's distress was severe but of limited duration. The Commission also noted the agency's discrimination was the primary cause in exacerbating the complainant's preexisting condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">A bit of an unusual award by the administrative judge in the amount of $23,375.00 was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Elbert H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140032 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant said that the termination "was a terrible blow" and that "[i]t still chokes me up to this day." Hearing Transcript, July 31, 2012 (HT II), p. 153. He said it was a terrible embarrassment and that he would avoid other people, such as his in-laws, out of shame. "I felt like I had failed. It was a tough road. It was a lot of shame." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant said his blood pressure increased, as did his weight. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., pp. 155-56. Complainant's wife testified that he:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">started feeling depressed because he wasn't cooking dinner, wasn't folding clothes. He had actually stopped working out. He would usually work out just about every day. And he put on about 20 pounds. He's a fitness fanatic, I would say. And, like, at night he would <span id="Page_1853"></span>just go down to the basement and sleep down in the basement. He wouldn't even come upstairs to the bedroom and sleep. would find him downstairs in the morning when I would get ready to go to work. ...It's very personal but we weren't intimate at all. You know, that's something that's real personal that I don't like to talk about.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">HT I, pp. 130-31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find the AJ's award of $23,375.00 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. We note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damage amounts similar to the amount awarded in this case. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080062 (Feb. 26, 2009) (following discriminatory non-selection, complainant was awarded $25,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant endured emotional pain and suffering, humiliation, difficulty sleeping, weight gain, and loss of enjoyment of life); <span class="Italic">Utt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070001 (Mar. 26, 2009) ($25,000 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where complainant provided testimony that as a result of discrimination he suffered from stress, low self-esteem, difficulty sleeping and weight gain); <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070077 (Nov. 13, 2009) ($20,000 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where complainant suffered damage to her professional reputation and emotional distress that affected her family due to discriminatory nonselections); <span class="Italic">Flowers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43114 (Oct, 7, 2004), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A50243 (Jan. 11, 2005) ($20,000 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where the agency's failure to hire complainant resulted in sleeplessness, depression, emotional distress, anxiety, loss of enjoyment of life and strained family relationships). We conclude that an award of $23,375.00 will adequately compensate Complainant for the emotional harm he suffered as a result of the reprisal. Therefore, we affirm the AJ's award of compensatory damages here.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $25,000 was made by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Hogeland v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01976440 (1999), where the complainant produced evidence that withdrawal of an accommodation aggravated a previously-existing depression that caused headaches and abdominal pains. Prior to loss of the accommodation, the complainant was on multiple medications leading her physicians to worry about complications from toxicity. The physicians linked the accommodation of leave without pay to a "delicate balance" the complainant maintained. After she was no longer allowed to take the leave, she elevated her medications requiring inpatient detoxification. An award of $25,000 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Cornejo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994280 (2002), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant aggravated the symptoms of her tendinitis, causing her physical pain and resulting in further deterioration of her condition. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kiara R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152620 (2017) (awarding $25,000 where the agency delayed providing a reasonable accommodation for 22 months).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission approved an award of $25,000 in damages where the complainant suffered from prolonged feelings of frustration, anger, loss of self-esteem, and betrayal. <span class="Italic">Hatton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985377 (2000). In upholding the award of the administrative judge, the Commission credited the complainant's testimony that the agency's actions in declaring him physically unfit for duty caused him to "lose faith in the system" and exacerbated his distress.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">George v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A04425 (2002), the Commission increased an agency award of $3,000 in damages to $25,000 where the complainant submitted evidence from two physicians that established her elevated blood sugar levels coincided with the onset of the sexual harassment, and that several months later she was diagnosed with diabetes and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the emotional distress from a nonselection lasted approximately 19 months, the Commission awarded $25,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01125 (2002). The complainant testified that he became depressed and went on drinking bouts, shied away from contact with coworkers, stopped participating in civic affairs and, in testimony corroborated by his wife, became agitated and all but ended sexual relations with her.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case where the Commission characterized the harm as severe but of limited duration, it awarded $25,000. In <span class="Italic">Chaparro v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A03785 (2002), the complainant underwent a series of physical examinations for gastro-intestinal problems, an EKG for chest pains and numbness in his left arm, and a brain-scan for tension headaches. None of the examinations revealed any physical problem.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A20720 (2002), the Commission upheld an agency damage award of $25,000 where the discrimination resulted in fainting, sleeplessness, depression, anxiety attacks, and substance abuse. Where severe emotional distress lasted approximately one year, the Commission awarded $25,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A21633 (2003). During the time that the complainant was attempting to obtain a reassignment, she commuted four hours per day and was severely restricted from attending to her sick mother. This caused the complainant to experience anguish and guilt over not being wit her mother. Several other symptoms appeared after her mother died. The Commission found that, although the complainant's depression was caused by her mother's death, it was exacerbated by the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A30075 (2003), the Commission awarded $25,000 in damages where the complainant suffered from depression and anger for approximately one year and had several instances where her hypertension was severely aggravated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Price v. Attorney General</span>, 07A20104 (2003), the Commission reduced the administrative judge's award of $40,000 to $25,000 for the emotional harm the complainant suffered as a result of a five-day suspension. In part, the Commission found that the complainant's emotional distress was caused by marital problems unrelated to the discrimination and by the stress of litigating the case. In a case short on detail, the Commission increased an agency damages award of $5,000 to $25,000 rejecting the agency's argument that a transfer to a different work location should have ended the complainant's emotional distress. In <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A23791 (2003), the Commission noted the supervisor who had not selected the complainant continued to have supervisory responsibility over the complainant even after the transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A35286 (2004), the Commission increased an agency award of $18,500 to $25,000 even though some of the complainant's emotional distress could be attributed to other factors. In <span class="Italic">Hoffman</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the appropriate award in this case, we find the agency's award of $18,500.00 insufficient to adequately compensate complainant for his emotional distress due to the discrimination. While the FAD correctly notes that some of complainant's depression and emotional distress could be attributed to factors unrelated to the discrimination, such as his move from New York to Minnesota, we find it disingenuous of the agency to argue that between July 1997 and December of 1998, his condition resulted from factors unrelated to requiring him to work on Sundays. Instead, a review of the record makes it clear that complainant's depression and emotional problems which required him to see a psychiatrist and take medication we exacerbated when complainant was informed that the work-swapping arrangement was ending. It is precisely the decision to require complainant to work on Sundays that we found to constitute discrimination in our prior decision. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A01092 (June 29, 2001). Any additional stress and/or depression resulting from the decision to end complainant's work-swapping arrangement and from the subsequent requirement that he work Sundays in violation of his religious beliefs, or use FMLA leave, therefore, resulted ultimately from the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several Commission decisions have addressed compensatory damages in cases similar to complainant's. <span class="Italic">See Terrel v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996) ($25,000.00 awarded where complainant was hurt, embarrassed, withdrawn, and reclusive, and suffered marriage difficulties, crying, weight-loss, and loss of self-esteem, but symptoms in part were due to issues unrelated to agency's discrimination); <span class="Italic">Hogeland v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976440 (June 14, 1999) ($25,000.00 awarded where agency's action led to aggravation of complainant's preexisting depression, headaches, and abdominal pain); <span class="Italic">Flythe v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972258 (April 11, 2000) ($30,000.00 awarded for complainant's anger, pain, frustration, severe anxiety, marital tension, irritability, and nervousness). Given the above, we find that the evidence supports an award of $25,000.00. This amount takes into account the severity and the duration of the harm done to complainant by the agency s action, as well as the fact that a portion of complainant's emotional harm pre-dates the agency's action. The Commission further notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) (<span class="Italic">citing Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)); <span class="Italic">USEEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd.,</span> 823 F. Supp. 573, 574 (N.D. 111 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Siddiqui v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A35415 (2004), the Commission increased an agency award of $5,000 to $25,000 where the complainant alleged that several agency actions resulted in a heart attack. The Commission found that only one of the actions complained of--the agency's failure to provide religious accommodation--was discriminatory and that the complainant had a preexisting coronary condition. However, it also found the agency's failure to accommodate resulted in extreme distress, anxiety attacks, sleeplessness, inability to focus and weight loss.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where, after being terminated, the complainant was diagnosed as being HIV-positive, the Commission awarded $25,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Howen v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a42618.txt">01A42618</a> (2004), the Commission found the complainant's testimony that the termination affected him more than the diagnosis to be not credible. In also awarding $10,000 in future pecuniary damages, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Howen</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the record indicates that complainant testified that he took anti-depressants occasionally both before and after the <span id="Page_1854"></span>HIV diagnosis, well before his receipt of the agency's first FAD which found discrimination. After consideration of the evidence, we find no contrary evidence submitted by the agency disputing the diagnosis of complainant's physician stating that complainant's PTSD was triggered by the finding of discrimination in 2003. However, in contradicting the physician's diagnosis of PTSD due to the termination, we note the HIV diagnosis, the fact that complainant sought no psychiatric care in the four (4) years after the termination and complainant's somewhat incredible assertion that the termination affected him emotionally more than the diagnosis of a life-threatening disease. Further, we find it difficult to credit complainant's assertion that his PTSD was triggered by the agency's FAD, which found that he had been discriminated against by the agency and offered remedies to compensate him. Nevertheless, based on the diagnosis of complainant's treating physician, we will order the agency to compensate complainant in the amount of $10,000.00 in future pecuniary damages for psychiatric expenses related to his PTSD. Further, the complainant is awarded $750.00 in medication costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Thibault v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A34585.txt">01A34585</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $25,000 in damages where the complainant had been seeking psychological treatment for several years before the discrimination, but most of the recent symptoms were attributed to the agency's discriminatory cancelation of her detail and assignment to a less prestigious position. Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sang G. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120151360 (2017), found that the agency's award of $15,000 did not adequately address the "long term suffering" of the complainant and increased the award to $25,000, noting the complainant's emotional distress as well as that of his families' and his inability to gain employment which worsened his depression.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $4,500 by the administrative judge was increased to $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Pachecano v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A32170.txt">01A32170</a> (2004), where the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has presented a letter dated November 9, 1998, from MJ, a physician at the Veteran's Health Care Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Clinic, who states that "ongoing stressors such as lack of promotion at your work...has [sic] aggravated your condition." Complainant's Brief, Unnumbered Attachment. Additional correspondence from MJ dated April 12, 1999 states that "the job stressors continue to be an ongoing source of stress and to worsen the PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder symptoms...[which] continue to cause occupational and social impairment."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Correspondence from MJ dated October 14, 1999, states that complainant retired from his job with the agency "due to the severity of his PTSD symptoms...[and that he] was in a very stressful work environment which exacerbated his condition."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Correspondence from PF, a personal friend of complainant's, dated December 12, 2002, states that after complainant was not promoted, "he was depressed, seldom talking or laughing when we got together." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> PF further stated that complainant had told him that being passed over for promotion had made him sick and that complainant "seldom left his house socially, quit answering his telephone, and finally stopped responding to messages I left on his recorder."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Complainant's wife reported complainant exhibited moodiness, alienation, depression, solitude, and reclusiveness.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Another friend and former colleague (FC) said that complainant was never the same after he was not promoted, and that he became depressed, angry, less vocal, and FC once saw him crying.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's award of $3,000 was increased to $25,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Silcox v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A46160 (2005), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claimed that since the alleged harassment and retaliation, she has experienced: stress related diarrhea, chest pains, loss of half of her hair, trouble sleeping, lines in her forehead, loss of appetite, and lack of energy. She also asserted that she felt that her job was threatened. She noted that she did not play softball in 2003 or 2004 because of what she called the "nonsense at work." Complainant indicated that her daughter was affected by the agency's action and that her daughter's focus at school has deteriorated because she worries about complainant. Complainant also was under the care of a physician for high stress and diarrhea associated with the work environment. Finally, complainant asserted that she used to take pride in her work until she was essentially told that if she complained, her job would be on the line.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record included a statement from the Union President. Since complainant received the letter of counseling, the Union President indicated that complainant complained to him about work every week for a year. Complainant's friend also averred that complainant had weight problems, hair thinning, chest pains, and problems sleeping since the agency's actions. The friend noted that complainant felt as if she was targeted from the very beginning when she started at the agency. Because of the alleged incidents at work, the friend also indicated that complainant felt more like an outsider. Upon review, however, it appears that the friend was referring to all the alleged incidents of harassment that occurred at the agency rather than just the letter of counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission noted that the complainant could not be compensated for the harm allegedly suffered by her daughter.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kallauner v. Secretary of Energy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a40943.txt">01A40943</a> (2005), the Commission increased an award of $15,000 by its administrative judge to $25,000. In addition to noting that the judge cited no case law in support of the $15,000 award, the Commission noted that complainant suffered from insomnia, depression, anxiety and chest pains, some 55% of which was attributed to the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Zobel v. Postmaster General</span>, 07200500351 (2006), where the complainant was emotionally upset and unstable, screamed at her children, and could not cook dinner or otherwise take care of them. The Commission found that not all of the complainant's emotional distress could be attributed to the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $5,000 in damages by an administrative judge to $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Ansari v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720070054 (2007), where the discrimination caused severe emotional distress that contributed to the complainant's separation from his wife. The Commission also noted a past history of seizures, which recurred during the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Torres v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120064872 (2008), the Commission increased an agency award of $10,000 to $25,000 based on both the duration and the severity of the harm. In increasing the award, the Commission noted that the agency had already conceded that the complainant established a nexus between the hostile environment and at least some of the harm he suffered. However, the Commission also noted that two incidents the complainant claimed had caused some of the distress were not before the Commission in the current case. In finding that $25,000 was the appropriate award, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Torres</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the incidents which created the hostile work environment began in November 1993 and continued until complainant was terminated in March 1995. Complainant stated that due to the discrimination he felt "massive depression along with extreme physical disorders causing me to isolate myself from everyone and everything around me." He also said that he no longer "feels the need to laugh with or socialize with his family." Complainant also provided medical documentation that he began receiving treatment for anxiety and pain beginning on August 16, 1994. The record also reveals that on February 20, 1995, a clinical psychiatrist diagnosed complainant as having "Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Failures" with moderate depression. Complainant was later diagnosed as suffering from "Major Depressive Disorder." Complainant's wife and daughter both submitted affidavits stating that because of the hostile work environment created by complainant's supervisor, complainant gave up on life and alienated his family at home. Complainant's daughter stated that complainant was no longer the loving and happy father he had been before the hostile work environment began and his short temper and high stress drove her siblings away from home. Complainant's wife stated that he brought the stress from work home and became cruel and verbally abusive to her and their children. She stated that she was forced to quit working because she could not leave him alone after she discovered him attempting to commit suicide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that this record indicates that complainant's medical condition was exacerbated after he was forced to submit to a drug test that he claims was discriminatory, and worsened even more after he was removed from his position at work. Complainant's wife also stated that after he lost his job, the family was evicted from their home and lived in their car for a year. We note initially, that the claims concerning the alleged discriminatory drug test and removal are not currently before the Commission. As such, we find that complainant's entitlement to compensatory damages is tempered by these considerations. We are persuaded however, that complainant's suicide attempt and homelessness, though occurring subsequent to when the harassment had ceased, were at least partially caused by the discriminatory harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining compensatory damages, the Commission strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases. Insofar as complainant has submitted evidence via testimony of emotional distress and medical documentation of treatment, we note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to complainant's in terms of harm sustained. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Hatchett v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05990121 (November 3, 2000) (awarding $20,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant was harassed and issued a letter of removal which was later reduced to a suspension; specific harm included: worsening of complainant's anxiety and depression, withdrawal from family and friends, anger and suspicion); <span class="Italic">Mooney v. United States Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974494 (May 24, 2000) (awarding $20,000.00 where complainant submitted medical documentation that she suffered from depression and anxiety for 6-7 months followed by 4-5 month period of Major Depression due to agency's discrimination); <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied,</span> EEOC <span id="Page_1855"></span>Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997) (awarding $25,000.00 where complainant suffered sleep problems, depression, mental anguish, loss of relationships with his wife, family, and friends, lasting approximately two and a half years, but mitigated by evidence that other factors unrelated to agency's discrimination contributed). We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are intended to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,</span> 477 U.S. 299, 31112 (1986) (stating that a compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After analyzing the medical documentation and testimony evidence which establish the harm sustained by complainant, with note of the serious nature and duration of his suffering, and upon consideration of damage awards reached in comparable cases, the Commission finds that $10,000.00 is inadequate to compensate complainant, and that he is entitled to an award of non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $25,000.00. Therefore, after a careful review of the record, including arguments and evidence not specifically addressed in this decision, the agency's July 27, 2006 final decision is hereby MODIFIED, and the agency is ordered to comply with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency damage award of $7,500 to $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120072458 (2008), where sexual harassment of the complainant led to stress, nausea, weight gain, nervousness, and strained family relations including the dissolution of her 20-year marriage. In making the award, the Commission also noted that several stress factors not related to the agency's discrimination had contributed to the complainant's condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $25,000 in damages in a case where the evidence was submitted on appeal in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120072400 (2009). In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the administrative judge did not advise the complainant of the need to submit damages evidence at the hearing. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of his claim for non-pecuniary damages, complainant has submitted written testimony, and several additional statements (none of which were refuted by the agency) from individuals who confirm that complainant endured emotional and psychological harm directly because of the retaliatory conduct of management in this case. Complainant has presented testimony that, as a direct result of learning that the Chief ALJ made comments which caused employees to fear retaliation if they participated in complainant's EEO case, he experienced frustration, helplessness, humiliation, despair, anger, anguish, sleepless nights, obsessive thoughts, chronic fatigue, anxiety, and inability to participate in "life activities."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife indicated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he most pronounced effect that I observed can best be described as unrelenting stress and frustration. This was particularly evident after his coworkers, people from whom he hoped to gain information, were placed under threat of lawsuit and remained so while his complaint was being investigated. From then on he became obsessed with what was going on at the office. He was up and down all night and always tired. He used to read several books each week and work on household or recreational projects. For the next two years his primary activity was pacing and worrying. He essentially did not go anywhere or do anything constructive. His entire focus became presenting his case and getting someone in authority to address the lawsuit issue but that never happened. By the time of the hearing he was an emotional wreck. I advised him many times to call the employee assistance program or just see anyone who might help him deal with what had become an unhealthy obsession that was obviously making him ill. However, he is not that type of person based on his past experiences in the service and just internalized everything....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, a co-worker who testified at the hearing stated the following, on appeal:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I] was at the meeting in which the witness intimidation occurred and was the first one to notify Mr. Smith, about what happened. His reaction was predictable but he thought that if the right people were notified that the situation would be quickly resolved. He took the problem to [the Regional Chief Judge] and the various agency civil rights officials but no one would help. That is when this process began to take an observable toll on his mental state and appearance. While his investigation was going on he could not gain statements from others in the office because it would put them at risk of civil lawsuit. He simply could not believe that someone in higher authority would not tell the employees their rights and was extremely frustrated that no one in the agency cared. He was obviously under great stress and was always drawn and tired looking. I know he takes blood pressure medication and often observed his complexion to be quite red. Mr. Smith believes in wrong and right, and in this case wrong had control and I know that also affected his pride because he could do nothing to fight back.... All I can say is that during this period Mr. Smith was in great distress and was obviously experiencing a great deal of emotional anguish.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additional witnesses provided statements more generally to the effect that complainant endured a great deal of anguish due to the agency's actions. Although, complainant did not provide any evidence that he sought medical treatment for his symptoms, as noted above, complainant's wife has explained that it was complainant's character to internalize the situation, rather than seek help.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, we find that an award of $25,000.00 is appropriate to compensate complainant for his emotional pain and suffering resulting from the unlawful retaliation. We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,</span> 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Utt v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 072007001 (March 26, 2009) (awarding complainant $25,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant provided testimony that as a result of discrimination he suffered from stress, low self-esteem, difficulty sleeping, weight gain, curtailed recreational activities, and had to sell some of his possessions because of financial problems); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720080062 (February 26, 2009) (awarding complainant $25,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant endured emotional pain and suffering, humiliation, difficulty sleeping, weight gain, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $25,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Lampkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080017 (2009). The Commission found "that complainant and his wife presented evidence that as the result of the agency's discriminatory actions complainant became depressed, isolated himself from family and friends, suffered a relapse in his alcoholism, had uncontrolled anger, crying bouts, and that the symptoms of his diabetes worsened." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the Commission upheld an agency's award of $25,000 for the agency's reprisal against the complainant that caused a dramatic life change, including anxiety, depression, and anger. <span class="Italic">Lonny H. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120141222 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 by the administrative judge was reduced to $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720080019 (2010), where the award appeared to be based, in part, on claims of discrimination that were properly dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barrington v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101822 (2011), the Commission increased an award of $6,500 in damages by the administrative judge to $25,000 finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claims entitlement to a larger award of non-pecuniary damages. While Complainant has not established her entitlement to the requested $100,000 in light of the nature, severity, and duration of the harm she suffered, the AJ's $6,500 award is an exceedingly low amount. We find that Complainant is entitled to $25,000 in non-pecuniary damages. The record shows that, as a result of the discriminatory suspension and termination, Complainant suffered from stress, anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, and embarrassment. Since Complainant's disability was exacerbated by stress, she also experienced a great deal of physical pain and flare-ups of her condition. These emotional and physical consequences lasted for more than one year until Complainant was reinstated. The AJ and the Agency determined that Complainant should receive no more than $6,500 because of her failure to submit adequate medical evidence linking the discrimination and the alleged harm. While medical evidence is not necessary to sustain an award of non-pecuniary damages. Complainant has provided medical documentation. The record contains a note from Complainant's doctor stating that "the loss of her job severely affected her fibromyalgia" and that there were days when "she could not get out of bed and/or participate in everyday life functions." The record also contains two tenets from licensed clinical social workers that corroborate Complainant's statements that she suffered from anxiety, depression. inability to sleep, and loss of appetite.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In light of Complainant's own testimony and supporting documentation, we find that an award of $25,000 reflects the nature, severity, and duration of the harm Complainant suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $25,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120101138 (2011), where the discrimination and harassment resulted in the complainant gaining 40 pounds of fat, drinking more and withdrawing socially from family, and friends.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Myers v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110015 (2011), the Commission upheld an award of $25,000 by the administrative judge where complainant suffered mental distress, embarrassment and humiliation that manifested in physical ailments, and ultimately applied for and received disability retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $25,000 was considered appropriate by the Commission in <span class="Italic"><span id="Page_1856"></span>Cerge v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120100102 (2012), where a series of unwarranted fitness-for-duty examinations inflicted emotional distress but some of that stress was attributed to actions not found to be discriminatory:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to his claim for non-pecuniary damages, Complainant stated that he was humiliated, experienced stress, and angered by the Agency's requirement that he undergo multiple FFDEs without justification. He described loss of appetite, sleeplessness, fatigue, headaches, anxiety, frustration and desperation. Complainant's wife also asserted that her husband became distance, despondent, and depressed, with changes in his interpersonal behavior affecting the intimacy of their relationship. Complainant's brother-in-law attested that there were changes in Complainant's personality associated with his expressed feelings of ridicule, shame, withdrawal and loss of self-confidence. The record further reflects that Complainant's former co-worker stated that Complainant became withdrawn, fatigued and stressed. While an examination of these statements reveals that some of this described harm was associated with events where there has been no finding of discrimination, at least some of the harm is related to being required to submit to the multiple FFDEs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Muse v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110032 (2012), the Commission upheld an award of $25,000 in damages by the administrative judge based on the testimony of the complainant and a friend:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the record supports the AJ's award of $25,000 in non-pecuniary damages. We note that Complainant and the Friend provided testimony showing the nature and severity of the harm he experienced due to the Agency's decision to deny him the promotion. We note that the award is comparable to awards in prior Commission decisions. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30075 (August 7, 2003) (awarding $25,000 to Complainant in a non-selection case where Complainant indicated that he experienced depression, and anger for one year, stopped going out, cried, and had trouble sleeping, and the discrimination aggravated hypertension); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A21633 (August 7, 2003) (awarding $25,000 finding that Complainant experienced anguish, headaches, depression, stress, anxiety attacks, nausea, and sleep difficulties); <span class="Italic">Chaparro v. Social Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A03785 (August 26, 2002) (providing Complainant with $25,000 for abdominal pain, chest pain, headaches, trouble sleeping, anxiety, irritability, loss of enjoyment of life, and injury to reputation). As such, we affirm the AJ's award of $25,000 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 by the agency was increased to $25,000 by the Commission where the agency's failure to provide religious accommodation resulted in a period of 13 months of the complainant not being able to participate in Sunday worship. <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120103295 (2012). The complainant suffered a "great deal" of emotional distress as a result and also had to resign from leadership positions in her church. The Commission found that the discrimination did not cause the complainant's hypertension but did exacerbate it. She also presented evidence from her beautician that she had significant hair loss that affected her self-esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $75,000 by the administrative judge was deemed excessive and reduced to $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Barnette v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720120033 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has reviewed the entire record, including the statements made by Complainant at the time of the hearing in this matter regarding her humiliation, emotional distress, anger, helplessness, and apprehension of continued retaliatory action as long as she remains employed by the Agency. The Commission finds the AJ's award of $75,000 is excessive and that the Agency's request that the award be modified to $25,000 is reasonable and appropriate. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50033 (March 25, 2005) ($25,000 awarded for discriminatory non-selection where complainant, in his statement, detailed that he suffered from anxiety, irritability, mood swings, had problems sleeping, and had difficulty concentrating; finding that complainant had to endure embarrassment and humiliation for over two years); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30075 (August 7, 2003) ($25,000 awarded for discriminatory non-selection where complainant produced evidence that the discriminatory non-selection caused her to be withdrawn and depressed and was among the factors that contributed to her emotional distress); <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50001 (April 22, 2005) ($25,000 awarded for discriminatory non-selection where complainant experienced emotional harm and mental distress which impacted her personal and professional life; complainant's injuries were corroborated by a statement from her partner).</p>
<p class="noindent">A $25,000 award by the administrative judge was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0720120037 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant testified that she had to modify her family needs as a result of the Agency's actions. Complainant testified that her home is in South Dakota and she had to travel back and forth from her current position located in North Dakota. Complainant testified that she is a mother with five children and had to rearrange her family life drastically. Complainant testified that her reputation and character has been trashed throughout the Agency. Complainant testified that she suffered emotional stress as a result of the Agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also upheld a judge's award of $25,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720140009 (2015), explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[The administrative judge] awarded Complainant $25,000 in compensatory damages, based upon the several and continuous emotional and physical distress Complainant suffered over four years. Beginning in September 2007, Complainant became anxious. She could not sleep, experienced panic attacks accompanied by sweating and facial tics. Thereafter, she suffered insomnia, tremors, heart palpitations and headaches. The anxiety aggravated her claustrophobia, which prevented her from riding the elevator at work. This, in turn increased the pressure to be on time, adding to her stress. Complainant was prescribed medications. Her physician testified that even as of the date of the hearing, Complainant continued to have severe anxiety, panic disorder and major depression, due to the events at work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced an award by the administrative judge of $100,000 in damages to $25,000 where the judge determined $25,000 was the proper award, but then increased it because of the agency's conduct in the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The AJ found that an award of $25,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages would be consistent with other awards issued by the Commission in similar cases, but then awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages to "take into account the severity and duration of the harm done to complainant by the agency's repeated discriminatory conduct and lack of good faith effort in the EEO process" and the "aggravation of her anxiety and depression" caused by the Agency's discriminatory actions. We find that the AJ properly assessed the evidence introduced at the hearing in support of Complainant's request for non-pecuniary compensatory damages, and properly found that Complainant was entitled to an award of $25,000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find the AJ's determination that Complainant was instead entitled to an award of $100,000 in order to compensate her for the severity and duration of the harm caused by the Agency's "repeated discriminatory conduct and lack of good faith effort in the EEO process" to be a clear error of law. The AJ's increased award is punitive in nature. Punitive damages are not available against the federal government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(1); <span class="Italic">York v. Dep't. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930435 (Feb. 25, 1994). The Agency has already been subjected to two default judgments with regard to Complainant's complaints, in this complaint and in a previous complaint ([ ] III and [ ] V), and has been found in two previous cases determined on the merits to have discriminated against Complainant ([ ] I and [ ] II). Complainant was remedied appropriately in the previous complaints. The AJ cannot punish the Agency for its previous transgressions again by means of an increased award of compensatory damages in this case. Therefore, we find that the award of $25,000 is the appropriate award to remedy Complainant for the discrimination found in this complaint.</p>
