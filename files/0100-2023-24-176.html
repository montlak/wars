<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-151"><span class="space">b.</span> Working From Home</h5>
<p class="noindent">Understanding an employee's functional limitations presented by a disability is critical to the reasonable accommodation analysis. The Commission discussed this in <span class="Italic">Maxima R. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020004841 (2022), where the complainant requested telework as a reasonable accommodation for her multiple sclerosis. To support her request, the complainant submitted a letter from her physician that read, "although MS generally did not affect Complainant's ability to accomplish her work duties," he recommended that the complainant be allowed to telework five days per week "[d]ue to increased worsening signs and symptoms and severity of this patient's disease." The agency requested additional medical information from the complainant, including "what restrictions Complainant had with regard to her ability to perform the essential duties of her position, what restrictions she had with regard her ability to commute to work, how these restrictions or limitations were likely to change over time, whether telework was medically necessary, and how, in the provider's medical opinion, telework would treat or minimize Complainant's symptoms and assist her unperforming the essential functions of her position." The complainant responded noting only that another employee in the division was allowed to work from home. Emphasizing the importance of understanding an employee's functional limitations to establish the necessity of a given accommodation, the Commission found that the accommodations provided by the agency were sufficient in <span class="Italic">Maxima R</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency found that Complainant established that she was a qualified individual with a disability, so we will review whether the Agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. The Agency denied Complainant's request to telework and her request to work from an alternate Agency worksite. Complainant provided a January 31, 2018, letter from her doctor in support of her request for telework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the letter recommended that Complainant be allowed to telework five times per week, the doctor also stated that, "[i]n general, multiple sclerosis does not affect this patient's ability to accomplish her work duties as an intelligence research specialist, which demands mostly reading and writing." Because this medical documentation did not explain Complainant's functional limitations or accommodation requirements, we find that it was reasonable for the Agency to request additional medical documentation. The February 26, 2018, memorandum and letter to Complainant's doctor requested specific information about Complainant's ability to perform the essential duties of her position, her restrictions related to commuting to work and navigating the workplace, her prognosis, whether telework was medically necessary, and what other accommodations, if any, could assist Complainant in performing the essential functions of her position. Complainant clarified on appeal that, in response to the request for additional documentation, she resubmitted the January 31, 2018, letter on March 16, 2018, but this letter does not contain the requested information. The record also reflects that Complainant subsequently declined to provide additional medical documentation or further explain her limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that, based on the evidence in the record, the Agency did not deny Complainant a reasonable accommodation. The preponderance of the evidence in the record does not establish that telework or working from an alternate worksite was necessary for Complainant to perform the essential functions of her position, nor does it establish that these accommodations were medically necessary. Although on appeal Complainant challenges Assistant SAC2's June 24, 2018, email, on June 25, 2018, she responded to the email without correcting Assistant SAC2's summary of their conversation, including statements that mobility was not an issue for Complainant, that the distance to the restroom from her office was manageable, that she had no limitations with regard to driving, and that no other issues affected her ability to work at Headquarters. ROI at 225-28. While Complainant is entitled to an effective reasonable accommodation, she is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice. <span class="Italic">Lynette B. v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720140010 (Dec. 3, 2015). The Agency offered Complainant alternate accommodations consisting of a permanent handicapped parking space, a private office, the ability to take breaks as necessary throughout the day, a flexible schedule, and no restrictions on dress/footwear at work. The preponderance of the evidence in the record establishes that these accommodations were effective. We therefore agree that the Agency fulfilled its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency does not deny reasonable accommodation where the only effective accommodation is to work at home and an essential function of the position requires that at least some of the work be performed in the office. For example, in <span class="Italic">Petzer v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A50812 (2006), the complainant submitted medical evidence that he could only work from home four hours per day. The agency determined that it could only allow the complainant to work at home four days per week because an essential function of his position required him to access databases that were not accessible from a remote location. The Commission found no failure to accommodate, noting that the agency had also conducted a search for a reassignment position but was unable to locate a vacant position within the complainant's medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hollen v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120101510 (2010) (complainant's duties involved building and maintaining contacts with onsite contract employees); <span class="Italic">Cogdell v. General Services Administration</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a51681.txt">01A51681</a> (2006) (complainant's duties involved a high level of personal contacts both inside and outside the agency); <span class="Italic">Roth v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01A55898 (2006) (complainant with multiple chemical allergies could not perform essential functions from home where job required onsite presence to monitor Superfund site).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a violation of the Rehabilitation Act occurs when an agency fails to show that granting a complainant's reasonable accommodation request to work from home would have been an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Selma D. v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0720150015 (2016), involved a complainant with ADHD who requested to work from home as a reasonable accommodation. Initially, the agency provided temporary accommodations such as attempting to move the complainant to another cubicle, delayed arrival time, and occasional "as needed flexiplace," but, after a protracted "interactive process" involving three doctors, ultimately denied the complainant's telework request. The administrative judge found that the agency's failure to show how telework would have imposed an undue burden violated the Rehabilitation Act, and the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Selma D</span>., agreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630. In order to establish that the Agency denied Complainant a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must show that: (1) she is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) she is a qualified individual with a disability pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the Agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) ("Enforcement Guidance"). Under the Commission's regulations, an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(o) and (p).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that substantial record evidence supports the AJ's determination that Complainant was substantially limited in her ability to concentrate as a result of her ADHD condition. In addition, Complainant's other conditions (bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder) were known by the Agency and affected her ability to concentrate. Further, substantial record evidence shows that Complainant suffered from the side effects of multiple medications, which negatively affected her ability to concentrate. Accordingly, the Commission finds that substantial record evidence supports the AJ's finding that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In December 2007, Complainant requested to work from home, a private office, and a modified work schedule as reasonable accommodation. The Agency provided temporary accommodations including attempting to move Complainant to another cubicle, delayed arrival time (which S2 discontinued in September 2008), and occasional "as needed flexiplace." Subsequently, in October 2008, the Agency denied Complainant's reasonable accommodation request of regular telework, a private office or cubicle, and a modified work schedule after determining that it was unsupported. The AJ noted that Complainant testified that she was allowed to continue her modified work schedule in November 2008. The Agency, however, failed to present sufficient evidence that granting Complainant's request to regularly work from home and/or allowing Complainant to work from one of the empty offices Complainant testified were available would have been an undue hardship. Accordingly, the Commission finds that substantial record evidence supports the AJ's finding that the Agency failed to accommodate Complainant in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Waltraud R. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2020001535 (2021), the Commission found a violation of the Rehabilitation Act for failure to accommodate where the agency denied the complainant's request to telework two days a week. The complainant in that case suffered from "severe, persistent allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis." His doctor recommended that he work in a "well-ventilated, dehumidified environment in which to work, as a moldy or humid environment puts him at risk for an asthma exacerbation." Noting that complainant's doctor did not indicate the need for telework, the agency denied the complainant's request and instead allowed him to take breaks outside, leave work when necessary and take leave if he could not travel to work. The Commission did not like the agency's position that the complainant could simply leave work, when necessary, in <span class="Italic">Waltraud R</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not shown that the alternative accommodations it granted Complainant were effective. AAD stated that he offered Complainant an alternative accommodation of taking breaks outside and the ability to take leave when he was feeling ill. ROI at 130. However, Complainant stated that going outside for fresh air does not help and could trigger an asthma attack, and it would impede his ability to get his work done. ROI at 100. Complainant also stated that what was offered was not a reasonable accommodation because any employee is entitled to go outside for breaks and take leave, when necessary. ROI at 121. Further, "forcing an employee to take leave when another accommodation would permit an employee to continue working is not an effective accommodation." <span class="Italic">Denese G. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016); <span class="Italic">see also Elsa S. v. Nat'l Aeronautics and Space Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720180021 (Feb. 14, 2020); <span class="Italic">Jody L. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151351 (Jan. 17, 2018). We note that the Agency did not provide any evidence showing that taking breaks to go outside or taking leave would enable Complainant to perform the essential functions of his position, and we find that the Agency has not met its burden to show that the alternative accommodations were effective.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Agency did not argue that granting Complainant's request would have been an undue hardship. AAD only stated that Complainant's request was not reasonable because it did not lend itself to day-to-day operations of the unit. ROI at 132. Even assuming that AAD denied Complainant's request due to undue hardship, we find that AAD's generalized conclusion does not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship. Rather, a showing of undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. A determination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the effect on expenses and resources of the facility;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation to the employer; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See Julius C. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151295 (June 16, 2017); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation, Undue Hardship Issues</span>. Here, the record does not contain any supporting evidence that granting Complainant two days of telework per week would have been an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has recognized that an agency is not required to remove any of the essential functions of a position as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance Types of Reasonable Accommodations Related to Job Performance, General Principles</span>. <span class="Italic">See also Larraine S. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120180647 (Aug. 15, 2019); <span class="Italic">Carlton T. v. Dep't of the Navy, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151566 (Feb. 7, 2018); Timika O. v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0220140008 (Mar. 9, 2017). AAD stated that Complainant's position as a Program Analyst requires him to be available to assist others, and that Complainant requested training, and both required him to be in the office. ROI at 130-32. However, AAD did not explain why Complainant's physical presence in the office was necessary to assist others and obtain training. In addition, we note that Complainant stated that he had been previously approved to telework two days per week as a reasonable accommodation in 2014, through August 2017, and that it did not affect his work. ROI at 97, 121. We find that there is no evidence that Complainant was unable to perform his duties during the time when he was previously granted additional telework as a reasonable accommodation, or that providing Complainant with two telework days per week would remove any essential function from his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In opposition to Complainant's appeal, the Agency argued that Complainant's medical documentation did not support his request for additional telework. However, we note that the decisions issued by AAD on January 4, 2018, and March 20, 2018, did not inform Complainant that his telework requests were denied due to insufficient medical documentation. AAD only noted that the Agency may periodically request updated medical information, and that Complainant should inform AAD if his medical condition changes. ROI at 177, 54-55. In addition, when Complainant reached out to RAC for additional assistance, there is no evidence showing that RAC explained that Complainant's medical documentation was insufficient to support his telework request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Agency failed to continue to engage in the interactive process. Complainant continued to engage in the interactive process when he informed RAC that the granted accommodations of outside breaks and leave were not effective. While the record shows that RAC left the Agency on July 5, 2018, the last email from RAC to Complainant was sent on April 18, 2018. Complainant sent RAC a follow-up email on July 27, 2018, and even though RAC had left the Agency by then, Complainant's email shows that neither RAC, nor anyone else at the Agency, had communicated with him recently about his reasonable accommodation request. ROI at 315, 107.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission has recognized that an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process does not, in itself, constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Pitts v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120130039 (Mar. 13. 2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Doe v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>. Appeal No. 01A14791 (Feb. 21, 2003)). Liability depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the fact that the Agency failed to properly engage in the interactive process does not, by itself, demand a finding that Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation. Rather, to establish a denial of a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must establish that the failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant established that he was effectively accommodated from 2014 through 2017 with two days of telework, and that the Agency made him renew his request, which it then denied. As such, we find that the Agency could have accommodated Complainant again by granting him two telework days per week, but that it stopped engaging in the interactive process. As noted above, if the Agency required additional medical documentation to support Complainant's telework request, there is no evidence in the record that it communicated this need to Complainant. We find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant based on disability when on January 4, 2018, it denied his reasonable accommodation request for two days of telework per week and instead granted him accommodations that it has not shown to be effective. Accordingly, we REVERSE the Agency's final decision finding no discrimination and REMAND the complaint to the Agency for further action.</p>
