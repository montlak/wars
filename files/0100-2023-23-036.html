<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-37"><span class="space">9.</span> Transitory or Temporary and Minor Impairments</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Rehabilitation Act was not intended to cover minor, temporary disabilities such as a sprained ankle. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. USPS</span>, 01831462 (1985). However, the fact that a disability is transient in nature does not <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> mean that the employee cannot qualify as an individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See Spriggs v. USPS</span>, 01812202 (1982). Whether a temporary disability is covered by the Act has been a factual determination to be made in each case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(j)((1)(iv) ("The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment."). There is case law that specifically rejects the notion that the impairment must be permanent to qualify. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shields v. Credit One Bank N.A</span>., <a href="\\soppdyconfs01\Conversion_IV\EPUB\2023\09-LRP_HTML\10-EEO\05-Marked_Compared-Doc\32 F.4th 1218">32 F.4th 1218</a> (9th Cir. 2022); <span class="Italic">Lemuel D. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022002968 (2022); <span class="Italic">Carroll G. v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 0120182208 (2019). It is important to remember that the duration of a disability is just one consideration in the "substantially limited" analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lemuel D. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022002968 (2022) ("the duration of a condition is only one factor to determine if an individual is disabled, and the effects of an impairment lasting, or expected to last, fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the definition of disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix).").</p>
<p class="noindent">The impairment must have been regarded as a substantial limitation within the meaning of the regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gaines v. USPS</span>, 01871771 (1988). "Mild" or "moderate" impairments that interfered with a person's ability to perform a particular job, but did not limit significantly the ability to perform other jobs, did not meet the criteria. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">May v. USPS</span>, 01841631 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The only mention of "transitory and minor" impairments in the ADAA at 42 USC 12102(3)(B) appears under the "Regarded as having such an impairment" provision of the statute and must be read in conjunction with paragraph (1)(C). Together, they read:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Disability</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "disability" means, with respect to an individual--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;a record of such an impairment; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply <span id="Page_1125"></span>to impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less</p>
<p class="noindent">Two provisions of the ADAAA regulations, at 29 CFR 1630 discuss "transitory and minor" impairments. 29 CFR 1630.15(f), relates specifically to the "regarded as" theory and reads:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Claims based on transitory and minor impairments under the "regarded as" prong</span>. It may be a bit of twistdefense to a charge of discrimination by an individual claiming coverage under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability that could substantially expand the number of individualsthe impairment is (in the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment) "transitory and minor." To establish this defense, a covered by the ADA. In its ninth and final rule of construction at 29 CFR 1630entity must demonstrate that the impairment is both "transitory" and "minor." Whether the impairment at issue is or would be "transitory and minor" is to be determined objectively. A covered entity may not defeat "regarded as" coverage of an individual simply by demonstrating that it subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor; rather, the covered entity must demonstrate that the impairment is (in the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment) both transitory and minor. For purposes of this section, "transitory" is defined as lasting or expected to last six months or less.</p>
<p class="noindent">29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1)(ix), the regulation that defines "substantially limited" reads:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The six month "transitory" part of the "transitory and minor" exception to "regarded as" coverage in &#x00A7;. 1630.15(f) does not apply to the definition of "disability" under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the "actual disability" prong) or (g)(1)(ii) (the "record of" prong) of this section. The effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent">The writing of these statutes and regulations requires the reader to back into the answer which is that an actual disability need not last more than six months to qualify under the law. The "Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act" at 29 CFR Appendix to Part 1630, helps solidify:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) Effects of an Impairment Lasting Fewer Than Six Months Can Be Substantially Limiting</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) states: "The six-month 'transitory' part of the 'transitory and minor' exception to 'regarded as' coverage in &#x00A7; 1630.2(l) does not apply to the definition of 'disability' under &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(i) or &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(ii). The effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of this section."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The regulations include a clear statement that the definition of an impairment as transitory, that is, "lasting or expected to last for six months or less," only applies to the "regarded as" (third) prong of the definition of "disability" as part of the "transitory and minor" defense to "regarded as" coverage. It does not apply to the first or second prong of the definition of disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 3 ("[T]here is no need for the transitory and minor exception under the first two prongs because it is clear from the statute and the legislative history that a person can only bring a claim if the impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities or the individual has a record of an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, an impairment does not have to last for more than six months in order to be considered substantially limiting under the first or the second prong of the definition of disability. For example, as noted above, if an individual has a back impairment that results in a 20-pound lifting restriction that lasts for several months, he is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting, and therefore covered under the first prong of the definition of disability. At the same time, "[t]he duration of an impairment is one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Impairments that last only for a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe." Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 5.</p>
<p class="noindent">"Regarded as" or "perceived" disabilities are discussed below and the ADAAA provides that an individual may not be regarded as an individual with a disability on the basis of an actual or perceived impairment that has an actual or expected duration of less than six months. 42 USC 12102(3)(B). However, as set forth in the final regulation, the Commission does not view that six-month restriction on regarded as disabilities to apply to actual disabilities. An actual impairment that has a duration of less than six months can still rise to the level of a disability under the Commission's regulations if it is otherwise substantially limiting. Of course, the appendix explanation that accompanies this provision does little to further explain the minimum duration of an impairment in order for it to be considered substantially limiting. It merely states that duration is one factor to be considered and "[i]mpairments that last only for a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe." As evidenced by the discussion of case law below, that represents a significant departure from the Commission's previous position on the duration or expected duration of an impairment in determining if the impairment is a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shields v. Credit One Bank N.A</span>., <a href="\\soppdyconfs01\Conversion_IV\EPUB\2023\09-LRP_HTML\10-EEO\05-Marked_Compared-Doc\32 F.4th 1218">32 F.4th 1218</a>, 1224-25 (9th Cir. 2022), the court held that short-term impairments may be covered under the ADA if the effects are sufficiently severe. The plaintiff in that case held a job that required the ability to "'use hands to finger, handle, [and] feel,' to 'reach with hands and arms,' and, occasionally, to 'lift and/or move up to 2 pounds.'" After undergoing a bone biopsy, the plaintiff was unable to return to work for several months. "[H]er postsurgical injuries prevented her from, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, fully using her right arm, shoulder, and hand to lift, pull, push, type, write, tie her shoes, or us a hair dryer." After learning that the plaintiff would not be able to return to work until her next appointment, less than three months after her surgery, Credit One terminated her. The district court dismissed the complaint finding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the impairment was substantially limiting because she did not allege the symptoms were permanent or long-term. Tracking the same statutes and regulations, the Ninth Circuit disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, the new regulations contain a specific provision, and accompanying guidance, that expressly address the question of whether a temporary impairment can count as a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA. As amended in 2011, the EEOC regulation that defines the phrase "substantially limits" now contains a subsection stating that "[t]he effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) (emphasis omitted). By its plain terms, the regulation thus explicitly rejects the sort of categorical rule applied by the district court here, under which a "disability" would require a showing of "permanent or long-term effects."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This same regulation contains additional language that confirms how the EEOC's rejection of any such categorical "long-term effects" requirement follows from the post-ADAAA language of the ADA. As noted earlier, the ADA contains three alternative definitions of "disability"--i.e., (1) substantially limiting impairments, (2) a "record of such an impairment," and (3) "being regarded as having such an impairment"--and the ADAAA amended only the third of those three alternatives, which is contained in &#x00A7; 3(1)(C) of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> at 7-8, 10-11 &#x0026; n.3. Specifically, the ADAAA added, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the following limitation on this third "regarded as" alternative definition of disability: "Paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply to impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(3)(B) (emphasis omitted). The fact that Congress added such a "transitory and minor" limitation only to the "regarded as" alternative in &#x00A7; 3(1)(C) and not in the other two alternative definitions of "disability" strongly confirms that no such temporal limitation applies to those other two alternatives. <span class="Italic">See Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) ("[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.") (citation omitted). The EEOC's regulation recognizes this statutory distinction by expressly providing that the six-month "transitory and minor" limitation applies only to the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability and "does not apply to the definition of 'disability' under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the 'actual disability' prong) or(g)(1)(ii) (the 'record of' prong) of this section29." C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The explanatory guidance that accompanies &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) further confirms that the "effects of an impairment lasting fewer than six months can be substantially limiting." 29 C.F.R., Pt. 1630, App. (portion addressing &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix)) (capitalization omitted). The guidance explains that, although the "duration of an impairment" remains "one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity," there is no categorical rule excluding short-term impairments, which "may be covered if sufficiently severe." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). As the guidance explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]n impairment does not have to last for more than six months in order to be considered substantially limiting under the first or the second prong of the definition of disability. For example, as noted above, if an individual has a back impairment that results in a 20-pound lifting restriction that lasts for several months, he is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting, and therefore covered under the first prong of the definition of disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the ADA and its implementing EEOC regulations make clear that the actual-impairment prong of the definition of "disability" in &#x00A7; 3(1)(A) of the ADA is not subject to any categorical temporal limitation, the district court committed legal error in holding, based on the pre-ADAAA regulations, that a claim of such an actual "impairment" requires a showing of long-term effects. <span class="Italic">Cf. Summers v. Altarum Inst., Corp</span>., 740 F.3d 325, 331-32 (4th Cir. 2014) (upholding as reasonable under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984), the EEOC regulation's inclusion of "severe temporary impairments" within &#x00A7; 3(1)(A)'s definition of actual "disability").</p>
<p class="noindent">The only question remaining for the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Shields</span> was whether the plaintiff sufficiently plead that she had a "disability" as contemplated under 42 USC 12102(1)(A)--"[1] a physical or mental impairment [2] that substantially limits [3] one or more major life activities." The Ninth Circuit answered in the affirmative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the operative complaint pleads sufficient facts to establish an "impairment." The complaint alleges that Shields's bone biopsy surgery involved a 10-centimeter incision that "created a wi[n]dow into the bone measuring one centimeter in width by two centimeters in length for the purpose of harvesting tissue from [Shields's] shoulder and arm." The substantial injuries inherent in this intrusive surgery rendered Shields, according to the complaint, "unable to fully use her right shoulder, arm and hand" and unable to perform such tasks as "lifting, pushing and pulling things with her shoulder, arm and hand, typing on a computer keyboard or otherwise, handwrit[ing], or even [tying] her shoes or lift[ing] a hair dryer to dry her hair." Although it was anticipated that Shields would recover from these surgery-related injuries by June 20, 2018, the complaint alleges that Dr. Hillock concluded on June 18, 2018 that Shields was still unable to work. These allegations adequately allege that, due to her biopsy surgery, Shields had a physical "impairment," both in the ordinary sense of that term and in the sense described in the EEOC's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> Impairment, WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (1981 ed.) ("the state of being impaired: INJURY"); Impair, <span class="Italic">id.</span> ("to make worse: diminish in quantity, value, excellence, or strength: do harm to: DAMAGE, LESSEN"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h)(1) (defining a physical impairment to include "[a]ny physiological disorder or condition...affecting one or more body systems").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching a contrary conclusion, the district court drew a distinction between Shields's initial condition in the first eight weeks after her surgery and her condition "during the extension period." As to the latter, the court held, Shields needed to plead additional facts "explaining the cause for the extension" and setting forth more specifically "her limitations during the extension period." We disagree. As the district court implicitly recognized, the allegations concerning Shields's condition during the initial eight weeks are sufficiently "well-pleaded" to "give rise to a plausible inference" that she had an impairment, <span class="Italic">Ashcroft v. Iqbal</span>, 556 U.S. 662, 682, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), and we think the same is true when the complaint adds the further factual allegation that Shields's surgeon had concluded that her condition had not improved sufficiently by the end of those eight weeks to permit her to return to work. While it perhaps would have been a wise legal strategy for Shields to have supplied, in her amended complaint, the additional detail that the district court had requested, Iqbal did not require Shields to include more granular details about the exact nature of her then-existing limitations that caused the surgeon to conclude that her injuries had not sufficiently healed. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 678 (although the "pleading standard Rule 8 announces" requires more than "unadorned" conclusory assertions, it "does not require 'detailed factual allegations'") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the activities that Shields pleaded she was unable to perform qualify as "major life activities" under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A). The ADA expressly states that "major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A) (emphasis omitted). Here, the complaint specifically alleges that Shields's post-surgery injuries impeded her ability to lift, to perform basic grooming tasks necessary to care for herself, and to perform manual tasks such as pushing or pulling. The complaint further alleges that Shields was unable to perform some of the core physical tasks included in her job description, such as lifting, reaching, fingering, and handling, which indicates that her ability to "work" was implicated as well. <span class="Italic">Cf. Weaving v. City of Hillsboro</span>, 763 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating that, under post-ADAAA law, a claim that a plaintiff has a "substantial limitation on his [or her] ability to work" would require "showing that [the plaintiff] was limited in his [or her] ability to work compared to 'most people in the general population'" (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii)). These allegations amply describe "major life activities" as defined by the ADA</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the complaint adequately alleges that Shields's impairment "substantially limit[ed]" her ability to perform these major life activities. As amended by the ADAAA, the ADA expressly provides that the "determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures," such as medication, medical supplies, or other aids. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(E)(i) (emphasis omitted). The ADA further states that an impairment need only substantially limit one major life activity in order to give rise to a covered disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(C). The statute also provides that, as a general matter, the definition of "disability" is to be "construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals" under the ADA, "to the maximum extent permitted by the terms" of the Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(A). The definition of "substantially limits," in particular, is to "be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes" of the ADAAA, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 12102(4)(B), which include the admonition that "the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis," <span class="Italic">see</span> ADAAA, &#x00A7; 2(b)(5), 122 Stat. at 3554. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i) ("'Substantially limits' is not meant to be a demanding standard."). Taking these standards together with those we have set forth earlier, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> at 12-15, we conclude that Shields's complaint sufficiently pleads a substantial limitation on her ability to perform at least one major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have explained, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> at 14, the formal guidance accompanying the amended EEOC regulations specifically states that a temporary impairment that impedes the performance of a major life activity and that "lasts for several months" is "sufficiently severe" to qualify as "substantially limiting" within the meaning of the ADA and the EEOC regulations. 29 C.F.R., Pt. 1630, App. (portion addressing &#x00A7; 1630.2 (j)(1)(ix)). Thus, while Credit One is correct in noting that the guidelines confirm that the "duration of an impairment" remains "one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity," Shields's alleged impairment--which involved a substantial inability to perform certain major life tasks for more than two months--is clearly of sufficient duration and impact to qualify. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Nunies v. HIE Holdings, Inc</span>., 908 F.3d 428, 436 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that, under post-ADAAA amendments and regulations, plaintiff was substantially limited in the major life activities of "lifting and possibly working" when his "shoulder injury" impaired his ability to lift his arm "above chest height" without experiencing "stabbing pain and numbness" and precluded him from lifting more than 25 pounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Shields adequately alleged that, during the period of her requested extension, she suffered from a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA, we reverse the district court's dismissal of her operative complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lemuel D. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022002968 (2022) (emphasizing that "the duration of a condition is only one factor to determine if an individual is disabled and the effects of an impairment lasting, or expected to last, <span id="Page_1126"></span>fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the definition of disability."); <span class="Italic">Carroll G. v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 0120182208 (2019) (the Commission determined that the AJ erred when finding that "Complainant was not an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act because the medical documentation provided by Complainant did not establish that his work restrictions or his mobility impairment were permanent or were likely to become permanent and because 'Temporary impairments are not covered under the Rehabilitation Act'").</p>
