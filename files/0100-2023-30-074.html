<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-72"><span class="space">5.</span> Front Pay</h4>
<p class="noindent">Front pay may be awarded to a complainant in three circumstances: (1) where return of the employee to her previous position is not possible because there is no position available; (2) where return of the employee is not possible because of the hostility such a return would occasion; or, (3) where the employer has historically resisted the anti-discrimination statutes. Front pay is a traditional equitable remedy that was available in Title VII cases prior to passage of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. As discussed in more detail below, front pay is not an element of compensatory damages and may, in proper cases, be awarded in addition to compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Pollard v. E.I. duPont de Nemours &#x0026; Co.</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1946 (2001). Once ordered by the Commission, agencies cannot modify the front pay award or make a front pay award contingent on some other event. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joseph B. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120180746 (2018) ("the Agency stated that in order 'to be eligible for front pay, Complainant must resign from his position with the agency.' We find the parties are bound by the AJ's order, not that of the Agency. Consequently, the Agency erred in requiring Complainant to submit resignation documents before receiving payment.")</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">York v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01930435 (1994), explained the basic parameters of a front pay award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulations provide authority for an award of front pay under appropriate circumstances. Appendix A provides that if nondiscriminatory placement, such as reinstatement to a previously held position or a substantially similar position, is not possible, then the employer must make whole the discriminatee until such nondiscriminatory placement can be accomplished. In addition to awarding front pay when a position is not available, front pay has been awarded where a subsequent working relationship would be antagonistic or hostile or where the employer has a record of long term resistance to anti-discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Fitzgerald v. Sirloin Stockade, Inc.</span>, 624 F.2d 945 (10th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Kinsey v. Legg, Mason, Wood, Walker, Inc.</span>, 23 FEP Cases 770 (D.D.C. 1978); <span class="Italic">James v. Stockholm Valves and Fittings Co.</span>, 559 F.2d 310 (5th Cir. 1977) <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 434 U.S. 1034 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">York</span>, the Commission found the employee was not entitled to front pay because during the pendency of her complaint, she was approved for disability retirement. "[A]ppellant's inability to return to work cures the agency's liability for compensation because but for her health problems the agency could return appellant to work with assurances that she would not be subjected to an antagonistic or hostile work environment by the supervisor in light of his retirement from the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942985 (1997), the Commission expanded on the circumstances in which an award of front pay is available, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, reinstatement into an appropriate position is preferred to an award of front pay<span class="Italic">. Romeo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921636 (July 13, 1992). However, the Commission has identified three circumstances where front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement: (1) where no position is available; (2) where a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic; or (3) where the employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts<span class="Italic">. Keys v. Dept. of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870464 (May 6, 1988); <span class="Italic">York v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930435 (February 25, 1994). Further, the Commission has previously held that if placement in an appropriate position is not possible, the employer must find a way to make the victim of discrimination whole until such placement can be accomplished. 29 CFR Part 1613, Appendix A, Subsection 3; <span class="Italic">Tyler v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870340 (February 1, 1988).</p>

<p class="noindent">Reinstatement is preferred as a remedy over front pay. "The fact that front pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement implies that the complainant is able to work but cannot do so because of circumstances external to the complainant." <span class="Italic">Millard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991535 (2001). Where the complainant is able to work but is simply apprehensive about his return, front pay is not an appropriate remedy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Front pay and reinstatement cannot be ordered as that would place the complainant in a better position than he would have been in but for the discrimination. As the Commission explained <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720130027 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that to award both reinstatement and front pay would place Complainant in a better position than he would have been in the absence of discrimination. We find it is more appropriate to allow Complainant to take one of two options: either complete the remainder of his probationary period in a service representative position (under different managers, supervisors, and mentor) or receive front pay. As for the amount of front pay, we find that the AJ's initial award of two years to be proper in light of the two-year probationary term of Complainant's position and his ability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of front pay is "intended to 'bridge a time when the court concludes the plaintiff is reasonably likely to obtain other employment.'" <span class="Italic">Brown-Fleming v. Attorney General</span>, 0420080016 (2010). In that case, the Commission found that a front pay award of two years was appropriate for a former assistant U.S. attorney who could not be returned to her previous position in the office because of the severity of the racial discrimination that she suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ironically, front pay is not available in the precise situation where it may be most needed by the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Stoll v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944793 (1996), the Commission held that front pay is not a proper remedy when the evidence indicates that the complainant cannot work and may never work again. Because front pay is meant to compensate a complainant for future work that cannot be performed because it would be impossible to return the complainant to the work environment, it should not be used to compensate a complainant who cannot return to the previous work environment, or any other work environment. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Lau</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only issue before the Commission on appeal is whether appellant is entitled to front pay based on the testimony that appellant may never be able to work again because of the trauma she suffered as a result of the sexual harassment. The agency has offered no evidence to refute the experts' opinion that appellant may never be able to return to work. Instead, the agency argues that an award of front pay would provide appellant with a potential lifetime windfall, and strip her of any motivation to attempt to return to work. The agency also asserts that front pay "is not a remedy to which [appellant] is entitled under [F]ederal law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1767"></span>Contrary to the agency's assertion, the Commission has held that front pay is available in appropriate circumstances. Specifically, the Commission has stated that front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement, which is the preferred remedy, in three situations: (1) where no position is available; (2) where a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic or hostile; or (3) where the employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts<span class="Italic">. Keys v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870464 (May 6, 1988); <span class="Italic">Spicer v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930955 (June 29, 1994); <span class="Italic">York v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930435 (February 25, 1994). In addition, several circuit courts have held that front pay is appropriate where reinstatement is "impossible." <span class="Italic">Thorne v. City of El Segundo</span>, 802 F.2d 1131, 1137 (9th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Shore v. Federal Express Corp.</span>, 777 F.2d 1155, 1159 (6th Cir. 1985)<span class="Italic">. See also York</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930435 ("Appendix A [to Part 1613] provides that if nondiscriminatory placement...is not possible, then the employer must make whole the discriminates until such nondiscriminatory placement can be accomplished.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that front pay is not an appropriate remedy in this case. The Commission's interpretation of the availability of front pay implies that the complainant has the ability to work, but is unable to work because of circumstances external to the complainant<span class="Italic">. See Tyler v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870340 (February 1, 1988) (agency required to either create new position or pay front pay until nondiscriminatory placement achieved or appellant accepted higher paying position). As stated earlier, the Commission has stated that front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement in certain situations, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, no position is available, a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic or hostile, or the employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts. The very fact that front pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement implies that the complainant is able to work<span class="Italic">. See Cole v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940207 (May 11, 1995) (front pay denied where no evidence presented that reinstatement was impossible); <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921636 (July 13, 1992) (front pay not appropriate given turnover in management and preference for reinstatement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence overwhelmingly establishes that appellant can never return to work for the agency, and may never be able to work anywhere else. Two experts testified that appellant would probably never be able to work again. The agency did not present any contrary evidence. Because appellant is unable to work, the Commission cannot award front pay in lieu of reinstatement<span class="Italic">. See York v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930435 (February 25, 1994) (front pay unavailable because appellant was unable to return to work). Providing front pay in a situation such as this one, where appellant is unable to return to work, would amount to providing damages, a remedy in tort<span class="Italic">. See United States v. Burke</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1867 (1992) (Title VII does not redress tort-like personal injury). The Commission therefore finds that appellant is not entitled to an award of front pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Finlay, supra</span>, the Commission also held that an award of wage loss compensation under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act is not the exclusive remedy for illegal discrimination and that such compensation does not preclude an award of front pay. However, the employee in <span class="Italic">Finlay</span> was not eligible for an award of front pay because she was unable to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Holly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950220 (1997), the Commission denied an award of front pay where the complainant was unable to work due to medical conditions. "[A]n award of front pay also requires that the employee be available to work." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Augustine S. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720110018 (2015) (reversing administrative judge's front pay award where complainant unable to work); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 072006004 (2008) (reversing judge's award of front pay where the complainant was unable to work due to failure to accommodate).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an award of front pay is appropriate where the complainant can no longer work at her former location, but there is no evidence that she is generally unable to work. <span class="Italic">Brown-Fleming v. Attorney General</span>, 0420080016 (2010) (psychiatric evaluation that complainant could not return to the same workplace was not the equivalent of an evaluation that she was unable to work). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Carmina E. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720150011 (2018) (awarding front pay where the record showed that the complainant was able and had, in fact, been working, but she was prevented from returning to the agency by circumstances beyond her control, i.e., "[t]he still undisciplined harasser continued to work at the facility, indicating that a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic," and "the agency had not completed an investigation of the complainant's allegations for almost three years, which indicated a record of long-term resistance to antidiscrimination efforts.")</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of front pay is incompatible with an order to reinstate the complainant's employment. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720130027 (2015), the Commission found that awarding the complainant both reinstatement and front pay would place the complainant in a better position that he would have been in but for the discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that to award both reinstatement and front pay would place Complainant in a better position than he would have been in the absence of discrimination. We find it is more appropriate to allow Complainant to take one of two options: either complete the remainder of his probationary period in a service representative position (under different managers, supervisors, and mentor) or receive front pay. As for the amount of front pay, we find that the AJ's initial award of two years to be proper in light of the two-year probationary term of Complainant's position and his ability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Front pay is not an appropriate remedy where the employee applies for and receives disability retirement due to the agency's failure to make reasonable accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01961754 (1998), the Commission rejected the employee's argument that she should receive the difference between her salary and her disability retirement benefits until she reached the minimum retirement age. The Commission found the proper remedy was back pay, minus the disability retirement benefits received, plus reinstatement with reasonable accommodation. If the complainant elected to remain on disability retirement instead of returning to work, the Commission found that her right to back pay would be terminated as of the date she declined the agency's reinstatement offer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, when an agency's harassment of an employee totally disables her for employment, an award of front pay is not appropriate. "The very fact that front pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement implies that the complainant is able to work." <span class="Italic">Cook v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950027 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40037_r.txt">07A40037</a> (2004), the Commission awarded the complainant front pay where it found unabated hostilities between the complainant and management officials precluded his return to the workplace. Because of the front pay award, the Commission found that damages in EEO complaints the complainant had filed but had not yet been adjudicated would have to adjusted if he prevailed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, reinstatement into an appropriate position is preferred to an award of front pay. <span class="Italic">See Romeo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01921636 (July 13, 1992). However, the Commission has identified three circumstances where front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement: (1) where no position is available; (2) where a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic; or (3) where the employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts. <span class="Italic">See Keys v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05870464 (May 6, 1988); <span class="Italic">York v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01930435 (February 25, 1994);<span class="Italic"> McNabb v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33116 (April 19, 2004). The fact that front pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement implies that the complainant is able to work but cannot do so because of circumstances external to the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the front pay award, we find that the AJ applied the proper legal analysis in determining that complainant was entitled to front pay in this case. The AJ correctly determined that complainant satisfied prong 2 above, based on evidence of the agency's intent to effect his termination by various means, and the continued unabated hostilities between complainant and a wide array of management officials. We also find that the AJ properly relied on the economic model provided by complainant's expert witness to calculate the amount of this award, and properly limited this award to the 5-year period following the hearing, in which complainant would require medical treatment, as opposed to complainant's projected retirement date, because this is when complainant would most likely first be able to return to work at the agency. Additionally, as previously noted, we also find that the AJ properly considered post-May 2001 incidents in determining whether front pay was warranted, as distinct from the issue of liability in the other complaints. The AJ also properly noted that damage awards in complainant's subsequently filed EEO complaints would have to be adjusted in accordance with the front pay award in this case. Additionally, we find that the award of front pay is appropriate because complainant's employment as a Firefighter does not render him "unavailable for work," as would his physical inability to work due to disability. <span class="Italic">See McNabb, supra.</span> Also, although the agency has many facilities nationwide, we accord much deference to the AJ's assessment of the testimony of complainant's psychiatrist that his reinstatement at the agency would have a severe detrimental effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060019 (2008), the Commission upheld an award of two year's of front pay by the administrative judge where the agency failed to accommodate the complainant by providing a smoke-free truck. Although the agency argued that the complainant stated that he could return to work if accommodated and, thus, was not entitled to front pay in lieu of reinstatement. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, found that the complainant was entitled to front pay because management had ignored his repeated requests to enforce a smoking ban in his truck:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its appeal, the agency argues that reinstatement, not front pay, is the appropriate remedy, especially given the complainant's statement that he could return to work if accommodated. If front pay is awarded, the <span id="Page_1768"></span>agency contends, the record lacks evidence as to how long complainant should be paid. The agency maintains that in effect, the AJ awarded punitive damages in the form of front pay, since front pay was to extend two years from the date of implementation of the decision, as opposed to the date of judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Front pay is a form of equitable relief that compensates an individual when reinstatement is not possible in certain limited circumstances. The Commission has identified three circumstances where front pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement, i.e., (1) where no position is available; (2) where a subsequent working relationship between the parties would be antagonistic; or (3) where the employer has a record of long-term resistance to antidiscrimination efforts. <span class="Italic">See Tyler v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970340 (February 1, 1998). Awards of front pay imply that the complainant is able to work but cannot do so because of circumstances external to the complainant. <span class="Italic">See Goetze v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (August 22, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the above, we agree with the AJ's findings that front pay is the appropriate remedy in this case. The record reveals there is a history of an antagonistic relationship between the parties stemming from complainant's attempts to be accommodated and the agency's resistance to those efforts. In addition, we note that complainant worked in a vocational rehabilitation position, and therefore is available for work. Accordingly, we find that front pay is the appropriate remedy in this case. In its appeal, the agency argues that reinstatement is the preferred remedy. However, at the same time, it contends that it cannot accommodate complainant. Regardless of the inherently contradictory and inconsistent position the agency has taken regarding reinstatement, the record is more than sufficient to support the AJ 's award of front pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also awarded two years of front pay in <span class="Italic">Knott v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100049 (2011), where the complainant, a distribution operations manager with 30 years of service, was harassed to the point where he could not longer work. The case is also remarkable for the findings of the administrative judge, which the Commission quoted in its decision in <span class="Italic">Knott</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the AJ found that Complainant established by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency subjected him to unlawful harassment based on his race and in reprisal for his prior EEO activities on all seven claims. In his decision the AJ explicitly noted: "In all my years of being an administrative judge, which is quickly approaching 25 years, I have never seen such a cover-up, a conspiracy, and lack of credibility by agency officials as...in this matter.--The AJ summarized the case as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Everybody lied, did not follow agency procedures regarding Complainant's claims of harassment, did not follow Agency procedures about investigating accidents, did not file accurate and timely accident reports, supervisors inquired whether Complainant would be filing or completing his EEO complaint and when informed that he would, they issued a notice of removal the very, very same day. They violated Agency policy when lifting the proposed removal to a letter of warning and assigned Complainant to a different location for an alleged cooling-off period. They delayed [providing Complainant with an] investigation regarding the elevator incident. The Agency also requested duplicative medical information...and did not assist Complainant in obtaining sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As I stated at the hearing, almost every employee involved in the above was black. Not one person was disciplined, even though it was clearly obvious that major violations of agency policies were undertaken. One individual was disciplined. One individual suffered incredible harassment that the agency refused to investigate. Only one individual suffered an accident that went unreported. Only one individual was issued a notice of removal without even a scintilla of evidence that this was appropriate in light of Complainant's prior outstanding record over a period of thirty-five years, which did not include any disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In fact, only one witness, and that is the Complainant, do I find at all credible in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed above in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-30-025.html#sec21-26">Ready, Willing and Able to Work</a>," the Commission upheld the findings of the administrative judge that the complainant was entitled to back pay even though the harassment rendered him unable to work for a period of time. The Commission, however, terminated the period of back pay due to the complainant's failure to mitigate his damages by seeking alternative employment. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Knott</span>, also upheld the award of front pay by the judge, including a caveat that the complainant was required to seek alternative employment, but modified the period of the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have also already found that the record establishes that Complainant was able to seek employment with another employer as of August 2008. The Commission has held that front pay is an equitable remedy to be awarded for a reasonable future period required for the victim of discrimination to reestablish his rightful place in the job market. <span class="Italic">Deidra Brown-Fleming v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420080016 (October 28, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we affirm the AJ's award of front pay from the issuance of his decision to the time Complainant either finds comparable work or reaches full retirement age. The parties are disputing what retirement age should be used as the cut-off date for the front pay award. The Agency argues that Complainant, who falls under the Civil Service Retirement System, would have reached full retirement age in February 2009 because that was when he reached the age of 55 and had worked for the Agency for more than 30 years. Complainant takes the position that he would not have retired until he had 41 years, 11 months of service, which apparently would have provided him with the maximum retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that is making the front pay award, the AJ, in his decision, stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I hereby grant [Complainant] front pay with this caveat. [Complainant] is required to seek comparable work and the Agency is to pay hi front pay from the date of this decision until he finds comparable work or reaches full retirement age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a fair reading of this language, we find that the primary purpose of the AJ's front pay award was to allow Complainant time to reestablish his rightful place in the job market. However, the AJ also recognized the reality that Complainant, who had been employed for more than 30 years with the Agency, was near retirement age. In light of the fact that the primary purpose of the front pay award appears to be designed to allow Complainant time to look for a job, we cannot agree with Complainant's argument that he was entitled to front pay until he reaches his maximum retirement benefits, rather than his full retirement benefits. On the other hand, we also do not agree with the Agency that when the AJ issued his remedies' decision in July 2010, he intended the front pay period to end a year earlier, in July 2009, or he would have explicitly said so. Accordingly, in order to resolve this dispute, we determine that Complainant is entitled to two years of front pay, starting with the date the AJ issued his remedies' decision. In setting this time period, we find that it is a reasonable period for Complainant to accomplish the AJ's goal of Complainant obtaining other employment. <span class="Italic">See Brown-Fleming v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420080016 (October 28, 2010). In determining Complainant's front pay, the calculations should include Complainant's wages, Agency contributions to health benefits and life insurance premiums, and Agency contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System, and the Thrift Savings Plan. <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">In an ADEA case, one court has held that although there may be a presumption that an employee would retire at "normal" retirement age, that presumption can be overcome by the employee. In <span class="Italic">Curtis v. Electronics &#x0026; Space Corp.</span>, 113 F.3d 1498, 1503-04 (8th Cir. 1997), the court upheld a three-year front pay award in an age discrimination case where the employee presented evidence she would have continued to work beyond "normal" retirement age. The court in <span class="Italic">Curtis</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ESC challenges the district court's award of three years of front pay to Curtis. ESC disputes Curtis' testimony that she could have worked to age 70, and front pay should not have been awarded it says because her back pay award was approximately the value of three years pay and fully compensated her since she would have eventually lost her job in 1994 when further cuts were made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff carries the initial burden to provide proof of a basis for a front pay award, and the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove it is inappropriate<span class="Italic">. Barbour v. Merrill</span>, 48 F.3d 1270, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, 116 S. Ct. 805, and <span class="Italic">cert. dismissed</span>, 116 S. Ct. 1037 (1996); <span class="Italic">see Neufeld v. Searle Lab</span>., 884 F.2d 335,341 (8th Cir. 1989) (former employer must present evidence to rebut presumption that employee would work to normal retirement age); <span class="Italic">MacDissi v. Valmont Indus., Inc.</span>, 856 F.2d 1054, 1060 (8th Cir. 1988) (same). Determining front pay necessarily involves uncertainty, and the district court has discretion in determining an appropriate award; we review its decision for abuse of discretion<span class="Italic">. See Newhouse v. McCormick &#x0026; Co.</span>, 110 F.3d 635, 642 (8th Cir. 1997). Whether an employee would have been fired even without unlawful discrimination is a factual finding that is reviewed for clear error<span class="Italic">. See Nelson v. Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.</span>, 26 F.3d 796, 802 (8th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Neufeld</span>, 884 F.2d at 341.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There may be a presumption that an employee will retire at a "normal" retirement age, <span class="Italic">MacDissi</span>, 856 F.2d at 1060, but such a presumption does not control where there is evidence the employee would have worked beyond that age<span class="Italic">. See Doyne v. Union Elec. Co.</span>, 953 F.2d 447, 451 (8th Cir. 1992) (upholding factual finding that employee would retire at 70 rather than at age permitted under the retirement plan). Curtis testified at the post trial hearing that she was in good health and would have continued working at ESC until she turned 70, and she had testified at trial that she had been left with few resources when her husband died and that she continued to look for a new job after she was fired by ESC. This evidence is sufficient to support the finding that Curtis would not have retired before age 70<span class="Italic">. See Nelson</span>, 26 F.2d at 802 (evidence of employment search and no evidence of poor health sufficient to support a finding that plaintiff would have worked to the retirement date claimed). ESC did <span id="Page_1769"></span>not present any evidence that Curtis would have voluntarily left her job before age 70 had she not been terminated. On this record the district court's factual finding that she would have worked until age 70 was not clearly erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, in <span class="Italic">Peyton v. DiMario</span>, 287 F.3d 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2002), the court of appeals overturned the ruling of a district court judge that the plaintiff was entitled to 28 years of front pay consisting of the difference between her current job and former job. The court in <span class="Italic">Peyton</span> found that the judge's assumption that the plaintiff would have continued working at the Government Printing Office until retirement was too speculative. Explaining that the burden to demonstrate entitlement to front pay is on the plaintiff, the court in <span class="Italic">Peyton</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Barbour v. Merrill,</span> 48 F.3d 1270 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. dismissed,</span> 516 U.S. 1155, 116 S. Ct. 1037, 134 L. Ed.2d 113 (1996), we articulated factors to be considered in calculating front pay. Certain considerations "including whether an award of front pay would be 'unduly speculative,' may in some circumstances limit the court's discretion."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1280." The longer a proposed front pay period, the more speculative the damages become." <span class="Italic">McKnight v. GM,</span> 973 F.2d 1366, 1372 (7th Cir. 1992). Here the award of 26 years of front pay was unduly speculative and therefore an abuse of discretion. Contrary to the district court's understanding, <span class="Italic">Barbour</span> does not hold that a plaintiff's intention to remain at her employer until retirement, even if that intention is entirely reasonable, automatically entitles front pay for the remainder of her work life. Rather, <span class="Italic">Barbour</span> includes a list of non-exhaustive factors to consider, including age<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Barbour,</span> 48 F.3d at 1280. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Barbour</span> specifically suggests that the district court consider the length of time employees in similar positions stay at the defendant employer as well as at other employers, the time required to secure similar employment, and other factors<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Moreover, on remand, the district court in <span class="Italic">Barbour</span> only awarded one year of front pay, which was affirmed by this Court<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Barbour v. Merrill,</span> 132 F.3d 1480 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (Table). Neither the district court nor appellee cites any case which suggests that an employee's subjective intent to remain at a job until retirement, <span class="Italic">by itself,</span> justifies an award of front pay for the rest of her career.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While some speculation is necessary to determine front pay, here the appellee produced no expert testimony concerning her earning potential, nor did the district court examine what positions were available in the private sector comparable to a journeyman proofreader position at GPO. "The plaintiff bears the initial burden of providing the district court 'with the essential data necessary to calculate a reasonably certain front pay award.'" <span class="Italic">Barbour,</span> 48 F.3d at 1279 (quoting <span class="Italic">McKnight,</span> 973 F.2d at 1372). However, here the district court simply calculated the difference between pay at Bowne and GPO, and assumed that appellee would have stayed at Bowne for the rest of her career. In fact, Peyton had only been working at Bowne a little over a month when the trial began. Further, the district court took "judicial notice that Ms. Peyton can expect to receive regular and incremental increases in compensation as an employee of Bowne, Inc., as she would have as an employee of the GPO." But the evidence does not reflect how such increases would compare between the public and private sectors. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that salaries at Bowne represent a "fair sample of the market" or the industry standard in the private sector. Nor does evidence in the record support the finding that the GPO proofreading job provided Peyton an "optimum and unparalleled occasion to earn a handsome living." Appellee's assertion that the GPO position "was an unusually high paying job" is also without basis. Indeed, none of the citations to the Joint Appendix in her brief support appellee's claim that her witnesses "testified about the uncommonly high compensation for the GPO position." Finally, appellee does not substantiate her claim that she is not generally able to "pursue jobs in the future that will be essentially comparable to the job she lost." In sum, we cannot uphold the determination of front pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Gotthardt v. National RR Passenger Corp.,</span> 191 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 1999), does not alter our analysis. That case involved a 59 year-old employee approaching retirement who had been truly incapacitated by the employer's wrongful conduct and could not enter another career<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 1156. Given those circumstances, the Ninth Circuit upheld a front pay award that compensated future lost earnings through the mandatory retirement age of 70: "Although an eleven-year front pay award seems generous, the district court explicitly found that Gotthardt would be unable to work in the future, taking into account her age (59), her educational and vocational background, and, especially, her health."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1157. The <span class="Italic">Gotthardt</span> court noted that these were unique circumstances, because "front pay is intended to be temporary in nature."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Cassino v. Reichhold Chemicals, Inc</span>., 817 F.2d 1338, 1347 (9th Cir. 1987)). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Combustion Engineering, Inc</span>., 742 F.2d 916, 923 (6th Cir. 1984), the Sixth Circuit upheld an award of front pay to a 59 year-old plaintiff but noted that front pay for a 41 year-old plaintiff until retirement age might be unwarranted. Indeed, "[o]ther courts seem to agree that plaintiffs in their forties are too young for lifetime front pay awards." <span class="Italic">Stafford v. Electronic Data Systems Corp</span>., 749 F. Supp. 781, 789 (E.D. Mich. 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Bailey v. Container Corporation of America,</span> 660 F. Supp. 1048 (S.D. Ohio 1986); <span class="Italic">Foit v. Suburban Bancorp,</span> 549 F. Supp. 264, 267 (D. Md. 1982); <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Penn-Dixie Cement Corp</span>., 335 F. Supp. 231, 235 (N.D. Ga. 1971)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To award Peyton front pay based on the assumption that she will continue in an allegedly low-paying job (compared to a journeyman proofreader at GPO) for a full career, when she is only 34 years old and not incapacitated, is to give her a tremendous windfall rather than to make her whole. There is no reason to assume that if she is, in fact, qualified for a high-paying job at GPO, she will not be able to find a high-paying job in the future. Perhaps she will not. Perhaps private printers systemically pay less for the work she was training to do. However, the district court cannot make this determination solely on the basis of appellee's one month of experience at a private employer that may, or may not, be representative of the private sector, doing work that may, or may not, be comparable to the work of a journeyman proofreader at GPO. The record does not support such a speculative conclusion. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's award of &#x0024;377,615.72 in future lost earnings, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pollard v. E.I. duPont de Nemours &#x0026; Co.</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1946 (2001), the Supreme Court held that front pay awards are not subject to the &#x0024;300,000 cap on compensatory damages and may not be included in the computation of damages subject to the cap. In <span class="Italic">Pollard</span>, the plaintiff prevailed on a claim of sex discrimination against her employer. The district court awarded &#x0024;300,000 in compensatory damages, noting its belief that the award was insufficient but that it was bound by the Sixth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Reno</span>, 130 F.3d 1193 (6th Cir. 1997), holding that front pay was an element of compensatory damages. Writing for the Court in <span class="Italic">Pollard</span>, 121 S. Ct. at 1948-52, Justice Thomas explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented for review here is whether front pay constitutes an element of "compensatory damages" under 42 USC 1981a and thus is subject to the statutory damages cap imposed by that section. Although courts have defined "front pay" in numerous ways, front pay is simply money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement. For instance, when an appropriate position for the plaintiff is not immediately available without displacing an incumbent employee, courts have ordered reinstatement upon the opening of such a position and have ordered front pay to be paid until reinstatement occurs. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Walsdorf v.</span> <span class="Italic">Board of Comm'rs</span>, 857 F.2d 1047, 1053-1054 (CA5 1988)<span class="Italic">. King v.</span> <span class="Italic">Staley</span>, 849 F.2d 1143, 1145 (CA8 1988). In cases in which reinstatement is not viable because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the discrimination, courts have ordered front pay as a substitute for reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Gotthardt v.</span> <span class="Italic">National R.R. Passenger Corp.</span>, 191 F.3d 1148, 1156 (CA9 1999); <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v.</span> <span class="Italic">Sirloin Stockade, Inc.</span>, 624 F.2d 945, 957 (CA10 1980). For the purposes of this opinion, it is not necessary for us to explain when front pay is an appropriate remedy. The question before us is only whether front pay, if found to be appropriate, is an element of compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and thus subject to the Act's statutory cap on such damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the District Court observed that "the &#x0024;300,000.00 award is, in fact, insufficient to compensate plaintiff," 16 F. Supp.2d 913, 924, n.19 (WD Tenn. 1998), but it stated that it was bound by the Sixth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Hudson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Reno</span>, 130 F.3d 1193 (1997), which held that front pay was subject to the cap. On appeal, Pollard argued that <span class="Italic">Hudson</span> was wrongly decided because front pay is not an element of compensatory damages, but rather a replacement for the remedy of reinstatement in situations in which reinstatement would be inappropriate. She also argued that 1981a, by its very terms, explicitly excludes from the statutory cap remedies that traditionally were available under Title VII, which she argued included front pay. The Court of Appeals agreed with Pollard's arguments but considered itself bound by <span class="Italic">Hudson</span>. The Sixth Circuit declined to rehear the case <span class="Italic">en banc</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Sixth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Hudson</span> was one of the first appellate opinions to decide whether front pay is an element of compensatory damages subject to the statutory cap set forth in 1981a(b)(3). Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's resolution of this question, the other Courts of Appeals to address it have concluded that front pay is a remedy that is not subject to the limitations of 1981a(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Pals v.</span> <span class="Italic">Schepel Buick &#x0026; GMC Truck, Inc.</span>, 220 F.3d 495, 499-500 (CA7 2000); <span class="Italic">Kramer v.</span> <span class="Italic">Logan County School Dist. No. R-1</span>, 157 F.3d 620, 625-626 (CA8 1998); <span class="Italic">Gotthardt, supra</span>, at 1153-1154; <span class="Italic">Medlock v.</span> <span class="Italic">Ortho Biotech, Inc.</span>, 164 F. 3d 545, 556 (CA10 1999); <span class="Italic">EEOC v.</span> <span class="Italic">W&#x0026;O, Inc.</span>, 213 F. 3d 600, 61.9, n.10 (CA11 2000); <span class="Italic">Martini v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Nat. Mortgage Assn.</span>, 178 F. 3d 1336, 1348-1349 (CADC 1999). We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to resolve this conflict. 531 U.S. 1069 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiffs who allege employment discrimination on the basis of sex traditionally have been entitled to such remedies as injunctions, reinstatement, backpay, lost benefits, and attorney's fees under 706(g) <span id="Page_1770"></span>of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(1). In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress expanded the remedies available to these plaintiffs by permitting, for the first time, the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages. 42 USC 1981a(a)(1) ("[T]he complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"). The amount of compensatory damages awarded under 1981a for "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses," and the amount of punitive damages awarded under 1981a, however, may not exceed the statutory cap set forth in 1981a(b)(3). The statutory cap is based on the number of people employed by the respondent. In this case, the cap is &#x0024;300,000 because DuPont has more than 500 employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Sixth Circuit has concluded that front pay constitutes compensatory damages awarded for future pecuniary losses and thus is subject to the statutory cap of 1981a(b)(3). 213 F.3d, at, 945; <span class="Italic">Hudson, supra</span>, at 1203. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that front pay is not an element of compensatory damages within the meaning of 1981a, and, therefore, we hold that the statutory cap of 1981a(b)(3) is inapplicable to front pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as oriGINAlly enacted, when a court found that an employer had intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the court was authorized to "enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay." 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(1). This provision closely tracked the language of 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 454, 29 USC 160(c), which similarly authorized orders requiring employers to take appropriate, remedial "affirmative action." 160(c) (authorizing the National Labor Relations Board to issue an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter").<span class="Italic"> See also</span> <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 419, n.11 (1975). The meaning of this provision of the NLRA prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore, gives us guidance as to the proper meaning of the same language in 706(g) of Title VII. In applying 10(c) of the NLRA, the Board consistently had made awards of what it called "backpay" up to the date the employee was reinstated or returned to the position fie should have been in had the violation of the NLRA not occurred, even if such event occurred after judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Nathanson</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 344 U.S. 25, 29-30 (1952); <span class="Italic">NLRB v.</span> <span class="Italic">Reeves Broadcasting &#x0026; Development Corp.</span>, 336 F. 2d 590, 593-594 (CA4 1964); <span class="Italic">NLRB v.</span> <span class="Italic">Hill &#x0026; Hill Truck Line, Inc.</span>, 266 F. 2d 883, 887 (CA5 1959); <span class="Italic">Berger Polishing, Inc.</span>, 147 N.L.R.B. 21, 40 (1964); <span class="Italic">Lock Joint Pipe Co.</span>, 141 N.L.R.B. 943, 948 (1963). Consistent with the Board's interpretation of this provision of the NLRA, courts finding unlawful intentional discrimination in Title VII actions awarded this same type of backpay under 706(g). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Cidpepper v.</span> <span class="Italic">Reynolds Metals Co.</span>, 442 F. 2d 1078, 1080 (CA5 1971): <span class="Italic">United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Georgia Power Co.</span>, 3 FEP Cases 767, 790 (ND Ga. 1971). In the Title VII context, this form of "backpay" occurring after the date of judgment is known today as "front pay."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1972, Congress expanded 706(g) to specify that a court could, in addition to awarding those remedies previously listed in the provision, award "any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate." After this amendment to 706(g), courts endorsed a broad view of front pay. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Patterson v.</span> <span class="Italic">American Tobacco Co.</span>, 535 F.2d 257, 269 (CA4 1976) (stating that where reinstatement is not immediately feasible, backpay "should be supplemented by an award equal to the estimated present value of lost earnings that are reasonably likely to occur between the date of judgment and the time when the employee can assume his new position"); <span class="Italic">EEOC v.</span> <span class="Italic">Enterprise Assn. Steamfitters</span>, 542 F.2d 579, 590 (CA2 1976) (stating that backpay award would terminate on the date of actual remedying of discrimination): <span class="Italic">Bush</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Lone Star Steel Co.</span>, 373 F. Supp. 526, 538 (ED Tex. 1974) (ordering backpay from the date the employee would have been entitled to fill a vacancy but for racial discrimination to the date the employee would in all reasonable probability reach his rightful place). Courts recognized that reinstatement was not always a viable option, and that an award of front pay as a substitute for reinstatement, in such cases was a necessary part of the "make whole" relief mandated by Congress and by this Court in <span class="Italic">Albemarle</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Shore v. Federal Express Corp.</span>, 777 F.2d 1155, 1158-1159 (CA6 1985) ("Front pay is...simply compensation for the post-judgment effects of past discrimination." It is awarded "to effectuate fully the 'make whole' purposes of Title VII"); <span class="Italic">Brooks v.</span> <span class="Italic">Woodline Motor Freight, Inc.</span>, 852 F.2d 1061, 1066 (CA8 1988) (stating that front pay was appropriate given substantial animosity between parties where "the parties' relationship was not likely to improve, and the nature of the business required a high degree of mutual trust and confidence"); <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v.</span> <span class="Italic">Sirloin Stockade, Inc.</span>, 624 F.2d 945, 957 (CA10 1980) (upholding award of front pay where continuing hostility existed between the parties); <span class="Italic">Cassino v.</span> <span class="Italic">Reichhold Chems., Inc.</span>, 817 F.2d 1338, 1347 (CA9 1987) (same). By 1991, virtually all of the courts of appeals had recognized that "front pay" was a remedy authorized under 706(g). In fact, no court of appeals appears to have ever held to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1991, without amending 706(g), Congress further expanded the remedies available in cases of intentional employment discrimination to include compensatory and punitive damages.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 42 USC 1981a(a)(1). At that time, Rev. Stat. 1977, 42 USC 1981, permitted the recovery of unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional race and ethnic discrimination, but no similar remedy existed in cases of intentional sex, religious, or disability discrimination. Thus, 1981a brought all forms of intentional employment discrimination into alignment, at least with respect to the forms of relief available to successful plaintiffs. However, compensatory and punitive damages awarded under 1981a may not exceed the statutory limitations set forth in 1981a(b)(3), while such damages awarded under 1981 are not limited by statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the abstract, front pay could be considered compensation for "future pecuniary losses," in which case it would be subject to the statutory cap. 1981a(b)(3). The term "compensatory damages...for future pecuniary losses" is not defined in the statute, and, out of context, its ordinary meaning could include all payments for monetary losses after the date of judgment. However, we must not analyze one term of 1981a in isolation.<span class="Italic"> See Gade v.</span> <span class="Italic">National Solid Wastes Management Assn.</span>, 505 U.S. 88, 99 (1992) ("'[W]e must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law'"). When 1981a is read as a whole, the better interpretation is that front pay is not within the meaning of compensatory damages in 1981a(b)(3), and thus front pay is excluded from the statutory cap.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress determined that victims of employment discrimination were entitled to additional remedies. Congress expressly found that "additional remedies under Federal law are needed to deter unlawful harassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace," without giving any indication that it wished to curtail previously available remedies.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, 2. Congress therefore made clear through the plain language of the statute that the remedies newly authorized under 1981a were <span class="Italic">in addition to</span> the relief authorized by 706(g). Section 1981a(a)(1) provides that, in intentional discrimination cases brought under Title VII, "the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subjection (b) of [1981a], <span class="Italic">in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, from the respondent." (Emphasis added.) And 1981a(b)(2) states that "[c]ompensatory damages awarded under [1981a] shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, <span class="Italic">or any other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</span>" (Emphasis added.) According to these statutory provisions, if front pay was a type of relief authorized under 706(g), it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damages under 1981a.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the oriGINAl language of 706(g) authorizing backpay awards was modeled after the same language in the NLRA. This provision in the NLRA had been construed to allow awards of backpay up to the date of reinstatement, even if reinstatement occurred after judgment. Accordingly, backpay awards made for the period between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement, which today are called front pay awards under Title VII, were authorized under 706(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to front pay awards that are made in lieu of reinstatement, we construe 706(g) as authorizing these awards as well. We see no logical difference between front pay awards made when there eventually is reinstatement and those made when there is not. Moreover, to distinguish between the two cases would lead to the strange result that employees could receive front pay when reinstatement eventually is available but not when reinstatement is not an option--whether because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries that the discrimination has caused the plaintiff. Thus, the most egregious offenders could be subject to the least sanctions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had Congress drawn such a line in the statute and foreclosed front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement, we certainly would honor that line. But, as written, the text of the statute does not lend itself to such a distinction, and we will not create one. The statute authorizes courts to "order such affirmative action as may be appropriate." 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(1). We conclude that front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement fit within this statutory term.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because front pay is a remedy authorized under 706(g), Congress did not limit the availability of such awards in 1981a. Instead, Congress sought to expand the available remedies by permitting the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in addition to previously available remedies, such as front pay.</p>
