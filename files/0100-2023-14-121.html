<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-121"><span class="space">VIII.</span> RETIREMENT ISSUES</h2>
<p class="noindent">Retirement benefits sometimes factor heavily into settlement negotiations. Often, an agency that is unwilling to reinstate a complainant or is unwilling to award back pay will negotiate issues that impact a complainant's retirement benefits. For example, an agency that is unwilling to reinstate an employee with a mental condition who alleges disability discrimination may be willing to support an application for disability retirement. Or, an agency may be willing to expunge the record of an employee charged with a disciplinary offense and reinstate the employee contingent upon his retirement immediately upon reinstatement. In this manner, the employee can get service credit for the time between termination and reinstatement, which in turn will be factored into his or her retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some words of caution are in order for the employee considering a settlement agreement that purportedly affects retirement benefits. Retirement benefits are matters that are particularly within the expertise of the Office of Personnel Management. The Commission does not have expertise in retirement matters and must defer to the interpretations and judgments of OPM.</p>
<p class="noindent">No employee or employee's representative should labor under the false impression that an agency can grant the employee disability retirement in the context of a settlement agreement. The most the agency can do is promise to support the application. Disability retirement applications must be approved by OPM. Obviously, agency support is important, but it does not guarantee approval by OPM.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless the complainant can show bad faith on the part of the agency in agreeing to support an application for retirement benefits, the Commission will not set aside a settlement agreement where the retirement benefits are ultimately denied by OPM. In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994253 (2001), the agency agreed to provide the complainant with an appointment with a human resources associate in the compensation unit to assist with a disability retirement application. When her application was denied, the complainant alleged that the settlement agreement had been breached "because the agency knew that her application would not be approved at the time of the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission in <span class="Italic">Roberts</span> noted that the complainant provided no evidence to show that the agency negotiated in bad faith and therefore found that the agreement had not been breached.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies and complainants must also be careful when entering agreements that have a purported effect on retirement benefits. An agency and a complainant cannot enter into such an agreement unless the agreement specifically provides for a retroactive promotion or back pay award. The Commission found that the agency in <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01970988 (1997), acted properly by reinstating the complaint after OPM failed to approve part of a settlement agreement relating to the complainant's retirement benefits:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 16, 1995, appellant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement to resolve two formal EEO complaints filed by appellant. The agreement provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that appellant would receive retirement benefits at the GS-12 level. The agreement also indicated that actions subject to approval by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) would remain as such. The record indicates that OPM objected to the terms of the settlement agreement and refused to implement the retirement benefits provision of the settlement agreement. OPM determined that implementation of the agreement would constitute an improper, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, illegal, use of retirement funds because the agreement did not provide for appellant's promotion to the GS-12 level or an award of back pay. Accordingly, the agency notified appellant by decision dated October 9, 1996, that the settlement agreement could not be implemented, and therefore, it would reinstate his complaints for further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances, we find that the agency acted properly in reinstating appellant's complaints. Here, the agency did not have the authority to implement the terms agreed to in the settlement agreement. The authority to implement the retirement benefits provision resided in OPM. Indeed, the settlement agreement stated that, where applicable, OPM would have to approve the actions provided by the settlement agreement, and the record indicates that OPM determined that the agreement could not be implemented under laws governing the use of retirement funds. We note that there is no evidence that the agency acted in bad faith in entering into the settlement agreement, and it appears that the inclusion of the retirement benefits provision was merely a mistake. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the agency's decision finding that it cannot implement the terms of the settlement agreement of March 16, 1995, and notifying appellant that it would reinstate his underlying complaints.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Braziel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01995275 (2001), the Commission found that a settlement agreement that provided for the retroactive promotion and resignation of the employee was not intended to confer retirement benefits at a higher grade. The settlement agreement did not provide for back pay, but did include a lump sum payment. The complainant claimed a breach of the agreement when she discovered a letter in her retirement disability record advising OPM that the promotion was part of the official record only and that retirement benefits should be calculated based on the salary of her former grade level. The Commission found there was no breach of the plain language of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes settlement agreements can have subtle effects on an employee's retirement benefits. For example, in <span class="Italic">Earnhart v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890184 (1989), the terminated employee entered an agreement on January 3, 1985, providing that she would be placed into the first available opening after February 2, 1985. However, the date of December 31, 1983, was adopted for purposes of "agency-wide seniority." Subsequent to the settlement agreement, legislation creating the Federal Employees Retirement System ("FERS"), which is intended to ultimately replace the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS"), became effective. Under the FERS legislation, some employees remained under CSRS, some employees had the option of electing CSRS or FERS, and other employees were required to enroll under the FERS program. The employee opted to remain under the CSRS. The agency informed her she was not eligible for CSRS and had to be placed under FERS. The employee alleged breach of agreement. In trying to resolve the conflict in <span class="Italic">Earnhart</span>, the Commission opined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission claims no expertise in the interpretation of FERS provisions. However, after a review of such provisions (5 USC 8401, <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>.) and of various publications by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"), it is the Commission's understanding that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_434"></span>(a)&#x2003;Persons initially appointed to federal civilian service before January 1, 1984 are covered by CSR [Civil Service Retirement System] unless they choose to elect coverage under FERS.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Persons initially appointed after December 31, 1986 are covered by FERS and are not eligible for coverage under CSR.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;Persons initially appointed on or after January 1, 1984 but on or before December 31, 1986:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;may remain under CSR if they have five (5) or more years of creditable federal civilian service as of December 31, 1986,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;are automatically covered by FERS, and may not remain covered under CSR, if they have less than five (5) years of creditable service as of December 31, 1986 (certain credits are given under FERS for the service rendered under CSR for the period between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, other provisions govern persons who are rehired into federal civilian service on or before December 31, 1986:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Persons who return to federal civilian service within one (1) year of leaving such service and who were previously covered by CSR, are covered by CSR unless they choose to elect coverage under FERS.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Persons who return to federal civilian service after more than one (1) year and who were previously covered under CSR:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;may remain under CSR if they have at least five (5) years of creditable federal civilian employment as of December 31, 1986, or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;are automatically covered by FERS, and may not remain covered under CSR, if they have less than five (5) years of creditable federal civilian service as of December 31, 1986 (again, certain credits are given for the prior service performed under CSR).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, appellant could be entitled to coverage under CSR under several avenues. First, appellant could be entitled to coverage under CSR based on the fact that she was initially appointed on June 11, 1983. However, appellant makes no claim to coverage based on this fact. (Footnote omitted.) Second, regardless of her date of hire, appellant would be entitled to coverage under CSR if she had five (5) years of creditable federal civilian service as of December 31, 1986. Appellant makes no claim of eligibility for coverage under this avenue. Third, appellant could be covered by CSR if she was appointed on or before January 1, 1984. Relying on the fact that the settlement agreement states that her "agency-wide seniority date" is December 31, 1983, appellant rests her claim on this avenue of CSR coverage. Thus, the question is whether under the provisions of FERS appellant is deemed to have been appointed by the agency on December 31, 1986 (her "agency-wide seniority date") or on March 2, 1985 (the date she actually returned to service).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission noted that the intent of the parties in adopting the 1983 seniority date was to preserve the appellant's right to remain under CSRS. The Commission went on to note in <span class="Italic">Earnhart</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that nearly two (2) years would pass until FERS became effective and definitive guidance issued by OPM, the parties' hope and expectation that this goal could be accomplished was not unreasonable. Nonetheless, the application of the FERS provisions may render it impossible for appellant to be eligible for CSR coverage.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Commission claims no expertise in interpreting the provisions of FERS, but notes that it believes that appellant would have been eligible to remain covered under CSR, despite the fact that she did not actually return to service until March 2, 1985, had she either prevailed on her EEO complaint or had the settlement agreement provided for full relief, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, reinstatement as of August 27, 1983 (her termination date) and backpay and retroactive benefits. However, the Commission encourages voluntary settlement of EEO complaints and does not lightly set aside settlement agreements. "[A] settlement agreement made in good faith will not be [set aside] because it may appear that [a party] received less than his full share...or has made a bad bargain." 15A C.J.S. Compromise &#x0026; Settlement &#x00A7; 37. As no claim of bad faith on the part of agency officials can be creditably asserted, the settlement agreement will not be set aside even if it is presumed that a grant of full relief would have rendered appellant eligible for continued coverage under CSR. Here, appellant has been able to enjoy numerous benefits (including reinstatement and an earlier seniority date) as a result of the settlement agreement. It would not be equitable to allow appellant to continue enjoying such benefits while pursuing her original complaint. However, she has completed her probationary period and cannot be summarily removed from service merely because her EEO complaint has been reinstated. Thus, allowing reinstatement of her prior complaint would allow appellant to enjoy the benefits of the settlement agreement even if she should fail to prevail on her original complaint. Accordingly, if appellant is in fact statutorily ineligible for coverage under CSR, the Commission does not believe her ineligibility would constitute a breach of the settlement agreement by the agency which would warrant reinstatement of her prior complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the Commission's lack of expertise in the area, it ordered the agency to present the question of the appellant's retirement system coverage to OPM. The Commission further ordered the agency to "affirmatively request" that OPM permit conversion to CSRS and take all "reasonable actions" designed to secure that result.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Earnhart</span> case graphically demonstrates the importance of understanding all the nuances of settlement. If at all possible, questions regarding retirement status should be resolved prior to signing an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency and a complainant enter a settlement agreement that does have an effect on retirement benefits, both parties may be required to make a contribution to the retirement fund, regardless of whether the settlement agreement expressly requires such contributions. In <span class="Italic">Barry v. Postmaster General</span>, 04980034 (2000), the Commission considered the issue of whether the complainant was entitled to enhanced retirement benefits as part of the retroactive seniority granted in his settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon finding that the agency agreed to use the May 24, 1991 date for purposes of determining petitioner's seniority and eligibility for retirement, we now respond to the agency's argument that the retroactive seniority date provided for in the settlement agreement does not entitle complainant to enhanced retirement benefits. Initially, we find that the settlement agreement does not merely impact the retirement fund but it also imposes liability on the agency. Specifically, the agreement ordered the agency to hire petitioner with a retroactive seniority date of May 24, 1991, and therefore required the agency to use the retroactive seniority date to calculate petitioner's adjusted pay rate and adjusted annual and sick leave, in addition to his retirement eligibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that OPM regulations allow for retirement benefit credits to be granted as long as there is a deposit in the retirement fund for the period of service at issue. With regard to funding the enhanced retirement benefits, the Commission notes that the settlement agreement does not purport to impose the entire financial burden on the Retirement Fund. Instead, the Commission clarifies that the agency and petitioner must each pay their respective shares of full retirement deposits. The record reveals that by agreement dated March 20, 1998, petitioner has authorized OPM to deduct monies owed by him for necessary contributions to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) covering the period May 24, 1991 through November 28, 1992. We note, however, that the agency has not expressly agreed to fund its share of retirement contributions for this period. In finding that the agency agreed to use the seniority date for purposes of determining petitioner's retirement eligibility, we also find that the agency effectively agreed to pay its own share of increased contributions to the retirement fund. Therefore, pursuant to our authority in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c), we order the agency to take prompt corrective steps to implement the settlement agreement.</p>
