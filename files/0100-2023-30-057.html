<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-57"><span class="space">1.</span> Substantially Equivalent Positions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations require that, in the first instance, the employee be granted the position oriGINAlly sought or a "substantially equivalent" position, if justified by the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(b)-(c). In the past, the Commission was more lenient and often required relief in the form of a comparable position. The onus is now on the agency to demonstrate that some hardship would be imposed in granting the employee the oriGINAl position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="italic">Alvaro P. v. Secretary of the Air Force</span>, 2021004984 (2022), the Commission set forth the basic parameters related to relief for a discriminatory nonselection:</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">When discrimination is found, an agency must provide a complainant with a remedy that constitutes full, make-whole relief. <span class="italic">See Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co</span>., 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976), <span class="italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975), <span class="italic">Lazaro G. v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120170802 (May 17, 2019). In instances of discriminatory nonselection, "make-whole" relief includes offering the complainant the position they would have occupied but for the discrimination they experienced, or, if justified by the circumstances, a "substantially equivalent" position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(a); EEO-MD-110, Ch. 11 (Aug. 5, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A substantially equivalent position is one with compensation, promotional opportunities, job responsibilities, working conditions, and job status which are similar to the position discriminatorily lost. <span class="italic">Hernandez v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A60218 (Dec. 29, 2005); <span class="italic">see also Petitioner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420110006 (Jan. 31, 2014) ("the Commission recognizes that in some instances, such as the instant case, a person cannot be offered the oriGINAlly occupied position because it has been abolished for non-discriminatory reasons, or the functions of the position have been relocated or consolidated with other duties). Make-whole relief can include subsequent promotions that Complainant likely would have received if they had been selected for the position in the first instance. <span class="italic">See, e.g. Mehta v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Devel</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A32842 (Sep. 28, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The measure of "substantial equivalence" should be based on the position that was the subject of the oriGINAl complaint as it oriGINAlly existed. <span class="italic">See Hafiz v. Dep't. of Def</span>., EEOC Petition No. 049600021 (Jul. 11, 1997), <span class="italic">Monroig v. United States Commission on Civil Rights,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A20762 (Apr. 9, 2003), <span class="italic">Geraldine G. v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 0420170001 (May 4, 2017). The burden to prove substantial equivalency rests with the agency. <span class="italic">Shaw v. Dep't. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930370 (Jul. 15, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Day v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420012 (2002), the complainant claimed that the position he was placed in is not substantially equivalent to the position he was initially denied:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has consistently held that a substantially equivalent position is one that is similar in duties, responsibilities, and location (reasonable commuting distance) of the position which complainant oriGINAlly applied for<span class="Italic">. See Spicer v. Department of the Interior,</span> Petition No. 04980007 (September 24, 1998); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940079 (October 21, 1994). Accordingly, since the agency has failed to offer complainant the position of Information Clerk or a substantially equivalent position (i.e., which includes the commuting area of Charlotte, North Carolina), we find that the agency has failed to comply with our order in <span class="Italic">Wayne Day v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A10064 (March 7, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the burden is on the agency to establish that the position offered to complainant is in fact substantially equivalent to the position lost<span class="Italic">. Rai v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01901186 (May 17, 1990). In addition, we remind the agency of their obligations under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. which includes offering complainant a substantially equivalent position that he is qualified to perform with or without a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1751"></span>In addition, we remind the agency of its obligation to provide complainant with back pay up to the date that complainant either accepts or declines an offer of reinstatement as set forth in our Order dated March 7, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we observe that should the agency fail to promptly offer complainant the position of Information Clerk or a substantially equivalent position, the Commission is expressly authorized to issue a "show cause" notice to the Secretary of the agency, and can require the Secretary to appear in person before the Commission to explain the agency's continuing failure to comply. 29 C.F.R. 1614.503(e). In addition, continuing failure to comply with the Order of the Commission can also result in a case being certified to the Office of Special Counsel for enforcement action. 29 C.F.R. 1614.503(f); <span class="Italic">See</span> also, <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04980037 (August 5, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Breanne H. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0420180015 (2018), the Commission tackled what happens when a complainant works in a rapidly changing field like technology. Litigating a complaint can take years. Positions may be obsolete by the time remedies are awarded. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Breanne H</span>. where the Commission's focus was whether the offered position involved "similar, equivalent work" as compared to the complainant's previous position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner argues that the offered position was simply not adequate. In reviewing the position offered, we take administrative notice of the speed of developments in information-technology. Given the rapidity of technological transitions, it is therefore reasonable to presume that the express position Petitioner held in 2008 might simply no longer exist in precisely the same manner nine years later, in 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the last petition for enforcement that was issued on February 1, 2017, the Agency offered Petitioner the position of TranStats Manager Information Technology Specialist (System Analysis) GS-2210-15, Step 10 in the Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics ("BTS"), Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, Office of the Secretary in Washington, D.C. Following a series of clarification emails between Petitioner and the Associate Director, BTS management suggested that a position as the Sybase Database Administrator would be more fitting. Petitioner vehemently denied that this position would be equivalent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner described the position of Sybase Database Administrator as an administrative, low-autonomy, contractor-based position that was not equivalent to her former line of work. However, we note that in one of its clarification emails to Petitioner, Agency management explained that the E-filing system and IAIS, which Petitioner previously worked on, would be replaced by the Sybase system within 2017. Being offered the position of Sybase Database Administrator would therefore encompass similar, equivalent work. Aside from Petitioner's presumption that the Sybase Database Administrator would be diminutive to her skill level, there is no indication that the position lacked autonomy, or was not comparable to the prior position. The clarification emails sent by the Agency demonstrate that the position would have wielded a great deal of responsibility and autonomy over the management of the Sybase database.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In further support, Petitioner argued that the Office of Airline Information ("OAI") started a new project called the Airline Performance and Economical Information System Project ("APEIS Project"). Petitioner asserted that being offered an APEIS Project Manager position would have closely matched the E-Filing project that she was formerly on. She argued that despite offering this as a possible reinstatement position, the Agency simply ignored her. The Agency did not provide a reason for not offering and/or discussing this possibility with Petitioner. While that was undoubtedly frustrating for Petitioner, we note that the previous order was to provide Petitioner an equivalent position, not necessarily her desired position. Additionally, we note the steps BTS management made to modify the position after Petitioner first raised concerns that the initially offered TranStats Manager Information Technology Specialist was not equivalent. It was clear that BTS management was attempting to find and/or craft a position that would be equivalent, and suitable to Petitioner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner also argued that the new position did not offer her any role as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative ("COTR"). While Petitioner formerly served as a COTR, that would not have been a main function of her position as an Information Technology specialist. Even though the Sybase Database Administrator position did not include any COTR functions, this alone would not have made the position incomparable to her former position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Petitioner and her attorney have provided detailed arguments that the offered position was not comparable, we find that the position offered was equivalent considering the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">The substantially equivalent requirement includes considerations related to pay, benefits, status, taxes, health care, and more. A sole source contractor position, for example in <span class="Italic">Glenna O. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 2020001432 (2020), did not satisfy the Commission's order to place the complainant in an a substantially equivalent position to the one oriGINAlly offered to her with a staffing firm. The Commission noted the differences between the two positions in <span class="Italic">Glenna O</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency counsel argues that the only viable action it could legally take to comply with the Commission's order to continue its relationship with Petitioner was as a sole source contractor. <span class="Italic">See</span>, Reply Brief. She does not explain why. On January 29, 2020, Petitioner emailed Agency counsel that the Agency required Petitioner to create her own contract company, which is not what the Commission ordered, and asked the Agency to explain why it did not ask a staffing firm to hire her to serve the Agency (as ordered). The Agency still has not explained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its May 21, 2020 Compliance update, the Agency writes that it placed Petitioner in a LCSW position via a sole source contract in June 2019. It represents that it is in the process of exercising the option to extend Petitioner's contract when it expires in June 2020, and if she accepts, this will serve as the Agency's placement of her into a LCSW position that is substantially equivalent to the Mildenhall job at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner contends that her position as the only worker of a company she created with a sole source contract with the Agency is very different from serving the Agency as employee of a staffing firm. The issue here is whether Petitioner's position as a sole source contractor serving the Agency as a LCSW in Lakenheath is substantially equivalent to being employed by Staffing Firm 2 and its successors serving the Agency as a LCSW in Mildenhall.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains a brief email exchange between Staffing Firm 2 and Petitioner about its offer of employment showing that Petitioner would be paid an HOLA/COLA (Overseas Cost of Living Allowance/Housing Allowance) every two weeks on top of hourly based salary. H.E. C-1, Appx. 3C. There is little other information in the record on the terms of Petitioner's aborted prospective employment relationship with Staffing Firm 2. But there is enough to support Petitioner's contention that things are very different.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's sole source contract requires the "contractor" to maintain medical liability insurance, something she must now personally do, and she must take on administrative tasks such as complying with payroll and tax requirements as a corporation, invoicing the Agency, complying with procedures of the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), and so forth.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The individual identified as Coworker 1 in EEOC Appeal No. 0720180030, a witness for Petitioner, worked in the same Outreach Manager position as her reporting to the same Agency supervisor. Coworker 1 then took a new job with a staffing firm serving the Agency starting in June 2014, as an LCSW in Mildenhall's Preservation of Force and Families (POTFF), Special Operations Wing, the same organization Petitioner was slated to start serving the Agency as an LCSW in October 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 10, 2019, in an email to the Agency about remedies, Petitioner represented that Coworker 1 is still in the same position she was offered in Mildenhall, albeit with a successor staffing firm--KBR. <span class="Italic">See</span> Complaint file for Agency No. 9O0D2000452/EEOC Appeal No. 2020002998, Counselor's Report, at Attachment 7, p. 4. In her November 25, 2019 affidavit, Petitioner states that in his Mildenhall position, Coworker 1 receives three weeks of paid leave annually (does not say if this includes sick leave), stateside training required to maintain his social work license, is exempt from federal and state income taxes, and is required to serve 1880 hours annually, not 1920 hours. Petitioner does not submit documentation to support this. But we find it more likely than not that Petitioner's position serving the Agency as a sole source contractor is not substantially equivalent to the position she would have had serving the Agency as an employee of Staffing Firm 2 and its successor(s).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency is not in compliance with &#x00B6; 2 of the Commission's order. While Petitioner is free to leave her sole source contract position and start receiving front pay under &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2 &#x0026; 5 of the Commission's order, this will not relieve her of her continuing duty to exercise reasonable diligence to mitigate her damages, i.e., lost earnings. <span class="Italic">See</span>, EEOC Policy Guidance: A determination of the appropriateness of front pay was a remedy under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) (OLC Control No. EEOC-CVG-1989-1) (Oct. 25, 1988) (available at eeoc.gov); EEOC Management Directive 110 (EEO-MD-110), at 11-4 (revised Aug. 5, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency does not err when it reinstates an employee to a comparable position in the same office under a different supervisor where there is no evidence that a discriminatory attitude pervades the office. <span class="Italic">Trader v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01852871 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Questions about the appropriate relief can arise where the position at issue has been abolished during the pendency of the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Moulton v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01851082 (1987), the Commission found the employee was entitled to retroactive promotion to the same or a similar position even though the job was abolished instead of filled. The evidence showed that the position was offered to another candidate and was abolished only after that person declined the job offer. The Commission noted there was no evidence the position would have been abolished had the oriGINAl offer been accepted.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1752"></span>In <span class="Italic">Black v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520050180 (2006), the Commission put an interesting twist on the scenario of ordering relief when a particular position no longer exists by essentially requiring that the substantially equivalent position be "agreeable" to the complainant, but also placing "reasonable limitations" on the conditions demanded by the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Black</span>, there was no dispute that during the litigation all administrative positions in the district had been abolished and those employees were required to find other jobs in or outside the Postal Service. Under those conditions, there was no reliable way to determine what would have happened to the complainant. As a result, the administrative judge ordered the agency to place the complainant in an "agreeable" substantially equivalent position. The agency then issued a final action implementing the decision of the judge and the complainant appealed other issues in the case. Although both parties requested reconsideration, the Commission determined that the agency could not challenge the judge's ordering an "agreeable" position for the complainant because it had previously accepted that order. Still, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Black</span> did comment on the order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further found that the agency failed to comply with the AJ's order regarding placing complainant in a PS--6 Secretary, Operations Program Support position "agreeable to her." Specifically, the Commission, in its prior decision, stated that "we find that the AJ' s order not only requires the agency to place complainant in a position 'comparable' to the Position in terms of duties, but also requires that the position be 'agreeable' to complainant, in terms of its location. Here we find that complainant accepted the agency's offer of the New Position, but on the condition that she retain her seniority and retreat rights, and be paid mileage for the extra 300 miles added to her commute each week. The agency rejected her conditions. Therefore, we find that the offer of the New Position was not 'agreeable' to complainant. We also find that her concerns appear reasonable, i.e., to decline an offer because of loss of seniority and/or retreat rights, as well as the burden an expense of a long commute, could all be reasons not to find an offer "agreeable.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request, the agency asserts that the Commission' s initial decision with respect to the placement of complainant into the New Position was improper. The agency's request reiterates arguments that the agency previously raised. Specifically, the agency states that "the positions of all former Lancaster District EAS and clerk administrative employees were eliminated as a result of the consolidation. All former EAS administrative employees of the Lancaster District were required to find other positions, either within or outside of the Postal Service.... Had complainant been awarded the Position, it would have been eliminated effective October 1, 2003, when the Lancaster District was merged. She would have been reassigned, at that time, to the Lancaster Plant, as an unassigned regular clerk."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that "the Commission' s decision finding that the position be 'agreeable' to complainant contradicts the Commission's regulations and previous rulings that the position be a 'substantially equivalent' position." Moreover, the agency asserts that it reposted the notice of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fair reading of the agency's request for reconsideration reflects that the crux of its argument is that the Commission's use of the term "agreeable" in regard to placing complainant in a comparable position was improper. However, the Commission notes that the AJ in her decision also included the term "agreeable" in her remedies. Specifically, the Commission, in its prior decision, properly noted that "we find that the AJ's order not only requires the agency place complainant in a position 'comparable' to the Position in terms of duties, but also requires that the position be 'agreeable' to complainant, in terms of its location." The Commission notes that if the agency disagreed with the AJ' s remedies, it should have filed an appeal pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.110(a). However, the record reflects that by final action dated October 6, 2003, the agency stated that it would implement the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the position offered to the complainant was not substantially equivalent where that position was in Missouri and the position that the complainant had been denied was in North Carolina. In <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720060064 (2008), the Commission found there was no bad faith on the part of the agency where it presented evidence that the position that the complainant was oriGINAlly denied had been converted to a Title 32 dual status military position. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Carroll</span> also found that the position offered to the complainant was not substantially equivalent explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency offered petitioner an ATCS position in St. Joseph, Missouri, we find this is not substantially equivalent to the ATCS position in North Carolina denied the petitioner. Specifically, we note that the position in Missouri was not in a location close to the North Carolina position that petitioner applied for and for which he was not selected. Thus, we do not find the agency in compliance with our previous order. Therefore, the agency is required to award complainant a substantially equivalent position that is similar in duties, responsibilities, and location, that is, one which is within a reasonable commuting distance from the position that petitioner would have occupied. <span class="Italic">Bass v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04970001 (January 16, 1997) (<span class="Italic">citing Patterson,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940079).</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether a position is substantially similar, the Commission will look at the career promotion potential of the position the complainant was denied and the one he was offered by the agency. <span class="Italic">Carver v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902442 (1990). The positions must be substantially similar with respect to promotion potential.</p>
<p class="noindent">Compensation is not the only factor in considering whether a position is substantially similar. In <span class="Italic">Kinnear v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 05A30086 (2003), the Commission found the fact that the job offered to the complainant paid more than the job it ordered as relief did not show the positions were substantially equivalent.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Sheth v. Secretary of Army</span>, 04A100011 (2001), the Commission ordered that the petitioner was entitled to be placed into the position of GS-830-12 Supervisory Mechanical Engineer. The agency instead reassigned the petitioner into the position of GS-12 Supervisory Environmental Engineer. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sheth</span> found that these positions were not substantially similar and ordered the agency to place the petitioner into such a position, or, if none was available, into the oriGINAl position for which he was discriminatorily not selected:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as this position is not in the management job series with accompanying future promotion potential and does not include the ability to supervise subordinate personnel, the Commission finds that the position to which petitioner was reassigned, that of "Supervisory Environmental Engineer," is not substantially equivalent to the GS-12 "Supervisory Mechanical Engineer" position for which petitioner was discriminatorily not selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we further find that petitioner is entitled to be placed into a GS-12 "Supervisory Mechanical Engineer" position with attendant supervisory responsibilities. If none is currently vacant, then petitioner is entitled to be placed in the oriGINAl position for which he was not selected, even if it means removing one of the oriGINAl STs who was chosen oriGINAlly. The Commission has previously taken judicial notice that "bumping" of an incumbent is a permissible remedy when in the absence of such bumping, the complainant's relief would be unjustly inadequate<span class="Italic">. Harness v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01920294 (June 16, 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Lander v. Lujan</span>, 88 F.2d 155 (D.C. Cir. 1989)). The Commission also agrees with petitioner that the agency should award him additional attorney's fees for efforts to enforce the Commission's order that petitioner be placed in the GS-830-12 Supervisory Mechanical Engineer position with supervisory responsibilities, or equivalent position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bergmann v. Attorney General</span>, 04A20001 (2003), the Commission found that a substantially equivalent position required that the agency promote the complainant from the GS-11 level to the GS-12 level, effective a little over one year from the date of her retroactive appointment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bergmann</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A substantially equivalent position is one with compensation, promotional opportunities, job responsibilities, working conditions, and job status which are similar to the position discriminatorily lost<span class="Italic">. See Myers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04950028 (May 2, 1996); <span class="Italic">Kerschner v. Dep't of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933023 (March 15, 1994). Petitioner's initial appointment on December 30, 1990 was to a GS-11 Clinical Psychologist position. However, the record suggests that petitioner would have received a promotion to the GS-12 level following successful completion of her one year probationary period. The record contains a GS-13 Clinical Psychologist position description, a personnel action for the abolishment of the GS-13 Clinical Psychologist position and the establishment of the GS-12 Clinical Psychologist position, an agency organizational chart which lists two GS-12 Psychologist positions under a Chief Psychologist, and a request by the Chief Psychologist for the promotion of petitioner's Psychologist coworker to the GS-12 level after the completion of one year of service. In addition, we note that the agency awarded petitioner step increases on the GS-11 level in implementing the Order of EEOC Request No. 05960429. Accordingly, we find that petitioner is entitled to a retroactive promotion to the GS-12 level effective one year and thirteen weeks following the effective date of her hire appointment, appropriate subsequent step increases on the GS-12 level, as well as the calculation and payment of back-pay, annual leave and other applicable benefits on the appropriate grade and step levels.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining if a position is substantially equivalent, the Commission will examine the nature of the duties of the position offered and the position denied though discrimination, the level of those duties and the organizational structure of the agency. In <span class="Italic">Khatami v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/04a50013.txt">04A50013</a> (2005), the Commission went through a detailed review of the two positions prior to concluding the offered position was not substantially similar:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the position description for the Technology Specialist position reveals that the position is within the Technology Transfer Branch, an office whose primary function is described as implementing the Federal Technology Transfer Act, specifically implementing legislation relating <span id="Page_1753"></span>to collaborative agreements, inventions, patents, and royalties.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Agency Reply to Petitioner's Enforcement Petition, Tab 5. The duties of the incumbent are predominantly related to Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), and the incumbent oriGINAtes and drafts complex CRADAs and similar agreements, represents the agency in negotiating CRADAs and similar agreements with other parties, and manages and monitors the process for handling CRADAs and similar agreements, as well as potential inventions involving all interested parties. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The incumbent further plays an educational role concerning technology transfer issues such as inventions, patents, licensing, confidential information, copyrights, trademarks, and collaborative agreements, and an advisory role concerning domestic and foreign patent rights, policies, and procedures. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The position description further states that the incumbent is required to possess a "mastery of the administrative laws, policies, rules, methods and procedures of [the agency] as they relate to technology transfer,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, and that this includes "expert knowledge of the laws and procedures relating to patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as grants and contract law and procedures,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, including certain specific laws and Acts applicable to the position, a wide range of domestic administrative laws and regulations, court decisions, and international law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the position description for the Assistant Director position reveals that the position is within the Office of Technology and Industrial Relations, an office whose primary function is creating a '"user friendly' interface for interactions of the extramural program with industry, addressing cross-cutting issues related to technology development in the extramural programs, and managing cross-cutting technology initiatives," Agency Hearing Exhibit 21 for Appeal No. 07A30127, p. 5, as well as "coordinat[ing] existing information from extramural programs on mechanisms for interaction with industry, identify[ing] unmet information needs of industry, develop[ing] mechanisms for dissemination of information to industry, and coordinating] with extramural programs and the Technology Development and Commercialization Branch on building liaisons with industry."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The incumbent is described as serving as "an expert on the implementation of technology development programs within the National Cancer Program,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, and as "a resource for technology [sic] development needs of the cancer and clinical oncology research communities and opportunities for the support of technology development." The position description addresses numerous other ways in which the position primarily addresses identifying, supporting, and developing technology development programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record thus reveals that the Technology Specialist position consists in large part of negotiating, drafting, and administering agreements, in an office whose function is the implementing of legislation relating to such agreements. The Assistant Director position, on the other hand, consists in large part of implementing and developing technology development programs in an office whose function is industrial relations. In addition, the knowledge required for the Technology Specialist position is highly specific technical legal knowledge, none of which is revealed in petitioner's curriculum vitae. Deposition for EEOC Appeal No. 07A30127, Exhibit 8, also identified as Exhibit 5. The knowledge required for the Assistant Director position, on the other hand, is far broader, consisting of generalized knowledge of the National Cancer Institute's overall research programs and activities. Such knowledge is more consistent with petitioner's experience as a Health Science Administrator at the National Cancer Program, a position described by petitioner's former supervisor as involving "a translation of biology and biochemistry science into an early detection (of cancer) research program." Affidavit before Agency Investigator, Report of Investigation for EEOC Appeal No. 07A40072, Tab 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the positions are comparable in that "each requires the incumbent to play an active role in promoting scientific technological interchange by working closely with industrial, academic, and federal scientists. Both positions also provide advice to the NCI researchers and researchers of cooperating institutions on matters related to the support of technology development. Both serve as a point for information on NCI-wide opportunities for the support of technology development. Neither position requires the possession of a law degree...both positions require technology work, which is work that can be performed by individuals who are scientists and/or scientist administrators with a Ph.D. or by individuals who possess equivalent research experience or other scientific discipline related to the mission of the NCI." Agency letter, January 26, 2005, attachment p. 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While there are undoubtedly some similarities between the positions, we note that these are no more than may be expected of professional positions within a scientific organization. However, while a law degree may not be necessary for the Technology Specialist position, the position undoubtedly requires a high degree of specialized legal knowledge of the type that is simply not required by the Assistant Director position. Furthermore, as the Assistant Director position involves the implementation and development of technology development programs we find it is more of a policy formulation position than is the Technology Specialist position. Finally, we find that the way the Assistant Director "work[s] closely with industrial, academic, and federal scientists" in the context of industrial relations is fundamentally different from the way the Technology Specialist may be said to be "working with" such scientists when negotiating agreements. For all of the above reasons we find that the agency has not met its burden of showing that the Technology Specialist position is comparable to the Assistant Director position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that petitioner is entitled to a position with promotion potential to GS-15, just like the oriGINAl position denied her. However, regarding petitioner's argument that she should be offered a GS-15 position, we find that complainant has not met her burden of establishing that she would have been promoted to a GS-15 after a year, or even by the time of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency demonstrates that a position is substantially similar, even though the hours are different, where it creates a new position for the complainant in order to retain the services of both the selectee and the complainant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11309 (2002). In that case, "the agency made a business decision to schedule complainant's tour to cover additional hours of agency operations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The substantially equivalent position must be in the same location as the position that the complainant was denied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kinnear v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 07A10104 (2002). See also "<span class="blue">Displacement of Beneficiaries of Discrimination</span>," above.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the employee accepts a position as substantially equivalent that constitutes compliance with any order for relief. <span class="Italic">Tuala v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A44230 (2006).</p>
