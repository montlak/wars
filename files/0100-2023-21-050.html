<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-46"><span class="space">17.</span> Psychological Harm</h4>
<p class="noindent">Squaring the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> with pre-<span class="Italic">Harris</span> case law is not easy. <span class="Italic">Harris</span> eliminated any requirement that the harassment be psychologically injurious, but at the same time kept the requirement that the harassment be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the work conditions. On the one hand, an alleged victim of sexual harassment does not have to show that he or she was driven to a nervous breakdown. On the other hand, an alleged victim must show something more than mere annoyance or dislike of the offending behavior. The difficult question becomes just when, between these two extremes, a work environment becomes legally actionable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some courts still seem to interpret the severe or pervasive requirement of sexual harassment claims to require something more than envisioned by <span class="Italic">Harris</span> in applying its objective prong. In <span class="Italic">Vigil v. City of Las Cruces</span>, 119 F.3d 871 (10th Cir. 1997), Judge Lucero, dissenting from a denial of petition for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, accused the court of applying language from pre-<span class="Italic">Harris</span> cases in such a way as to reimpose the psychological injury requirement rejected by the Supreme Court. The case also is notable because the original opinion was a nonprecedential opinion. (Previously such opinions were also unpublished, but now legal publishers routinely print all decisions.) Judge Porfilio, writing to defend his vote to deny rehearing, indicated he had "no idea what to label this missive." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 871. He further lamented that there already was "enough judicial verbiage in print to confound practitioners" and noted that he found "opprobrious this whole notion of publishing non-precedential matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At the risk of further confounding practitioners, however, Judge Lucero's dissent from <span class="Italic">Vigil</span>, 119 F.3d at 871-76, follows because it points out one of the basic dilemmas in sexual harassment cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an unpublished order, a panel of this court recently decided that a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> plaintiff's allegations of racial and sexual harassment are insufficient to resist summary judgment under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Vigil v. City of Las Cruces</span>, No. 96-2059, 1997 WL 265095 (10th Cir. May 20, 1997). Mary Ann Vigil claims that when working as a department clerk typist at the Las Cruces International Airport, her supervisor "frequently" referred to Hispanics as "wetbacks," and, in response to complaints that Hispanic customers were overcharged, stated, "I didn't know that Mexicans had rights." She further claims that this same supervisor offered her pornographic software, left pornographic photographs in her desk, and "constantly" requested that she accompany him flying despite her repeated statements that she was not interested in doing so. Assuming the truth of these contentions, Ms. Vigil has presented an adequate case of a racially and sexually hostile work environment, as defined by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 66 (1986), and <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In ruling against Ms. Vigil's racial harassment claim, the panel relies on <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co</span>., 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987), which states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is well established that a working environment dominated by racial slurs constitutes a violation of Title VII. To establish a racially hostile work environment, however, plaintiffs must prove more than a few isolated incidents of racial enmity. Casual comments, or accidental or sporadic conversation, will not trigger equitable relief pursuant to the statute. Instead, there must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comment. Title VII is violated only where the work environment is so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy the emotional and psychological stability of the minority employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1412-13 (internal quotations and citations omitted). In light of <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the panel errs in relying on <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>. I have therefore requested the court to reconsider <span class="Italic">en banc</span> the current status of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> in Title VII hostile work environment cases and the application of a corrected standard to Ms. Vigil's racial and sexual harassment claims. From the court's decision not to rehear the case <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, the Supreme Court held that Title VII is violated where <span id="Page_846"></span>harassment is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive working environment." 477 U.S. at 67 (quotation omitted) (alteration in original). Subsequently, the Court stressed that this standard does not require a plaintiff to show that the conduct complained of caused "tangible psychological injury." <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 21. The <span class="Italic">Harris</span> Court was careful to note that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[t]he appalling conduct alleged in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, and the reference in that case to environments "so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers," merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22 (quoting <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 66) (further quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Thus our claim in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> that "Title VII is violated only where the work environment is so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy the emotional and psychological stability of the minority employee," 833 F.2d at 1412-13 (quotation omitted), cannot stand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although Tenth Circuit cases subsequent to <span class="Italic">Harris</span> have repeated the requirement of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> that "there must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comment," <span class="Italic">id</span>., for a Title VII claim to lie, <span class="Italic">see, e.g, Bolden v. PRC Inc.,</span> 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 116 S. Ct. 92 (1995), <span class="Italic">Harris</span> must at a minimum color our interpretation of what constitutes a "barrage." A "barrage" cannot, consistent with <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, be found to exist only in cases where the psychological well-being of a Title VII plaintiff is tangibly affected. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 22 ("So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious."). If we are to require a "barrage" at all, then we must purge the term of its historically-entrenched overtones of psychological injury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But we should go further and dispense with the requirement of a "steady barrage" altogether. The Supreme Court has made clear that racial or sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII whenever the conduct at issue is "severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive." <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 21 (emphasis added). If sufficiently severe, harassment is actionable under Title VII--regardless of its pervasiveness or frequency. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 23 (determination of objective hostility is made "by looking at all the circumstances," including "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct [and] its severity," but "no single factor is required.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In line with <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, other circuits have recognized that Title VII hostile work environment plaintiffs need not prove a pattern, "steady barrage," or other minimum quantum of discriminatory conduct in order to establish actionable harassment. <span class="Italic">See Torres v. Pisano</span>, No. 96-7939, 1997 WL 290196, *4 n.4 (2d Cir. June 3, 1997) ("Of course, even a single episode of harassment, if severe enough, can establish a hostile work environment."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Monsanto Chem. Co</span>., 858 F.2d 345, 349 (6th Cir. 1988) ("[P]laintiff need not prove that the instances of alleged harassment were related in either time or type. Rather all that the victim of racial harassment need show is that the alleged conduct constituted an unreasonably abusive or offensive work-related environment or adversely affected the reasonable employee's ability to do his or her job."); <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Western Southern Life Ins. Co</span>., 12 F.3d 668, 674 (7th Cir. 1993) ("Within the totality of circumstances, there is neither a threshold "magic number" of harassing incidents that gives rise, without more, to liability as a matter of law nor a number of incidents below which a plaintiff fails as a matter of law to state a claim.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Essex Group, Inc</span>., 937 F.2d 1264, 1274 n.4 (7th Cir. 1991) (recognizing that single, isolated incident of harassment can give rise to employer liability for racial harassment under Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its continued reliance on <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, this court appears to believe that only the most egregious cases will give rise to an actionable claim of a hostile work environment under Title VII. Such a belief is entirely without foundation. As the Second Circuit has noted even since I requested an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> rehearing in this case, Harris stands for a very simple and straightforward proposition:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Whenever the harassment is of such quality or quantity that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her employment altered for the worse, it is actionable under Title VII, so long as the employee subjectively experienced a hostile work environment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Torres</span>, 1997 WL 290196, *5 (citing <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 21) (emphasis added). To prove harassment, employees are held only to a standard of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That standard is designed to protect the individual employee's statutory right to work in an environment free from racial and sexual abuse. It is not intended to legitimate the discriminatory practices of a majoritarian culture. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at *5 n.7 ("What is, is not always what is right, and reasonable people can take justifiable offense at comments that the vulgar among us, even if they are a majority, would consider acceptable."); <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("The purpose of Title VII is not to import into the workplace the prejudices of the community, but through law to liberate the workplace from the demeaning influence of discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 878 (9th Cir. 1991) (harassment should be analyzed from the perspective of the victim else "[h]arassers could continue to harass merely because a particular discriminatory practice was common") (citing EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) 615, 3112, C at 3242 (1988) (courts "should consider the victim's perspective and not stereotyped notions of acceptable behavior.")); <span class="Italic">see also Winsor v. Hinkley Dodge, Inc</span>., 79 F.3d 996, 1001 (10th Cir. 1996) ("Just as we would not sanction an industry term that is facially derogatory to a particular racial or ethnic group, we cannot accept the argument that industry use of an inherently sex-related term neutralizes its detrimental effect on women.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In affirming summary judgment for the City of Las Cruces, the panel holds that it is <span class="Italic">per se</span> unreasonable for a Hispanic worker to consider what she describes as her supervisor's "frequent" references to "wetbacks" as being hostile or abusive. I am disappointed that the panel reaches that conclusion; more importantly, I can see no legal or factual basis to support it. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rodgers</span>, 12 F.3d at 675 ("Perhaps no single act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet such as 'nigger' by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.") (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Winsor</span>, 79 F.3d at 1000 (recognizing that sexual epithets are intensely degrading to women); <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co</span>., 25 F.3d 1459, 1463 (9th Cir. 1994) (derogatory use of sexually explicit and offensive terms, such as "dumb-fucking broad," sufficient to establish actionable hostile work environment claim), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 513 U.S. 1082 (1995); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1464 (use of term "UFOs--ugly fucking orientals" to refer to Asians sufficient to state actionable racial harassment claim); <span class="Italic">Boutros v. Canton Regional Transit Auth</span>., 997 F.2d 198, 202-204 (6th Cir. 1993) (allegations that supervisors repeatedly referred to Syrian-born bus driver as "camel jockey," "camel rider," "rag peddler," "heeb," and instructed him to depart from standard bus routes, then disciplined him for doing so, sufficient to state Title VII hostile work environment claim); <span class="Italic">Burns v. McGregor Elec. Indus., Inc</span>., 989 F.2d 959, 964 (8th Cir. 1993) (obscene name-calling constitutes harassment based on sex); <span class="Italic">Erebia v. Chrysler Plastic Prods. Corp</span>., 772 F.2d 1250, 1256 (6th Cir. 1985) ("repeated" use of racial slurs against Mexican-American sufficient to support hostile work environment claim under Title VII standards).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "wetback" is severely degrading. <span class="Italic">See Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251, 254 (4th Cir. 1983) (degrading epithets "deriv[e] their power to wound not only from their meaning but also from the disgust and violence they express phonetically") (quotation omitted). Accordingly, its use hardly needs to be pervasive for a Hispanic employee to find her work environment hostile and abusive--and reasonably so. <span class="Italic">See Rodgers</span>, 12 F.3d at 675-76 (use of term "nigger" twice by supervisor, in conjunction with three other racially-motivated statements, sufficient to satisfy "objective prong of the test for Title VII racial harassment claims."); <span class="Italic">cf. Ellison</span>, 924 F.2d at 878 ("[T]he required showing of severity or seriousness of the harassing conduct varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct."); EEOC Compliance Manual, 615.3112, C at 3243 (CCH) (same); <span class="Italic">Bolden</span>, 43 F.3d at 551-52 ("infrequent" racial slurs and jokes by coworkers insufficient to defeat summary judgment). While Ms. Vigil's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> allegations that the term was used "frequently" are understandably not a model of specificity or legal draftsmanship, I cannot see how the panel is able to construe those allegations to mean that the term may have been used so infrequently as to preclude Ms. Vigil's subjective perceptions of a hostile work environment from being objectively reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</span>, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (summary judgment only appropriate where non-movant "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case") (emphasis added). Her relative lack of evidence as to specific individual incidents of harassment may make a jury less likely to find her work environment objectively hostile, but that does not justify summary judgment for the defendant on grounds that her allegations of "frequent" usage are too conclusory. <span class="Italic">See Torres</span>, 1997 WL 290196, at *4 ("If a jury were to credit [the] general allegations of constant abuse..., it could reasonably find pervasive harassment, even in the absence of specific details about each incident."); <span class="Italic">Fernot v. Crafts Inn, Inc.,</span> 895 F. Supp. 668, 677 (D. Vt. 1995) ("The fact that the testimony indicated that [the supervisor] was 'always' making sexual remarks and regularly leered [at the plaintiff], rather than giving specific dates, does not negate its role in establishing a work environment of sufficiently pervasive sexual harassment."); <span class="Italic">see also DiLaurenzio v. Atlantic Paratrans, Inc</span>., 926 F. Supp. 310, 314 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (pervasiveness of harassing conduct "is the sort of issue that is often not susceptible of summary resolution."). The bottom line is that appellant's racial harassment claim is far more specific than it is conclusory. We have the what, the where, the why, and a solid enough idea of the how often.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ms. Vigil's sex-based claim is also actionable. She alleges she was subjected to constant unwelcome invitations, and exposed to pornographic, sexually explicit pictures, and sexual jokes by her immediate supervisor and other airport workers. More specifically, she alleges that her supervisor regularly requested that she go flying with him, and that when she first arrived at her job, she found pornography in a manilla <span id="Page_847"></span>folder in her desk drawer. When asked about the pornography, her supervisor stated that it had belonged to the desk's previous occupant. Another employee, however, indicated that the supervisor had given it to that previous occupant. Ms. Vigil also alleges that her supervisor offered her pornographic and "X-rated" software.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Sexual harassment is behavior that would not occur but for the sex of the employee...." <span class="Italic">Winsor</span>, 79 F.3d at 1000 (quotation omitted). From her testimony, it is obvious Ms. Vigil perceived her supervisor's invitations to be of a sexual character. Given that her would-be host allegedly offered pornographic material to appellant and may have lied about providing such material to a previous female employee, I cannot say her perception was unreasonable. We should therefore assume for summary judgment purposes that her supervisor's invitations were on account of her sex. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1000-01.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, I see no basis to conclude that her supervisor's invitations could not amount to an objectively "intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." <span class="Italic">Hirase-Doi</span>, 61 F.3d at 782 (quotation omitted). Considering the record as a whole and the totality of circumstances, including the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which they occurred, <span class="Italic">see Gross v. Burggraf Constr. Co</span>., 53 F.3d 1531, 1537 (10th Cir. 1995), appellant has alleged harassment severe or pervasive enough to constitute an objectively hostile work environment. Appellant's male supervisor constantly invited her flying despite her frequent disclaimers of interest in flying. He allegedly offered her pornographic materials and may have lied to her about his provision of similar materials to a previous female employee. Reasonable minds may differ in analyzing the sum of these facts. Ultimately, therefore, the question of whether the supervisor's sexual behavior was abusive or merely offensive should also have been left to a jury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test established by the Supreme Court for actionable harassment looks to "all the circumstances" of the harassment, including a number of factors that contribute to abusiveness, none of which is required or determinative. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 23. As Justice Scalia has recognized, "objective abusiveness" is therefore an inherently "vague" standard that provides few parameters for juries to decide when legal harm has been suffered. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 24 (Scalia, J., concurring). But, as Justice Scalia notes, there is "no test more faithful to the inherently vague statutory language," of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 25. Today, this court continues to put forward a standard for actionable harassment that is far more specific: severely degrading racist epithets must "barrage" a plaintiff before she may have recourse to the protections of federal law. In so doing, we ignore the Supreme Court's faithfulness to the language of Title VII. Our reliance on <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> contravenes the spirit and the letter of the Supreme Court's considered jurisprudence on hostile work environment claims. I respectfully dissent from my colleagues' refusal to correct this misplaced reliance.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993), eliminated any requirement that a victim of sexual harassment demonstrate severe psychological harm in order to state a claim. The Commission's own development of its case law regarding sexual harassment has, to a large degree, mirrored that of the Supreme Court. Gradually, over the course of the years, the Commission had moved slowly toward taking a position that the harassing conduct need not be so severe or pervasive as to seriously affect the psychological well-being of the complainant. Since <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the Commission specifically has overruled its previous cases to the extent that they suggest a victim of sexual harassment must show severe psychological harm to recover. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Aragon v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 05930556 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant need not allege or demonstrate psychological harm to show the environment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment, the converse is also true. A complainant cannot negate the requirement of showing the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive by alleging the conduct resulted in psychological harm. <span class="Italic">McHugh v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120056 (2012) ("Although Complainant claims to have had to seek mental health care as a result, the Commission has held that allegations that fail to state a claim cannot be converted into a viable claim merely because the complainant requests compensatory damages as a remedy.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, in <span class="Italic">Faust v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880300 (1988), the Commission explained its treatment of hostile environment cases, stating the "charged sexual harassment [must have] the effect of unreasonably interfering with [the complainant's] work performance and creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment that seriously affected her psychological well-being...." Turning to the issue of assessing the work environment in <span class="Italic">Faust</span>, the Commission said:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]hether the alleged harassment affected a term, condition or privilege of appellant's employment, it must be viewed in the context of the totality of the circumstances, considering such things as the nature of the sexual advances, the frequency of the offensive encounters, the total number of days over which all of the offensive meetings occurred and the context in which they occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ross</span>, 45 FEP Cases at 320<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 798 F.2d 210 (7th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Rabidue</span>, 805 F.2d at 620); <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934 (D.C. Cir. 1981). However, the nonexistence of one of these factors does not obviate a Title VII claim. <span class="Italic">Ross</span>, 45 FEP Cases at 320.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ in the instant complaint cited our decision in <span class="Italic">Kendra R. Meighan v. Postmaster General, U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01841219 (July 16, 1986) in which we stated that an appellant must at least identify specific conduct or behavior of a sexually explicit nature that interfered with her work. We stated there, that not all acts of sexually explicit conduct such as off-color remarks, personal invitations to go on dates, occasional touching or expressions which may be viewed as sexual innuendos are sufficient to establish unlawful sexual harassment. However, the circumstances present in the instant case go beyond those existing in that case in which the appellant merely alleged that her supervisor would leer at her and would indirectly express his interest in her and other women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the treatment which the appellant alleged she was subjected to, including the repeated unwelcome sexual jokes both prior to and during the week of May 16, 1981; the several sexual conversations the supervisor had with appellant during that week regarding her sexual relations with her husband; the other sexually suggestive comments and conduct; the subsequent offensive names; and unusually close supervision he allegedly exercised over her, <span class="Italic">would have interfered with the work performance and psychological well-being of any reasonable person</span>. This case goes beyond the mere obscenities and sexually oriented posters existing in <span class="Italic">Rabidue</span> which the Court found did not substantially affect the employee's workplace. We also note that in that case the alleged harasser was not exercising direct supervision over the complainant as in the instant case....</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 876-78 (9th Cir. 1991), a case decided prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the court provided a useful analysis of why there should be no requirement for severe psychological harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin our analysis of the third part of the framework we set forth in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> with a closer look at <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> explained that courts may properly look to guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for guidance when examining hostile environment claims of sexual harassment. 477 U.S. at 65, 106 S. Ct. at 2404-05.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court cautioned, however, that not all harassment affects a "term, condition, or privilege" of employment within the meaning of Title VII. For example, the "mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee" is not, by itself, actionable under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405. To state a claim under Title VII, sexual harassment "must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court drew its limiting language from <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1972), the first case to recognize a hostile racial environment claim under Title VII. The Rogers phrasing limits hostile environment claims to cases where conduct alters the conditions of employment and creates an abusive working environment. The EEOC guidelines, drawing upon <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> and other decisions, indicate that sexual harassment violates Title VII where conduct creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or where it unreasonably interferes with work performance. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not think that these standards are inconsistent. The Supreme Court used the words "abusive" and "hostile" synonymously in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>. 477 U.S. at 66, 106 S. Ct. at 2405. The <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> Court also approved of and paid detailed attention to the EEOC's guidelines, and it implicitly adopted the EEOC's position that sexual harassment which unreasonably interferes with work performance violates Title VII.... Conduct which unreasonably interferes with work performance can alter a condition of employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Contra</span> Pollack, "Sexual Harassment: Women's Experience vs. Legal Definitions," 13 Harv. Women's Law J. 35, 60 (1990) (arguing that the <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> court opted for the strict standard enunciated in <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> instead of the more lenient EEOC standard).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> and our previous cases establish the framework for the resolution of hostile environment cases, they do not dictate the outcome of this case. Gray's conduct falls somewhere between forcible rape and the mere utterance of an epithet. 477 U.S. at 60, 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2402, 2405-06. His conduct was not as pervasive as the sexual comments and sexual advances in <span class="Italic">Hacienda Hotel</span>, which we held created an unlawfully hostile working environment. 881 F.2d 1504.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government asks us to apply the reasoning of other courts which have declined to find Title VII violations on more egregious facts. In <span class="Italic">Scott v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 798 F.2d 210, 212 (7th Cir. 1986), the Seventh <span id="Page_848"></span>Circuit analyzed a female employee's working conditions for sexual harassment. It noted that she was repeatedly propositioned and winked at by her supervisor. When she asked for assistance, he asked "what will I get for it?" Co-workers slapped her buttocks and commented that she must moan and groan during sex. The court examined the evidence to see if "the demeaning conduct and sexual stereotyping cause[d] such anxiety and debilitation to the plaintiff that working conditions were 'poisoned' within the meaning of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 213. The court did not consider the environment sufficiently hostile. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 214.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co.</span>, 805 F.2d 611 (6th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 481 U.S. 1041, 107 S. Ct. 1983, 95 L. Ed.2d 823 (1987), the Sixth Circuit refused to find a hostile environment where the workplace contained posters of naked and partially dressed women, and where a male employee customarily called women "whores," "cunt," "pussy," and "tits," referred to plaintiff as "fat ass," and specifically stated, "All that bitch needs is a good lay." Over a strong dissent, the majority held that the sexist remarks and the pin-up posters had only a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> effect and did not seriously affect the plaintiff's psychological well-being.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree with the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Scott</span> and <span class="Italic">Rabidue</span>, and we choose not to follow those decisions. Neither <span class="Italic">Scott's</span> search for "anxiety and debilitation" sufficient to "poison" a working environment nor <span class="Italic">Rabidue's</span> requirement that a plaintiff's psychological well-being be "seriously affected" follows directly from language in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>. It is the harasser's conduct which must be pervasive or severe, not the alteration in the conditions of employment. Surely, employees need not endure sexual harassment until their psychological well-being is seriously affected to the extent that they suffer anxiety and debilitation. <span class="Italic">Accord</span>, EEOC Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment, 8 Fair Employment Practices Manual (BNA) 405:6681, 6690, n.20 (March 19, 1990). Although an isolated epithet by itself fails to support a cause of action for a hostile environment, Title VII's protection of employees from sex discrimination comes into play long before the point where victims of sexual harassment require psychiatric assistance.</p>
