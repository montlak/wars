<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-17"><span class="space">9.</span> Violent Responses to Harassment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Every person has a breaking point. When continually subjected to harassment, at some point, it becomes foreseeable that an individual may react in a threatening or violent manner. The Commission recognized that such a reaction may be justified in certain circumstances. However, the circumstances under which such a reaction is justified are by no means clear.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case involving issues of both sexual harassment and disability discrimination, the Commission left intact a decision by the MSPB to mitigate a removal to a 180-day suspension for a victim of sexual harassment who physically attacked the offending supervisor. In <span class="Italic">Colon v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03930153 (1994), the Commission reviewed a final decision by the MSPB that rejected the appellant's defense that she was disciplined as the result of sexual harassment, but found the sexual harassment constituted provocation of the assault and, therefore, warranted mitigation of the penalty.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Colon</span>, the appellant was issued a notice of removal for two incidents: 1) allegedly reporting to duty under the influence of alcohol, and 2) disorderly conduct. The first incident occurred on August 11, 1989, when appellant's second level supervisor alleged he suspected she was intoxicated at work. The appellant was taken off the job and given the option of going home or going to the agency's dispensary. Appellant chose the latter, and although a subsequent examination determined she was not intoxicated, she was sent home as a "precaution."</p>
<p class="noindent">Three days later, the appellant came to work early and confronted the second level supervisor. Appellant admitted that before the confrontation, she consumed a small amount of beer so that the supervisor would suspect her of being intoxicated and send her to the dispensary. In the resulting confrontation, the appellant became enraged and hit the supervisor with her fist, threw two cans at him, hit him in the jaw with a wooden bat, and waved her work knife at the supervisor as he fled the scene.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the Board hearing, the evidence established that appellant suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome as the result of severe sexual and physical abuse she suffered as a child. The evidence also established that on at least three occasions, the second line supervisor had engaged in <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment of the appellant by propositioning her. One of the incidents occurred on August 11, 1989, when the supervisor suggested that she could avoid discipline for being intoxicated at work if she would have sex with him. Another incident of harassment occurred just prior to the confrontation when the supervisor suggested he would not send her to the dispensary "if you give me what I want." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Testimony from four medical experts established that at the time of the confrontation, the appellant suffered a "dissociative response." During the confrontation, she envisioned the supervisor as her father, who also had been her abuser. The appellant had no control over her actions during the confrontation and did not realize what she was doing until she wielded the knife.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board's administrative judge found the agency had not presented sufficient evidence to sustain the charge of on-duty intoxication. The judge further found that the charge of disorderly conduct was, in reality, charges of assault, threats, and/or battery. Although the judge concluded that the appellant was the victim of sexual harassment, he found that she was not the victim of sex discrimination. He determined that the sexual harassment was the reason for her response to the supervisor, but was not the reason for the agency's discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">Based on the evidence presented, the administrative judge did, however, enter a finding of disability discrimination against the agency. The judge found the appellant was a qualified person with a disability and that the agency could have accommodated her by giving her periodic leave for treatment and providing a work environment free from sexual harassment. The judge reversed the agency action and ordered the appellant reinstated.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal, the Board agreed that the appellant was not subject to sex discrimination. The Board reversed the judge on the issue of disability discrimination, finding that the appellant was not a qualified person with a disability because there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate appellant was a good candidate for rehabilitation. The Board further found the charge of disorderly conduct was appropriate since such a charge does not require a demonstration of intent. Finally, the Board found that the sexual harassment of the appellant constituted provocation for the confrontation. The Board held that the removal should be reversed, but appellant should be subjected to a 180-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a very brief analysis in <span class="Italic">Colon</span>, the Commission agreed with the Board's decision using the sexual harassment for mitigation purposes only:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner first asserts in her petition for review submitted to this Commission that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of her sex because her second level supervisor engaged in comparable misconduct, yet he was not disciplined. In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination petitioner must show that she was treated differently from other similarly situated males. <span class="Italic">See Potter v. Goodwill Industries of Cleveland</span>, 518 F.2d 864, 865 (6th Cir. 1975). The Commission finds that petitioner has failed to meet this very basic requirement. Under current case law, comparative employees must be similarly situated in all relevant aspects of employment. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Monsanto Chemical Co.</span>, 770 F.2d 719, 723 (8th Cir. 1985). The comparative that petitioner cites in this case, her second level supervisor, is not similarly situated to her. While it is accepted that he engaged in sexual harassment, which is egregious, this misconduct does not resemble the "disorderly conduct" which resulted in the disciplinary action at issue in this case. Accordingly, the Commission concurs with the Board's finding of no sex discrimination. Inasmuch as we find no sex discrimination, the Commission also finds that this case is not a "mixed motive" situation as petitioner so contends, and therefore, her argument that the matter should be considered <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is without merit. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner also asserts that a finding of sex discrimination should be made, inasmuch as her second level supervisor was found to have sexually harassed her. Petitioner correctly cites the principle that where a supervisor is found to have engaged in <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment, the agency must be held strictly liable for his misconduct. Petitioner claims in addition that the agency did nothing to investigate the allegation of sexual harassment that she made, and therefore, punished the victim in this case in violation of Commission policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes first and foremost in its analysis of this issue that petitioner does not dispute the finding of sexual harassment. Thus, the Commission takes judicial notice of the fact that sexual harassment did occur in this case. Nonetheless, we concur with the analysis set forth by the AJ in this case that the sexual harassment that did occur was related to petitioner's misconduct, not the discipline taken by the agency. Although petitioner makes the argument that the agency's action was "inextricably intertwined" with the sexual harassment because petitioner's response was a "defense" to the sexual harassment, we disagree. The Commission finds instead that the relationship between the sexual harassment and the disciplinary action taken in this case is too attenuated to support a finding that the agency's action was tantamount to an act of sex discrimination.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The Commission notes that the finding of no sex discrimination in this case should not detract from the finding that sexual harassment provoked petitioner's dissociative response. There is ample evidence in the record to support this finding. Moreover, the Commission notes with concern that there is no evidence in the record that petitioner's second level supervisor was disciplined for his misconduct, or that assurances were made that petitioner would never again work under her second level supervisor. The agency would be well advised to take such remedial action. Nonetheless, we agree with the Board that this issue is not the subject of this case, inasmuch as there is no evidence that the sexual harassment played any role in the agency's decision to discipline petitioner.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also sided with the Board on the disability discrimination issue on the basis that, at the time of her removal, the appellant had presented no evidence to the agency that she could resume the duties of her position without risk of further incident.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Colon</span> case raises several difficult issues. On the one hand, the Commission is correct that the appellant and her supervisor were not similarly situated in terms of the kind of misconduct in which they engaged. However, the exclusive focus on whether they were similarly situated seems to sidestep the question of whether sex was a factor in the agency's decision to discipline appellant for disorderly conduct, while imposing no discipline on the supervisor for engaging in sexual harassment. As the Supreme Court reiterated in <span class="Italic">Hicks, supra</span>, resolving the ultimate issue in a discrimination case is not contingent <span id="Page_811"></span>on rigidly applying any particular formula for analyzing the case, but on determining whether the employer was motivated by discriminatory reasons. Merely noting that the appellant and the supervisor were not similarly situated seems to beg that question, particularly where the acts of misconduct, though not similar in character, are certainly inextricably intertwined.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next, while the author does not condone violence as a response, it can forcefully be argued in this case that the supervisor, in sexually harassing the appellant, ran the risk of encountering the very situation that became reality in this case. Perhaps substituting a suspension for a removal is not an inequitable remedy in this case, but doing so on the basis that the relationship between the sexual harassment and the removal is "too attenuated" is questionable. A far better analysis, it would seem, would acknowledge the direct relationship between the sexual harassment and the removal, but to conclude that, on the facts of this case, the agency could fulfill its burden of demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken disciplinary action even absent discrimination. The rationale embraced by the Board and the Commission seems less defensible in the end. For example, if the appellant had simply walked off the job site and refused to return to work, instead of confronting her supervisor, would the Commission and the Board conclude that there was an insufficient connection between the sexual harassment and any resulting charge of absence without leave? Such a result seems unlikely. The focus should not be on whether the victim's response removes the supervisor's actions from the ambit of sexual harassment, but whether the agency would be justified in disciplining the victim irrespective of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any mention of the <span class="Italic">Colon</span> case, the Commission rejected the complainant's alleged threatening behavior as a legitimate reason for his removal in a case in which it found that any such behavior was a foreseeable consequence of extreme racial harassment. In <span class="Italic">Talabi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965276 (1998), there was evidence of an extremely offensive, pervasive hostile work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the appellant was subjected to severe and pervasive harassment because he is a black Nigerian. Agency officials were aware of the unwelcome racial epithets and other intimidating, hostile and offensive conduct to which the appellant was subjected by his coworkers but they failed to take any action to stop it. The AJ found that neither the appellant's supervisor, Customer Services Supervisor C.M., nor other management officials were credible in their denial that they had not seen the offensive drawings regarding the appellant in a bathroom used by both the employees and the management. The drawing was a derogatory caricature depicting the appellant as an African native in a loin cloth with a bone in his hair. Other witnesses credibly testified that racially offensive remarks against the appellant were made in the presence of agency officials and were otherwise brought to their attention. The agency management disregarded even a shop steward's attempts to bring the racially offensive drawing and remarks to the managements attention. Among the numerous insulting remarks addressed to the appellant by several co-workers were: "we are not in Africa," "go back to Africa," "nigger," "witch doctor," "dirty African," "Nigerian snake," and "jungle bunny."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission agreed with the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Talabi</span> that any perceived threatening behavior on the complainant's part was the foreseeable reaction to his work environment, and the agency's inaction in addressing it:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ rejected the agency's articulated reasons for the appellant's termination as a pretext for unlawful discrimination, the agency relied upon the appellant's alleged disruptive and threatening conduct toward a co-worker on two occasions in March and April 1992, and that this conduct was in violation of an April 1991 last chance agreement pursuant to which the appellant was previously reinstated. The AJ found that the appellant's "increasing frustration and outbursts were the natural, foreseeable, and to-be-expected, consequence of management's inaction." The AJ did not find the agency's explanation credible that the appellant had engaged in a threatening manner, other than to express his verbal frustration in view of the "outrageous" and "intentionally demeaning" hostile work environment condoned by the agency management.</p>
