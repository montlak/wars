<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-15"><span class="space">1.</span> Displacement of Beneficiaries of Discrimination/"Bumping"</h4>
<p class="noindent">Beginning with the 1987 amendments to Part 1613, the Commission made a substantial departure from its former views on relief for employees and applicants for employment, insofar as they require placement in the actual position denied as a result of discrimination, unless the agency can justify placement in a substantially equivalent position. In the past, the Commission often ordered relief in the form of a comparable position in the first instance. The Commission reasoned that the employee originally selected was not at fault and should not be punished for the misdeeds of others. The Commission's comments on the 1987 regulations, at 52 Fed. Reg. 41,921-22 (1987), indicated that it would require some degree of justification to approve an offer of an equivalent position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Many commentators objected to the requirement of nondiscriminatory placement. For all the reasons explained below, the Commission believes that nondiscriminatory placement, as a presumptive remedy, unless extraordinary circumstances exist, is the appropriate standard. The remedial provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, after which the remedial provisions of section 717 of Title VII and section 15 of the ADEA were patterned, have long been interpreted to require nondiscriminatory placement, even in those instances where it causes the displacement of an incumbent employee. The nondiscriminatory placement remedy, as enunciated in the Commission's Policy Statement, applies only to individual cases of discrimination and is available only to victims of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A presumptive entitlement to nondiscriminatory placement is consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions that backpay and retroactive seniority are presumptive remedies that can be denied only for reasons that would not frustrate the goals of eradicating discrimination and providing make-whole relief. It would not be consistent with the goals of eradicating discrimination to routinely deny nondiscriminatory placement merely because the employer had filled the position. In the Commission's view, the balance of equities is with the victim of discrimination who would have had the position but for the discrimination, rather than the employee who obtained the position as a result of the employer's discrimination, although the primary burden of the remedy must be borne in all instances by the employing agency, rather than innocent third parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is assumed that agencies will, when possible, prefer to offer a substantially equivalent position rather than displacing an incumbent to make way for the victim of discrimination, since such placement would require a new placement of two persons, the victim and the person displaced. Such a preference is consistent with the Remedies Policy, which seeks to ensure that the victim is made whole, but does not forbid agencies from accomplishing that objective in the least disruptive manner possible.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations and guidance, including Part 1614, remain unclear on what burden the agency must fulfill in determining that an offer of a substantially equivalent position is preferable to displacement. Because victims of discrimination are likely to feel an entitlement to the actual position denied and be suspect of alternative positions, it is highly probable the Commission will have ample opportunity to issue further guidance on the subject. There are no easy solutions in this area. As the Commission rightly acknowledges, there is a natural tension between the interests of the victim of discrimination in being made whole and the innocent third party who faces displacement through no fault of his or her own. Into this equation, the Commission must account for the occasional agency official who will seek to comply with the letter, but not the spirit of a relief order by placing the victim in a less desirable position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where there is no substantially equivalent position available, however, bumping the incumbent of the position may be the only viable way for the agency to comply with a relief order. In <span class="Italic">Geraldine G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420170001 (2017), for instance, the Commission upheld an order to the agency to place the complainant in the team leader position she was discriminatorily denied, even if the incumbent had to be bumped, and noted that placing the complainant in a position that was geographically remote from the denied position does not satisfy the substantially equivalent requirement. The administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Geraldine G.</span> found that the agency discriminated against the complainant when it failed to select her for a promotion to a GS-14 as a postal inspector team leader in St. Paul, Minnesota and ordered the agency to offer the complainant a GS-14 postal inspector team leader position in St. Paul or a substantially equivalent position at a mutually agreed upon location. The agency rejected that order and filed an appeal with the Commission. The Commission upheld the order. The agency then offered the complainant similar positions in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Newark, Miami and Washington D.C., and the complainant filed a petition for enforcement, alleging noncompliance with the order. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Geraldine G.</span> upheld order even if it meant bumping the incumbent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency was required to offer Petitioner a position as a Postal Inspector Team Leader, Level 14, in St. Paul, Minnesota, or "a substantially equivalent position." The Commission has consistently held that a substantially equivalent position is one that is similar in duties, responsibilities, and location (reasonable commuting distance) to the position for which the complainant originally applied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Monroig v. U.S. Comm'n on Civil Rights</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04A40029 (Sept. 29, 2005); <span class="Italic">Spicer v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04980007 (Sept. 24, 1998); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940079 (Oct. 21, 1994). The burden is on the Agency to establish that the position offered to complainant in fact is substantially equivalent to the position lost. <span class="Italic">See Rai v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01901186 (May 17, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1704"></span>The Agency contended that it could not offer Petitioner the Team Leader Level 14 position in St. Paul because no such position was available. Instead, the Agency offered Petitioner six Team Leader Level 14 positions and two Program Manager Level 14 positions located in various areas throughout the country. The Commission finds the positions offered were not substantially equivalent to the Team Leader position denied to Petitioner. Specifically, the positions offered were not in geographic/commuting locations remotely close to the position that Petitioner was discriminatorily denied. Therefore, the Commission finds that the Agency is not in compliance with the previous Order. <span class="Italic">See Carroll v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420070018 (Feb. 29, 2008) (position offered in another geographic location not substantially equivalent to position denied to petitioner).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further notes that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501 expressly provides for an unconditional offer of placement in the position the victim of discrimination would have occupied absent discrimination or in a "substantially equivalent" position. The Agency maintained that it is unable to offer Petitioner the St. Paul position because it is no longer vacant and is currently occupied by an incumbent employee who apparently was selected over Petitioner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there may be some disagreement among the Federal circuits, case law from federal courts and the Commission recognizes the bumping of an incumbent employee as a possible remedy for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Padilla, Jr. v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A20031 (Sept. 30, 2003); <span class="Italic">Sheth v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A10011(Mar. 8, 2001); <span class="Italic">Myers v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 04950028 (May 2, 1996); <span class="Italic">Banks v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920680 (Mar. 4, 1994) at n.5; <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04910005 (Aug. 1, 1991); <span class="Italic">Bruno v. City of Crown Point, Indiana</span>, 950 F.2d 355, 360 (7th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 505 U.S. 1207 (1992); <span class="Italic">Lander v. Lujan</span>, 888 F.2d 153, 156-58 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ("[B]umping in this case accords with the broad guidelines that the Supreme Court has provided on the proper scope of Title VII remedies.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Commission has previously held that the bumping of an incumbent is a permissible remedy when, in the absence of bumping, the petitioner's relief would be unjustly inadequate. <span class="Italic">Padilla, Jr</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A20031 (citing <span class="Italic">Kerschner, Jr. v. Dep't of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933023(Mar. 15, 1994)); <span class="Italic">Harness v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01920294 (June 16, 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Lujan</span>, 88 F. 2d, at 156-58). If there is no position available that is substantially equivalent to the positions petitioner was discriminatorily denied, bumping of an incumbent may be the only adequate remedy. <span class="Italic">Padilla, Jr</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A20031.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is apparently no substantially equivalent position in terms of commuting distance with regard to the St. Paul position, a position which Petitioner was discriminatorily denied. The Agency's offering of positions in completely different geographical locations throughout the country is plainly an unjustly inadequate remedy. As there is no substantially equivalent position to the Team Leader, Level 14 position at the St. Paul, Minnesota location, the Commission finds that bumping the incumbent employee is the only remedy that would make Petitioner whole under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Franks v. Bowman Transpor. Co., Inc.,</span> 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976); <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled to be placed in the St. Paul Team Leader, Level 14 position, even if it means bumping the individual who was selected over her. <span class="Italic">See Sheth</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04A10011 (petitioner entitled to be placed in the original position for which he was not selected, even if it means removing one of the original selectees); <span class="Italic">Padilla, Jr</span>. EEOC Petition No. 04A20031 (petitioner discriminatorily not selected to multiple geographic locations entitled to the location of his choice and to bump an incumbent employee selected over him when no substantially similar position was available).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880060 (1988), the Commission denied the agency's request to reopen, filed on the basis that placing the complainant in the position she was denied would result in the displacement of an innocent beneficiary of discrimination. Responding to this argument in <span class="Italic">McDonald</span>, the Commission said:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the policy of this Commission that each identified victim of discrimination is entitled to an immediate and unconditional offer of placement in the respondent's [agency's] work force, to the position the discriminatee would have occupied absent discrimination, or to a substantially equal position, even if placement of the discriminatee results in the displacement of another of respondent's employees....Further, it is the Commission's position that it would not be consistent with the goal of eradicating discrimination to routinely deny nondiscriminatory placement merely because the employer has filled the position. In the Commission's view, the balance of equities is with the victim of discrimination who would have had the position but for discrimination, rather than with the employee who obtained the position as a result of the employer's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission stressed that under this policy, the agency only can avoid displacement of the selectee where "such displacement is 'clearly inappropriate in a given setting, or is unavailable as a remedy in a particular jurisdiction.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting Appendix A to 29 CFR Part 1613--Policy Statement on Remedies and Relief for Individual Cases of Unlawful Discrimination, 52 Fed. Reg. 41,933 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bianchi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883671 (1989), the Commission noted that displacing the innocent beneficiary of discrimination may be "regrettable, [but] it is clearly allowed by federal regulation and may be necessary to provide adequate relief under Title VII." In deciding that promoting the complainant and transferring him from a facility in Staten Island to one in Brooklyn was not adequate relief, the EEOC took special note of the complainant's statement that he worked for over 20 years at the Staten Island facility and passed up other promotional opportunities to remain at Staten Island. "The whole tone of appellant's statement to us indicates that he considers the proposed transfer to Brooklyn to be a banishment which only continues the injuries wrought by the initial discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Noting the additional commuting time and expenses and the complainant's history at Staten Island, the Commission equated the Brooklyn transfer with a significant change in the conditions under which he worked.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission appears to have become progressively tougher on agencies seeking to justify the offer of a substantially equivalent position. For example, in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 05900708 (1990), the agency argued that the complainant should not be entitled to the position he was actually denied because the original selectee no longer held the position. The original selectee had since been replaced with another employee with more seniority than the complainant. The agency argued that because the employee currently holding the position "is an innocent third party with more agency service than appellant, [and] he should not be displaced in order to give the position to appellant when, in fact, appellant has been offered a comparable position...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> To require such a remedy, the agency contended, would place the complainant in a better position than he would have been in absent discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission noted that the agency's argument would only hold true if there were two similar positions at the time of the original selection and one position was subsequently eliminated. Then, the employee with the most seniority would have been permitted to stay. Because it was not clear from the existing record how many positions existed at the time of the complainant's nonselection, the Commission remanded the case for further investigation. The Commission also cautioned the agency in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize, however, that even if we should determine that bumping the current [employee]...is not the most appropriate remedy, the agency will not be allowed to place appellant in a <span class="Italic">worse</span> position than he would have occupied absent the discrimination. Thus, even if we find that appellant is not entitled to the position..., his options would be to accept a transfer to another plant or remain in the position he occupied...at the time the agency issued its finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether a victim of discrimination should replace an innocent beneficiary of discrimination, the Commission engages in a balancing test. Among the factors considered by the Commission are whether the victim was inequitably deprived of opportunities conferred upon the beneficiary and also whether the agency has shown any recalcitrance in complying with Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Myers v. Postmaster General</span>, 04950028 (1996), the Commission determined those equities weighed in favor of the victim where the agency reinstated her to a different position and told her she could have the disputed position as soon as it was vacated by the original selectee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission first addresses the issue of placement in the Storekeeper position. The Commission's May 26, 1994 Order expressly and clearly directed the agency to place petitioner in the position of Storekeeper, Automotive Parts, retroactive to June 1990. No fair reading of the plain language of the Order permits an interpretation of the order which would allow the agency to substitute placement in another position for the one ordered, much less to require petitioner to work on a different shift performing lower-level job duties that are more physically burdensome. It is uncontested that the agency completed the necessary paperwork to promote petitioner to the Storekeeper, Automotive Parts, PS-06 position on August 20, 1994, retroactive to June 16, 1990. However, it also is uncontested that the agency informed the petitioner on August 23, 1994, that she was to report to duty at 2300 on Tour 1, her prior mailhandler schedule, to perform mailhandler duties until such time that Selectee C vacated the Storekeeper position. It further is uncontested that petitioner reported for duty as directed by the agency. There is no indication in the record that the agency has permitted petitioner to perform the duties of the Storekeeper position from August 23, 1994 to the present. Accordingly, we find that the agency has failed to comply with the Commission's May 26, 1994 Order to place petitioner in the position of Storekeeper, Automotive Parts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency notified petitioner that she was to perform mailhandler duties until such time that Selectee C vacated the Storekeeper position. Although there is some disagreement among the circuits, case law <span id="Page_1705"></span>from the federal courts and EEOC decisions recognize bumping of an incumbent employee as a possible remedy for discrimination<span class="Italic">. Ella Banks v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920680 (March 4, 1994) at n.5; <span class="Italic">Arthur M. Kerschner, Jr. v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933023 (March 15, 1994); <span class="Italic">Ann M. Mitchell v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04910005 (August 1, 1991); <span class="Italic">Bruno v.

Lujan</span>, 888 F.2d 153, 156-58 (D.C. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Walters v. City of Atlanta</span>, 803 F.2d 1135, 1148-50 (11th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Muscle Shoals Bd. of Educ.</span>, 790 F.2d. 1515, 1522-24 (11th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII expressly authorizes hiring and reinstatement orders to remedy discrimination. 42 USC 2000e-5(g) (1), 2000e-16(b). Thereby, EEOC and the courts can effectuate the purpose of Title VII which is "to make the victims of unlawful discrimination whole" by putting them in the "position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 421 (1975)<span class="Italic">. See also Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.</span>, Inc., 424 U.S. 747, 764-66 (1976) (slotting the discrimination victim in the position in the seniority system that would have been his had he been hired at the time of his application is necessary to achieve the make-whole purpose of Title VII). Bumping is a clearly authorized and even commonplace remedy under the National Labor Relations Act upon which Title VII was expressly modeled<span class="Italic">. Lander v. Lujan</span>, 888 F.2d at 156. As to employment by federal agencies, bumping is the presumptive remedy when the Merit Systems Protection Board finds an unlawful demotion or discharge in violation of the Civil Service System<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 157. Courts have also utilized bumping to remedy constitutional violations<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Banks v. Burkich</span>, 788 F.2d 1161, 1164-65 (6th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hiring and reinstatement relief is equitable in nature. It is permissible for a trier of fact to consider the effect of a proposed promotion remedy on an incumbent in the position at issue<span class="Italic">. See EEOC v. Ford Motor Company</span>, 458 U.S. 219, 239 (1982); <span class="Italic">Lander v. Lujan</span>, 888 F.2d at 157; <span class="Italic">Walters v. City of Atlanta</span>, 803 F.2d at 1149.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the balance of the equities weigh in favor of the petitioner over Selectee C. If the agency had not discriminated against the petitioner in the June 1990 selection, it would have selected her for the position and placed her therein. Because of the agency's discrimination against the petitioner, she has not had the opportunity to gain experience in the Storekeeper duties that could qualify her for promotions in the future. In contrast, Selectee C applied for the Storekeeper position in June 1990. At that time the Selecting Official determined that the petitioner was better qualified for the position than Selectee C. There is no persuasive evidence in the record that Selectee C would have had the opportunity to reapply for the position and be selected in March 1991 absent the agency's discrimination against the petitioner. Thus, while the agency was the wrongdoer in this situation and not Selectee C or the petitioner, the petitioner's losses have been Selectee C's gains.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, due to the agency's discriminatory action, Selectee C has enjoyed the specific employment benefits that would have been granted to the petitioner, not Selectee C, but for the agency's discrimination. This situation is inequitable<span class="Italic">. See Lander v. Lujan</span> at 157 ("we see no indication in the statute nor in logic to lead us to conclude that ordinarily the innocent beneficiary has a superior equitable claim to the job <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> the victim of discrimination"); <span class="Italic">see also Walters v. City of Atlanta</span>, 803 F. 2d at 1149 (not to allow the bumping of a direct beneficiary of repeated discrimination by the direct victim of the same acts of discrimination would penalize the plaintiff who won his suit but lost the race to fill the position he had been unlawfully denied). There is no reason to believe that the Storekeeper position will become vacant in the foreseeable future, given the agency's on-going downsizing. Nor has the agency indicated that there is a substantially similar position in which they could place the petitioner in lieu of bumping Selectee C. Under these circumstances, the purpose of Title VII, to make-whole the victims of discrimination, can only be served by placing the petitioner in the Storekeeper position even though this would require the agency to reassign Selectee C to another PS-06 position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An additional factor to weigh when considering the equities of the situation is the employer's recalcitrance in complying with the mandates of Title VII<span class="Italic">. See Brewer v. Muscle Shoals Bd. of Educ.</span>, 790 F.2d. at 1523 (employer's recalcitrance shown by filling of vacancies after notice of breach of Title VII settlement agreement allegations). In the instant case, the agency had notice of petitioner's first and second discrimination complaints prior to its placing Selectee C in the position in March 1991<span class="Italic">. See also Walters v. City of Atlanta</span>, 803 F.2d at 1149 (employer's recalcitrance evidenced by repeated discriminatory actions after it was on notice of the plaintiff's allegations of discrimination). Further, the agency has been on notice since the Commission's decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01930065 (April 22, 1993) of the order to place petitioner in the Storekeeper position. Notwithstanding such notice, the agency failed to argue in its request for reconsideration that it could not comply with the EEOC's April 22, 1993 Order because the Storekeeper position was encumbered and, therefore, that placement in a substantially similar position would be a more appropriate remedy<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 614.501(a)(3). Nor is there any indication that the agency has made any effort to locate a substantially similar position in which to place the petitioners. Instead, while promoting the petitioner to the PS-06 Storekeeper position on paper, the agency has required her to perform physically burdensome PS-4 level duties on the night shift rather than attempting to find the petitioner day shift duties consistent with the duties and hours of the Storekeeper position. The agency has offered no explanation for these actions. Taken together, the agency's actions demonstrate a recalcitrance equal to, if not greater than, the recalcitrance of the employers in the <span class="Italic">Walters</span> and the <span class="Italic">Brewer</span> cases where bumping was found to be an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, we order the agency to place the petitioner in the Storekeeper position within ten days of the agency's receipt of this decision.</p>

Secretary of Army</span>, 04A100011 (2001) ("The Commission has previously taken judicial notice that 'bumping' of an incumbent is a permissible remedy when in the absence of such bumping, the complainant's relief would be unjustly inadequate.").</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency does cancel a personnel action due to discrimination and the cancelation results in displacement of an employee, that employee must be replaced by "a victim of discrimination." The agency errs when it rescinds the appointment, screens applicants, and selects a candidate who was not the victim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Adams v. USPS</span>, 01841286 (1987).</p>
