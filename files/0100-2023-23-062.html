<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-61"><span class="space">6.</span> Performance of Essential Job Functions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The employee must establish that he or she can perform the essential functions of the position with or without accommodation in order to be qualified. To do that, an employee may rely on the previous year's performance evaluation. <span class="Italic">See Tanya D. v. Attorney General</span>, 2022002544 (2022) (relying on a statement from the Assistant Special Agent in Charge that "she has worked with Complainant since 2011 and to her knowledge, Complainant is fit for duty and has consistently been rated 'Successful' and 'Excellent' on her performance appraisals in that time" to determine whether complainant was a "qualified individual with a disability"); <span class="Italic">Ruben T. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120171405 (2019) ("The record established that Complainant can perform the essential functions of his position. Complainant received a "Successful" performance rating on October 24, 2019, for the previous fiscal year.")</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee fails, however, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination unless she can demonstrate that she can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. For example, an employee whose quality of work performance is good, but who cannot meet a reduced quantity level has failed to establish that she can perform the essential position functions with accommodation. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Treasury</span>, 03820069 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee indicates that he cannot perform the essential job functions and that there is no accommodation that would help him do so, he is not qualified as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122582 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find no failure to accommodate on the part of the Agency because Complainant cannot perform the essential functions of his position. At the very least, he cannot use his left arm in the performance of essential functions as a Mail Processing Clerk. Accordingly, Complainant is not a qualified person with a disability. The Agency was only required to provide an accommodation to Complainant if Complainant were able to perform the essential functions of his position, with or without an accommodation. Complainant, by his own statement and that of his physician, cannot use his left arm. He has not shown that his inability to use his left arm can be accommodated. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01962747 (Oct. 22, 1998) (complainant must make at least a facial showing that his disability can be accommodated) (citing <span class="Italic">Treadwell v. Alexander</span>, 707 F.2d 453, 477-78 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also Major D. v. Postmaster General,</span> 2019005750 (2021) (complainant did not demonstrate he is a qualified individual with disability where his increased physical limitations relegated him to being able only to case mail for two hours a day even with an accommodation; "The Rehabilitation Act does not require the Agency to consider accommodating complainant's restrictions by creating a "make work" assignment because such an assignment is not a vacant, funded position.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did a good job of weighing the complainant's performance of the essential job functions against his physical limitations in <span class="Italic">Alden V. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120151743 (2017). The complainant in that case was a sales associate in charge of "customer service at various selling centers, operating a cash register, practicing loss prevention procedures and other duties." Per his doctor's order, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Alden V.</span> was under the following medical restrictions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">--Working only in his former work environment;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1170"></span>The Commission found that the complainant was not a "qualified individual" based on his restrictions in <span class="Italic">Alden V</span>., explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that although the Station Manager had retired from the Agency at the time of the investigation, we find there is sufficient evidence in the record to support our conclusion that Complainant was not a "qualified" individual with a disability even without her testimony. The record reveals Complainant was out of work for months at a time and had been accommodated with a reduced schedule and duties for two or three years. When Complainant returned to work from a lengthy absence in March 2013, he continued to have unscheduled absences even under his limited schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even with an accommodation, there is evidence in the record to support the Agency's position that Complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of the job. Complainant's first level supervisor averred that he needed to help Complainant lifting things under 20 pounds. The Operations Manager averred that Complainant complained of being sore all the time, had difficulty walking to the containers and standing for his Western Union duties. The undisputed record reveals the Agency was forced to hire a temporary associate to cover the schedule and perform the duties that Complainant was unable to perform. The record also reveals the Agency considered an administrative position for Complainant, but Complainant's physician restricted him to remain in the Sales Associate position. Accordingly, we find the Agency investigated reassignment as an accommodation, but was unable to place Complainant because of his restrictions. Furthermore, we note that after the Station Manager denied Complainant's restrictions and placed him back on LWOP in May 2013, Complainant refused requests to meet with the Agency to discuss the matter further. Accordingly, we cannot find that Complainant was denied an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for the agency to conclude that an employee is not disabled because she continues to perform the duties of her position at a satisfactory level despite her disability. <span class="Italic">Maas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01872823 (1988). Nor does it negate the agency's obligation to provide accommodation where the employee's physician indicates that her performance of duties is aggravating her condition and recommends accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Klinkert v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120073845 (2009), the Commission found that the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability where he maintained that he could not work at the agency's facility. In addition to finding that the complainant could not perform some functions of his position off agency premises, the Commission also noted that because of past performance problems the complainant needed close supervision in order to meet deadlines that were an essential function of the position. As a result, the complainant was not qualified to perform the essential functions of the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who contends that he cannot perform an essential job function is not a qualified individual with a disability. For example, in <span class="Italic">Moran v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120083639 (2009), the complainant had been informally accommodated by the agency in that he was not required to perform duties that required interaction with the public. He then bid on and received a position as a window clerk. The complainant then sought accommodation on the basis that his disability substantially limited his ability to interact with others. As an accommodation, he sought relief from the function of interacting with the public. The Commission found that interacting with the public was an essential element of the position and that by his own admission the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bumpus v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120082947 (2011), holding that employee whose position required driving a GOV five to six times a week and who could not drive was not qualified and, in any event, the accommodation request--to be assigned a driver--was not reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, since supervising employees is an essential function of being a supervisor, a supervisor who cannot perform that task cannot perform an essential function of the position and is not qualified. In <span class="Italic">Kane v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112749 (2011), the complainant was a manager of customer services at what appears to be a particularly dysfunctional post office. The complainant contended, among other things, that he was subject of harassment by female employees in the form of multiple complaints being filed against him. He also asserted that this led to an anxiety disorder and PTSD. He also had an incident involving two black female police officers that resulted in his arrest after passing their vehicle on the right in a bicycle lane and then fleeing the scene after being stopped. The complainant contended that he could no longer supervise black female employees. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kane</span>, found the complainant was not qualified to be a supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record includes the position description of an EAS-20 manager of customer services. The position calls for a manager to manage the activities of a large station or branch with a large to very large number of employees. Complainant averred in his affidavit that one of the essential functions of his position as an EAS-20 Manager of Customer Services was to "[s]upervise and manage approximately 23 employees." Complainant's Aff. at 4. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that one of the essential functions of being a manager or supervisor is to manage or supervise employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's medical documents, however, have consistently revealed a need, independent of work location, to work in a non-confrontational environment that immunizes him from the possibility of further accusations and allegations by subordinates. This need has manifested itself in various ways. First, and most relevant to this case, is his psychiatrist's May 12, 2009 recommendation that Complainant cannot work with subordinate employees by himself, but must always have another supervisor present to act as a possible witness, lest he be accused of doing something by an employee. The second manifestation of this need occurred during his arrest, when he suddenly felt the need for a supervisor to witness the two black female police officers pulling him over.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Complainant averred in his February 4, 2010 affidavit that his post traumatic stress disorder causes him to experience an overwhelming desire to flee any situation that includes working with, supervising, and socializing with black females. Complainant's Aff. at 3. We find this has manifested itself in his fleeing from two black female police officers, as well as his call to the OWCP customer services number, demanding that he not have a black Claims Examiner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the symptoms of Complainant's disorders, the phobia of black females and the persistent suspicion of all subordinate employees as possible instigators of false accusations, have rendered Complainant unable to perform the essential function of managing or supervising employees. His request to be placed in a work environment that immunizes him from all future employee allegations, EEO-related or otherwise, is an accommodation that no employer can provide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer can reasonably accommodate an employee with a disability-related occupational injury by restructuring a position through the reallocation or redistribution of marginal functions that the employee cannot perform because of the disability, but an employer cannot eliminate the essential functions of a position. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Workers' Compensation and the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at Question 20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency cannot accommodate Complainant's needs, suspicions, and phobias by restructuring a managerial or supervisory position by reallocating to him marginal administrative tasks while eliminating the essential function of managing and supervising employees. Therefore, we find that Complainant is not a "qualified" individual with a disability because he cannot perform the essential functions of a managerial or supervisory position, with or without a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If he is not qualified to work in a supervisory position, then we must analyze whether he can be reassigned to a lower-graded position for which he is qualified, absent undue hardship, but it is not apparent that there is a lower-graded position for which he could perform the essential duties, given his work restrictions and the increased likelihood of interacting with formerly subordinate employees. Nor does having Complainant work alone seem to be a viable option, since he had previously declined to walk on carrier routes by himself in Long Island City, stating that this task violated his medical restriction of working alone. As such, we determine that Complainant is not a "qualified" individual with a disability because he can no longer perform the essential functions of a supervisory position or lower-graded position, with or without a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Moreover, a supervisor asking an employee, who admittedly cannot perform essential job functions, about retirement is not indicative of discrimination as the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Concha E. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120140732 (2016). In <span class="Italic">Concha E.</span>, the complainant alleged that her supervisor attempted to force her retirement by assigning the complainant a disparate amount of work, which aggravated the complainant's medical condition. The complainant's supervisor countered that the complainant had the skills and background to accomplish the tasks assigned to her, but that the complainant refused the work, stating that she was unable to complete it. The supervisor further admitted to discussing retirement with the complainant, but stated that the conversation was in an effort to apprise the complainant of her options. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Concha E</span>. declined to find that such discussions are necessarily evidence of discriminatory animus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Complainant's claim that S1 tried to force her from the workforce, we note that Complainant essentially asserted that she could not perform core functions of her position when she objected to preparing MD-715 reports. As such, S1 was justified in apprising Complainant of all her options, including retirement. We find no evidence that S1's comments about retirement were intended to intimate or harass Complainant. Therefore, we do not find that Complainant has shown that the Agency's explanations are pretext for unlawful discrimination. Likewise, a finding of a hostile work environment is precluded by our determination that Complainant has not established that any of the actions taken by the Agency as set forth above were motivated by discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">See Oakley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01982923 (Sept. 21, 2000); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Mar. 8, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Washington v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120110972 (2013), where <span id="Page_1171"></span>the complainant, a lead transportation security officer, suffered from anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The complainant alleged that the conditions were the result of sexual harassment, but the Commission noted that three civil actions brought by the complainant had resulted in findings of no discrimination. Complainant's anxiety, however, was accepted by OWCP as a work-related injury. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the central legal issue is whether Complainant could perform the essential functions of a Lead Transportation Security Officer at the time when the Agency removed her in 2008. According to the "Job Analysis Tool," the duties and responsibilities of a lead officer include: leading at least three officers; distributing and balancing workload and tasks among employees; overseeing security screening team; resolving informal complaints of employees; training team members; conducting screenings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Core competencies include: an attention to detail, interpersonal skills, multi-tasking, and oral communication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the medical documentation, we find that the AJ did not err in concluding that Complainant could not perform the essential functions of a Lead Transportation Security Officer in 2008. The record includes the second opinion of a psychiatrist who examined Complainant in January 2008. He wrote that Complainant could not return to her job because of her inability to concentrate, her anxiety, her difficulty with memory, and her feelings of being terrified of going anywhere near her previous workplace in the airport.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And on December 8, 2008, a few months after the Agency terminated Complainant, Complainant's physician wrote that Complainant continued to experience acute reaction to stress, major depressive disorder, severe dissociative disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. "She continues in treatment and is not able to return to work in any capacity as she is fully disabled. She has never been released from my care at any time since [2004]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the medical documents in the record, we agree with the AJ's determination that Complainant was not a "qualified" individual with a disability, because her mental impairments rendered her unable to return to work in 2008 as Lead Transportation Security Officer. Her own treating physician, along with a second opinion from another psychiatrist, both opined in 2008 that Complainant was not able to return to work in any capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Complainant attempts to introduce for the first time on appeal a "Physician Review Report" on Complainant's workers' compensation case that was written two years after her termination, we will not accept this new evidence on appeal. Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110) (rev. Nov. 9, 1999), &#x00A7; Vl(A)(3). The report appears to focus primarily on the objective merits of the Department of Labor's assessment that Complainant was permanently and totally disabled. But we note that an employee's rights under the Rehabilitation Act are separate from her entitlements under a workers' compensation law. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Workers' Compensation and the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at Question 25 (Sept. 3, 1996). The purpose of the Rehabilitation Act is to prohibit federal agencies from discriminating against qualified individuals because of disability in all aspects of employment. On the other hand, the purpose of a workers' compensation law is to provide a system for securing prompt and fair settlement of employees' claims against employers for occupational injury and illness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because there is nothing in the record that affirmatively demonstrates that Complainant was capable of returning to work in 2008 when the Agency terminated her, we find that she failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the basis of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the employee is approved for disability retirement does not prevent a finding that he is a qualified individual with a disability, particularly where the retirement application is approved on the basis of a different disability from the one for which the complainant sought accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Irvin v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01990867 (2000); <span class="Italic">see also</span> "<a href="0100-2023-23-073.html#sec14-71">Effect of Disability Retirement</a>," above.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission has not established a bright-line test for the degree to which an employee must be able to perform the essential duties of her position, an employee who can only perform the essential duties of her position 75% of the time is not a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Peters v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956940 (1998).</p>
