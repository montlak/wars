<h2 class="h2" id="ch10">WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">The federal workers' compensation program, administered under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, is designed to ensure that covered federal employees are protected from lost income and receive medical care after an on-the-job injury or occupational disease happens. The FECA program is complex to manage because it involves several departments and individuals, including HR, Occupational Health, and Safety. Teamwork and communication with the other players involved will help ensure that the process goes smoothly.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You have several workplace safety responsibilities, even before an employee is injured.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be aware of your work environment and how your employees function within that environment so you can prevent injuries before they happen.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If your agency has a safety department, consult with them about making the workplace as safe as it can be.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Ensure that every employee is trained fully and appropriately on the use of agency equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Your responsibilities continue even after an injury has occurred. You need to secure and authorize appropriate medical care and continuation of pay. Consult with your agency's HR staff if you have questions about medical care or COP.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Prevention of injuries</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Your employees are your most valuable asset and injury prevention programs can help protect them by decreasing workplace accidents and providing a safe environment for everyone. This can lead to higher productivity, reduced turnover, and greater employee satisfaction. The prevention of work-related injuries is important because it can cut workers' compensation costs and increase productivity. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the head of each agency must develop and support organized safety promotion to reduce accidents and injuries, encourage safe practices, and eliminate work hazards and health risks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After an employee is injured, analyze where the injury happened, why it happened, and remove any hazards that caused the injury. Taking these steps can prevent a similar injury from happening to another employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A safe workplace culture will translate to fewer injuries and workers' compensation claims. Consult with your agency's HR or safety office for strategies on improving the culture of safety. These strategies can require:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Establishing and enforcing safety policies and programs.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Buy-in from leadership and management, as well as responsibility and accountability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employee involvement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Workplace safety during a pandemic</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Before employees report back to the workplace during or after a pandemic, you must have it ready upon their arrival. Agencies will build safety plans for employees. Work with HR to ensure safety precautions are in place so that everyone can be productive while minimizing the risk of a possible infection. Here are some model principles to be included in a safety plan:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If employees are not feeling well, they should not enter the workplace. Temperature and symptom checks also may be utilized each day.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Encourage and enforce social distancing in offices, conference rooms, and other communal and work spaces.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Instruct on proper don, doff, and disposal of personal protective equipment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Instruct employees to wear a face mask that covers the nose and mouth. Consider adaptations and alternatives if employees are unable to wear a mask properly or cannot tolerate a mask. Note that reasonable accommodations will be made for individuals in accordance with EEOC guidance.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Place hand sanitizer stations and disinfectant wipes throughout the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Post educational materials, fact sheets, and instructional posters in common areas.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Stagger starting and departing times, lunch, and break periods to reduce density, minimize traffic volume in elevators, and avoid crowds during commuting.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Strongly discourage the use of other employees' phones, desks, offices, work tools, and equipment such as headsets. Shared tools and equipment must be disinfected by users anytime the equipment is used by or transferred to a new person.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Increase the physical space between employee workstations to comply with CDC guidelines.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Increase the physical space or partition the space between employees and the public.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Utilize video or teleconferencing whenever possible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Arrange to have common areas and surfaces disinfected regularly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Claimant requirements</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Let's start with the employee's requirements when filing a claim. The claimant is the person requesting compensation. The claimant must show sufficient cause for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs to proceed with processing and adjudicating a claim. The OWCP has an obligation to aid in this process by giving detailed instructions for developing the required evidence. The OWCP also has a responsibility to develop evidence, particularly when it is the type of information normally obtained from an employing agency or other government source. In all cases, the claimant must submit the essentials of a prima facie case. This simply means that the claimant must establish certain preliminary facts in order for the OWCP to process the claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee seeking compensation benefits for an injury must establish five basic requirements under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act for his claim to be deemed compensable:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. The claim meets statutory time requirements.</b> Written notice of an injury or death must be filed within 30 days after the occurrence of the injury or death. The OWCP generally accepts as a notice of injury or death any written document received by the employing agency or the OWCP which is signed by the claimant or someone acting on the claimant's behalf and which contains the name of the employee, the date and location of the injury or death, and the cause and nature of the injury, or the employment factors believed to be the cause.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An original claim for compensation for disability or death must be filed within three years after the occurrence of the injury or death under 5 USC 8122. If a claim is not filed within three years, compensation may still be allowed if:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Written notice of injury or death was given within 30 days as specified in 5 USC 8119; or</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The immediate superior had actual knowledge (including verbal notification) of the injury or death within 30 days after its occurrence. The knowledge or notification must be such as to put the immediate superior reasonably on notice of an on-the-job injury or death.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> In a case before the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board, a widow's claim was time-barred because it was filed more than three years after her husband's death. Also, there was evidence that the husband's supervisor had knowledge of his injury within 30 days, but the evidence did not establish that the supervisor's knowledge was such as to reasonably put him on notice that the husband's death might have been employment-related.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In occupational disease cases, the three-year time limit for filing a claim begins to run when the employee first becomes aware or reasonably should have been aware, of a possible relationship between their condition and their employment. In a case of latent disability, the time for filing a claim does not begin to run until the employee has a compensable disability and is aware, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware, of the causal relationship of the compensable disability to the employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> The evidence demonstrated that a Navy civil engineer was aware or should have been aware of the relationship of his hearing loss to his federal employment prior to the date of last exposure when he retired. Because he failed to file his claim within three years of his retirement date, the ECAB found that it was untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. The injured or deceased worker was a federal employee.</b> 20 CFR 10.5 defines a federal employee as:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A civil officer or employee in any branch of the government of the United States, including an officer or employee of an instrumentality wholly owned by the United States;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An individual rendering personal service to the United States similar to the service of a civil officer or employee of the United States, without pay or for nominal pay, when a statute authorizes the acceptance or use of the service or authorizes payment of travel or other expenses of the individual.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">By these definitions, an injury that occurs while an individual is packing to move to their duty station -- before they have begun performing any federal duties -- will not be compensable where they do not receive any compensation before the starting date and they are not reimbursed for their moving expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>3. The injury did, in fact, occur as the claimant alleges.</b> This element of the claim consists of two components, which must be considered together:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Whether the claimant actually experienced the accident, untoward event, or employment factor that is alleged to have occurred. This is a factual determination.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Whether a medical condition has been diagnosed in connection with this event. To make this determination, medical evidence is required.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">In establishing the first of these components, the employee's statement as to how the injury occurred is of great probative value and will stand unless refuted by strong or persuasive evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Be advised that harassment or discrimination in the workplace can also cause a compensable emotional condition, but the employee has to corroborate that the harassment or discrimination occurred as claimed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To establish fact of injury in an occupational disease claim, an employee must submit:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span>A factual statement identifying employment factors alleged to have caused or contributed to the presence or occurrence of the disease or condition;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span>Medical evidence establishing the presence or existence of the disease or condition for which compensation is claimed; and</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span>Medical evidence establishing that the diagnosed condition is causally related to the employment factors identified by the employee.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> A mail carrier filed a traumatic injury claim alleging that she felt numbness on her left side after she bent down to pick up a tray of mail. The postmaster related that the claimant provided different accounts of how she was injured and different dates of the incident. The OWCP denied the claim, finding that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the incident occurred as alleged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> An education specialist with the Department of Veterans Affairs claimed that he did not know what caused him to fall at work causing him a lower back injury. However, a coworker observed him throw water into the air and quickly lie down on the floor. The evidence in this case cast serious doubt on the claim's validity, and it was denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>4. The injury occurred in the performance of duty.</b> The phrase "while in the performance of duty" has been interpreted by the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board to be the equivalent of the commonly found prerequisite in workers' compensation law of arising out of and in the course of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Arising out of the employment encompasses not only the work setting but also a causal concept, the requirement being that an employment factor caused the injury; it must be related to the performance of day-to-day regular duties, to specially assigned duties, or to a requirement imposed by the employer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To occur in the course of employment, in general, an injury must occur:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> At a time when the employee may reasonably be said to be engaged in the employer's business;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> At a place where they may reasonably be expected to be in connection with the employment; and</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> While they were reasonably fulfilling the duties of their employment or engaged in something incidental thereto.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> An exhibits specialist for the Department of the Interior worked from her residence, which was located in an archeological park near the Grand Canyon. During a lunch break, she stepped outside and was bitten by a rattlesnake. The ECAB denied her claim. It noted that under her telework agreement, she was to work from half of a spare bedroom. "When she left that space to eat lunch and then walk outside for fresh air or to enjoy the scenery, she was no longer in the performance of duty under the agreement," the ECAB explained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> A firefighter with the Navy claimed that he was injured in the performance of duty while running sprints on the agency's premises as part of his physical fitness routine. He stated that the injury occurred at 7:15 a.m. His shift had ended at 7 a.m. The ECAB upheld the denial of the claim. There was no evidence that the agency derived a substantial direct benefit from the after-hours activity beyond the intangible value of improvement in employee health and morale that is common to all kinds of recreational activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> The claimant with the Department of the Treasury broke her right forearm and scraped her right knee and left arm during a recreational walk in recognition of the American Heart Association's National Start Walking Day. The walk took place on designated streets in the local community and not on the agency's premises. The ECAB found that she failed to show "any nexus between her employment and the walk." As a result, the injury did not occur in the performance of duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>5. The worker's disability or death was caused by the claimed injury.</b> The claimant has the burden of establishing by the weight of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that the condition for which compensation is sought is causally related to a specific employment incident or to specific conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Causal relationship is a medical issue, and the medical evidence generally required to establish causal relationship is rationalized medical opinion evidence. Rationalized medical opinion evidence is medical evidence that includes a physician's rationalized opinion on whether there is a causal relationship between the employee's diagnosed condition and the compensable employment factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The opinion of the physician must be based on a complete factual and medical background of the claimant, must be one of reasonable medical certainty, and must be supported by medical rationale explaining the nature of the relationship between the diagnosed condition and the specific employment factors identified by the claimant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> A city letter carrier filed a traumatic injury claim alleging that he was robbed at gunpoint while on his mail route and subsequently experienced occupational stress. The claimant did not submit a medical opinion stating that the incident caused the diagnosed anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The OWCP denied the claim.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Traumatic injury claims</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A traumatic injury is a wound or other condition of the body caused by external force, including stress or strain. The injury must be identifiable by the time and place of occurrence and part of the body affected. It must be caused by a specific event or incident or series of events or incidents within a single day or work shift.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Examples of traumatic injuries include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee falls out of their chair at work and injures their knee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee hurts their back while lifting something heavy, such as boxes of files.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee slips and falls and hits their head on the floor in the agency's bathroom while taking a short break.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Understanding the difference between a traumatic injury and an occupational disease is important because you may only authorize COP if an employee's disability results from a traumatic injury. In addition, you may need to counsel the injured employee regarding the appropriate forms to complete. A CA-1 form is used to report traumatic injuries. Many agencies use the Department of Labor's ECOMP system for employees to fill out and submit the CA-1 form electronically. Check with your workers' compensation specialist for more information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The CA-1 should be submitted to you as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from the date of injury. If the employee is incapacitated, this action may be taken by someone acting on their behalf, including a family member, union official, or representative. A manager may provide this notice as well.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a traumatic injury occurs, you should focus on the following concerns:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Authorize medical treatment.</b> Stop everything and attend to the employee's medical needs. If the injury is serious, try to accompany the injured worker to the nearest available medical care provider. When possible, issue a CA-16, Authorization for Examination and/or Treatment form, within four hours of the disability to assure payment for the medical care, provided the disability occurred within seven days of the date of injury.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Investigate the accident.</b> In too many cases, a claim of work-related injury is not fully or factually developed and documented. Failure to perform this fundamental duty impairs the employee's claim for benefits and exposes the employing agency to unnecessary costs. You are the first line of defense in reducing unnecessary costs. You have an obligation to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding a claim of work-related injury both to help the injured worker develop the facts of an injury and to ensure safety hazards are addressed in the workplace. The initial inquiry should include obtaining witness statements from coworkers and a written narrative of the situation at the time of the incident. This information is critical to the development of a physician's reasoned medical opinion as to the causal relationship between the employee's medical condition and factors of employment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Authorize continuation of pay for the injured worker.</b> A covered federal employee is entitled to immediate COP, if injured as a result of any factors of employment. There are only a few reasons for an employing agency to refuse to authorize COP. If the claim of injury does not meet one of the specified conditions listed under the section entitled "Continuation of Pay" in this chapter, the employing agency must authorize COP for up to 45 calendar days.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Communicate with the injured worker.</b> Employees are entitled to be fully advised of all rights, benefits, and obligations under the federal workers' compensation program. Those are:</li>
</ul>
<ol class="num-ri">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Employees have the right to choose their treating physician.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Employees are entitled to COP for up to 45 calendar days if they meet all of the eligibility requirements.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Employees are entitled to medical care and compensation for as long as disability exists that is causally related to factors of employment.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Employees must prove through reliable medical evidence that the claimed medical condition and disability was caused, aggravated, or adversely affected by their federal employment. This is a much higher standard of medical evidence required than simply a note from the doctor saying "off work six weeks."</li>
<li><span class="num-r">5.</span> Employees must provide objective medical evidence that supports their claimed disability within 10 calendar days from the date of injury. Otherwise, COP may be terminated until the claim is adjudicated by the OWCP.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">6.</span> Employees must provide the employing agency with any physical restrictions imposed by the attending physician.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">7.</span> Employees must provide the attending physician with any offer of light duty made by the employing agency and return the physician's evaluation of the light-duty offer to the employing agency immediately.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">8.</span> Employees must accept any offer of light duty that meets the physical restrictions imposed by the attending physician.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3">Occupational disease claims</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An occupational disease is defined as a condition produced by the work environment over a period longer than a single workday or shift. Examples of occupational diseases include carpal tunnel syndrome, hearing loss, and back pain that is not traceable to a distinct work incident.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several significant differences exist between occupational disease claims and traumatic injury claims:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Continuation of pay is not authorized for claims of occupational disease. COP applies only to traumatic, disabling injuries the employee reports on an Office of Workers' Compensation claim form within 30 days. COP is never authorized for occupational disease claims.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Medical care is not authorized for claims of occupational disease without prior approval from the OWCP. Unlike the procedure for traumatic injuries, a CA-16, Authorization for Examination and/or Treatment, is not to be issued in cases of occupational disease without OWCP approval.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Substantial additional documentation is required for claims of occupational disease. OWCP regulations require that additional information be gathered and provided by the claimant, the employing agency, and the physician. Instructions accompanying the checklists explain to the claimant that they are not automatically covered by workers' compensation and that factual and medical evidence is required to establish a causal relationship between factors of employment and the medical condition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">As with traumatic injury cases, in claims involving occupational conditions or diseases, employees are entitled to be fully advised of all rights, benefits, and obligations under the federal workers' compensation program, which include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees are not entitled to COP. They must use annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay to cover any absence from duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If the OWCP accepts the occupational disease claim, employees are entitled to medical care and compensation for as long as disability exists that is causally related to factors of employment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> As in traumatic injury claims, employees must prove through reliable medical evidence that the claimed medical condition and disability was caused, aggravated, or adversely affected by their federal employment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee must provide objective medical evidence to support periods of disability, including the time spent away from work, before the claim is accepted by the OWCP.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">All medical evidence to support the claim is obtained at the employee's own expense. Should the OWCP accept the claim, those expenses will be reimbursed by the OWCP.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Exposure to infectious disease</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">If one of your employees has a claim for an injury due to exposure to an infectious disease, the claim can be filed either as a traumatic injury claim (using Form CA-1) or as an occupational disease claim (using Form CA-2). A traumatic injury claim involves a specific event or series of events within a single workday or shift. For example, an employee may claim that they were stuck with a needle in the course of their employment and contracted hepatitis as the result of the needlestick injury. An occupational disease or illness, on the other hand, refers to a condition produced by the work environment over a period longer than a single workday or shift.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's mere exposure to an infectious disease will not generate compensation. Neither will the employee's fear of contracting the disease. Exposure to an infectious disease alone is not enough to establish a personal physical injury. The employee must have contracted the disease to which they were exposed at work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To support the claim, the employee must submit all of the following:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Medical evidence establishing the presence or existence of the disease or condition.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A factual statement identifying employment factors alleged to have caused or contributed to the presence or occurrence of the disease or condition.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Medical evidence establishing that the diagnosed condition is causally related to the employment factors identified by the employee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Exposure to coronavirus disease</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Due to developments in the law, workers' compensation claims are treated differently depending on the date of the COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the American Rescue Plan Act, employees who are diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan. 27, 2020, to Jan. 27, 2023, and work in jobs that require contact with patients, members of the public, or coworkers are deemed to have an injury caused by exposure to the coronavirus in the performance of duty. These employees are entitled to disability compensation, medical services, and survivor benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Claims for COVID-19 diagnosed after Jan. 27, 2023, must establish the five basic elements for adjudication set forth in the FECA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>COVID-19 diagnosis until Jan. 27, 2023.</b> If one of your employees believes they have contracted coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a result of a work-related exposure, they should complete Form CA-1. Their filing of a CA-1 will not prevent them from later filing a CA-2 nor will it prevent OWCP from subsequently adjusting the nature of the claim from traumatic to occupational disease, if circumstances warrant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee should submit factual evidence concerning exposure as well as supporting medical evidence. Your agency will be expected to provide OWCP with any information it has concerning the alleged exposure and to indicate whether it is supporting or controverting the claim. If the agency supports the claim (including that the exposure occurred) and the CA-1 is filed within 30 days, the employee is eligible to receive Continuation of Pay for up to 45 days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OWCP will then develop the claim and review evidence provided by the employee and your agency concerning work-related exposure and a COVID-19 diagnosis. Should the claim be accepted for COVID-19, the injured worker is entitled to receive all medical services, appliances or supplies which a qualified physician prescribes or recommends, and which OWCP considers necessary to treat the work-related injury.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>COVID-19 diagnosis after Jan. 27, 2023.</b> If one of your employees believes they contracted COVID-19 as a result of a work-related exposure, they should generally file a Form CA-2. This is because in most cases there is no clear, identifiable incident or incidents over a single day or work shift to which the injured worker can specifically attribute the event alleged to have caused the diagnosed COVID-19. While OWCP had previously required these claims to be filed on Form CA-1, that was due to the exigent circumstances and uncertainty regarding COVID-19. The change was made so that COVID-19 is treated similarly to other airborne infectious disease claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Form CA-1 may be used only if the event alleged to have caused the diagnosed COVID-19 is identifiable as to time and place of occurrence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For claims for COVID-19 diagnosed after Jan. 27, 2023, the claimant must establish the five basic elements under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act for the claim to be deemed compensable:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The claim was filed within the time limits set by the FECA.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The injured worker was a federal employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span>The claimant provided evidence of a diagnosis of COVID-19, and that establishes they actually experienced the event or employment factor alleged to have occurred.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The alleged event or employment factor occurred while the employee was in the performance of duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The COVID-19 is found by a physician to be caused by the established event or employment factor.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Employees impacted by the COVID-19 vaccination mandate who receive required COVID-19 vaccinations on or after the date of President Biden's Executive Order 14043 (Sept. 9, 2021) can be entitled to coverage under the FECA for any adverse reactions to the vaccine. FECA coverage can also include injuries sustained while obtaining the vaccination, such as accidents while commuting to and from the vaccination site and slip and fall injuries occurring at the vaccination site. Because a vaccination is a specific event occurring on a single workday or shift, a claim for an adverse reaction or injury is a traumatic injury claim and should be filed on a Form CA-1.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Reinfection.</b> A claim for COVID-19 will be considered a new injury when the employee tests positive for COVID-19 90 days or more from the date of the employee's previous positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Emotional conditions</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A disability resulting from an emotional reaction to regular or specially assigned work duties or to a work requirement is covered by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If one of your employees has a claim for an emotional condition, the claim can be filed either as a traumatic injury claim (using Form CA-1) or an as occupational disease claim (using Form CA-2). A traumatic injury claim involves a specific event or series of events within a single workday or shift. For example, an employee may claim that they experienced an emotional condition due to a stressful work incident. An occupational disease or illness refers to a condition produced by the work environment over a period longer than a single workday or shift. An example of an occupational disease can include stress caused by a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To establish a claim for an emotional condition, an employee must submit the following:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Medical evidence establishing that they have an emotional or psychiatric disorder;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Factual evidence identifying employment factors or incidents alleged to have caused or contributed to their condition; and</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Medical evidence establishing that the identified compensable employment factors are causally related to their emotional condition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Note that workers' compensation law does not apply to every injury or illness that is somehow related to an employee's employment. There are situations where an injury or an illness has some connection with the employment but nevertheless does not come within FECA coverage. Here are some examples of situations where an emotional condition is not compensable:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee's reaction to an unsatisfactory performance rating, performance assessment, or informal discussion of performance, absent any evidence of error or abuse by the employing establishment, is considered self-generated and therefore not compensable.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee's disabling emotional reaction due to a fear of losing their job and a fear of losing a particular position is not covered.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A disability is not covered where it results from an employee's frustration from not being permitted to work in a particular environment or to hold a particular position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Error or abuse.</b> An employee's emotional reaction to an administrative or personnel matter can be covered under the FECA when the evidence discloses error or abuse on the part of the employing agency. The ECAB considers whether the agency acted reasonably.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are some examples of error or abuse:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee and her supervisor engaged in a heated argument about a leave request. The supervisor placed the request on the employee's head because she refused to accept it, and the supervisor was arrested for disorderly conduct. The ECAB found the physical contact by the supervisor constituted error or abuse.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee claimed an emotional condition when the employing agency issued a letter of warning. A dispute resolution team found that the employing agency did not have just cause to issue the letter of warning, and it rescinded the letter. Therefore, the ECAB found that management committed error or abuse.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A Merit Systems Protection Board decision established that the agency committed error or abuse in suspending and removing the claimant.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Harassment and discrimination.</b> For harassment or discrimination to give rise to a compensable disability under the FECA, there must be evidence that harassment or discrimination did, in fact, occur. The employee must provide evidence supporting their claims of harassment or discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In evaluating workers' compensation claims, the term "harassment" is not equivalent to "harassment" as defined by the EEOC. Under the FECA, the term "harassment" is synonymous with a "persistent disturbance, torment, or persecution, i.e., mistreatment by employees or coworkers."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee might claim an emotional condition as a result of a verbal altercation with a coworker. There may be coverage under the FECA when "friction and strain" arise as part of the work conditions or the employment brings employees together and creates the conditions that result in the altercation. Even when the coworker's conduct does not rise to the level of a hostile work environment to justify removal, the incident can create a compensable employment factor. As with physical assaults, when the subject matter of a verbal altercation is imported into the employment from an employee's private life and the work did not contribute to the dispute, the dispute is not a compensable factor of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Remember:</b> You should work with workers' compensation and HR specialists who deal with these matters regularly because they are well-versed in what the law and regulations require. Don't be afraid to rely on their expertise to help you through the process.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Continuation of pay</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees are entitled to receive COP when they are absent from work because of disability or medical treatment, or when they are formally reassigned to a position with a lower rate of pay due to partial disability. Agencies may controvert an employee's entitlement to COP for several reasons. Those reasons are:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The disability was caused by an occupational disease or illness rather than by a traumatic injury.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is not a citizen of the United States or Canada.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> No written claim was filed within 30 days from the date of injury.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The injury was not reported until after employment had been terminated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The injury occurred off the employing agency's premises and was otherwise not within the performance of official duties.</li>

<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Work did not stop until more than 45 days following the injury.</li>

<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Workers' compensation claims can be very tricky for managers to deal with. You should always consult a workers' compensation specialist.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Authorize COP for occupational disease claims.</b> COP applies only to traumatic and disabling injuries reported on an OWCP claim form within 30 days. COP is never authorized for occupational disease claims.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to ask the employee for appropriate medical documentation.</b> There is a great distinction between the level of medical evidence needed to support a workers' compensation claim of injury or illness, and the much lower level required to request sick leave. A simple slip of paper from a physician stating that the employee is "off work" is insufficient for a benefits claim or COP.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Refuse or fail to offer light or alternate duty.</b> This is the single biggest factor in soaring workers' compensation program costs. An employing agency has a vested interest in an injured employee's return to duty as soon as medically feasible. The most effective method to reduce unnecessary costs is to establish a policy of accommodating all work-related injuries whenever possible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Call the employee's doctor's office.</b> Although you are entitled to obtain detailed medical documentation of the worker's current condition so that you can make an informed decision about returning him to work, you may only contact the physician in writing. Talk to your HR office if you're unsure how to get the necessary information.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to properly investigate.</b> Look into the circumstances surrounding an accident. Interview witnesses. Talk to the injured employee about how the injury occurred, what they were doing before it happened, who was around to see it happen, and so forth. Write everything down. A thorough investigation helps develop the facts of an injury and ensures that safety hazards are addressed in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Why should I care about the costs of workers' comp? It falls on the government as a whole, not my agency, right?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Wrong. Through the chargeback mechanism, your agency budget is directly burdened with the entire cost of workers' comp for your employees. This takes away funds that could be used for other personnel needs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is continuation of pay and how does it work?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The law authorizes employing agencies to continue an employee's pay for up to 45 calendar days of disability, while the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs considers the employee's claim for compensation. Continuation of pay, or COP, applies only when the employee has suffered a traumatic, disabling injury and has reported his injury on an OWCP claim form within 30 days. The agency, not OWCP, pays COP. Unlike wage-loss benefits, COP is subject to taxes and all other payroll deductions that are made from regular income.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may challenge or "controvert" an employee's entitlement to COP for a number of reasons, including when the employee's disability was not caused by a traumatic injury.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are teleworkers entitled to workers' compensation benefits?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Generally speaking, as long as teleworkers are performing work-related tasks within their telework space when the injury occurs, it will be covered by workers' compensation. If you have questions about whether a particular telework-related injury is covered, however, it's always advisable to consult your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. One of my employees said she slipped on spilled coffee, fell down some stairs, and struck her head while on duty. Since there were no witnesses, will her claim of a traumatic injury be denied?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Not necessarily. An injury does not have to be confirmed by witnesses to establish the fact that an employee sustained an injury in the performance of duty, according to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board. However, the employee's statements must be consistent with the surrounding facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If I'm unsure about whether I can return an injured worker to work in his former position, can I call the treating doctor?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Although you are entitled to obtain detailed medical documentation of the worker's current condition so that you can make an informed decision about returning him to work, you may only contact the physician in writing. If your agency has a medical officer, you may want to ask that person for assistance. It's also a good idea to check with your workers' compensation specialist or HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How much time do I have to complete Form CA-16, Authorization for Examination and/or Treatment?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Within four hours of the request whenever possible. If you have doubts about whether the employee's condition is related to the employment, you should indicate that on the form. When in doubt, consult with your HR office or workers' compensation specialist. Where there is no time to complete a CA-16 form, you may authorize medical treatment by telephone and send the completed form to the medical facility within 48 hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. An employee suffered an injury at their home, which was his official duty station, on a Saturday while working a maxiflex schedule, and while performing their normal duties. Would he be entitled to workers' compensation benefits?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. If the circumstances show that the injury occurred during the performance of duty and sufficient medical evidence is presented, then the employee can be covered under workers' compensation.</p>
