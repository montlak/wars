<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-121"><span class="space">7.</span> Medical Expenses</h4>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is entitled to pecuniary damages for medical treatments that she had to pay for due to an agency's discrimination. Of course, the complainant must establish a nexus between the harm and the agency's <span id="Page_1820"></span>discriminatory actions. In <span class="italic">Tien E. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2020001343 (2021), the Commission increased an agency's $2,451.30 award for medical expenses incurred by the complainant to $865,027.63. The complainant alleged that the agency subjected her to discrimination based on her disability when it unreasonably delayed approving her request for telework. As a consequence, the complainant suffered a "nearly fatal pulmonary respiratory attack." The Commission relied on medical records and doctor's opinions to find nexus and calculate an award in <span class="italic">Tien E</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a claim for pecuniary compensatory damages, a complainant must demonstrate, through appropriate evidence and documentation, the harm suffered because of the agency's discriminatory action. Damages for past pecuniary damages will not normally be sought without documentation such as receipts, records, bills, cancelled checks, or confirmation by other individuals of actual loss and expenses. Compensatory and Punitive Damages available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992) (available at www.eeoc.gov.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested in her initial statement of damages $1,069,703.75 in medical expenses. The Agency, however, only granted her a fraction of the amount: $2,451.30. The Agency justified the small award by stating, while the work facility was said to be the cause of her conditions, Complainant was exposed to the environment before Complainant requested telework. So, the Agency asserted that the discriminatory action (i.e. the delay in providing telework as a reasonable accommodation) was not the cause of Complainant's illnesses. Further, the Agency reasoned that Complainant's evidence did not show the delay in approving telework exacerbated her conditions to the extent that it was a proximate cause of her April 20, 2014 hospitalization. Complainant was not hospitalized during the delay. Therefore, in the Agency's view, its responsibility was limited to damages incurred between December 11, 2013 and March 5, 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the instant record, however, shows otherwise. Complainant's primary care physician, "Doctor-H," established a nexus between the Agency's delay in providing Complainant a reasonable accommodation and the "near fatal pulmonary respiratory attack" and resulting hospitalization. Doctor-H treated Complainant well before and after her hospital confinement, and attested that before November 22, 2013, Complainant did not have asthma nor any other pulmonary, cardiac, kidney or diabetic conditions. Complainant's nasal and respiratory complaints led Doctor-H to refer Complainant to an allergy and asthma specialist, who diagnosed her with asthmatic bronchitis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The diagnosis, in conjunction with reports of mold findings and environmental hazards in her workplace, caused Doctor-H to conclude Complainant was experiencing "sick-building syndrome." Doctor-H plainly attested: "My concern for her work environment was confirmed when she was transported to the hospital with the nearly fatal pulmonary attack of respiratory failure restricting her breathing and other serious conditions such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus, aureus pneumonia, and sepsis which can lead to organ failure and death." He explained further that Complainant "had complications of dysfunctional kidneys, cardiac fibrillation, and diabetes...." Complainant was admitted, by ambulance, to Piedmont Newnan Hospital on April 20, 2014. Complainant was in a coma and experienced organ deficits. After three days, she was transferred via helicopter to Piedmont Atlanta Hospital for further intensive care, including being placement on a respirator and dialysis. On June 3, 2014, Complainant was moved from the hospital to Warm Springs Medical Center for a three-week stay and then to Warm Springs Rehabilitation and Medical Specialty Hospital until her discharge on July 29, 2014. Doctor-H plainly stated: "In my professional opinion, I am reasonably certain that her near fatal pulmonary attack on April 20, 2014, and the complications arising from the attack were caused by the sick building environment to which she had been assigned before being granted telework in March 2014...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that such serious injury would likely not have occurred had the Agency granted Complainant's reasonable accommodation request three months earlier. The parties acknowledge that workplace environmental factors caused Complainant to develop asthmatic bronchitis and the record shows that the Agency's delay in providing telework as a reasonable accommodation exacerbated her respiratory conditions and proximately produced other physical ailments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yet, the Agency would have us believe that in the three weeks between her initial diagnosis and request for telework Complainant developed serious conditions, admittedly caused by her workplace, that did not progress or worsen during months of continued exposure (during the Agency's delay in granting telework). Further, the Agency asserted that any such exacerbation ceased and was unrelated to her near fatal attack in April 2014, because she was teleworking in the immediately preceding weeks. We find the Agency's arguments to be speculative and unsupported by evidence. The statement by Doctor-H establishes that Complainant's pulmonary attack, albeit occurring after telework was granted, was the consequence of additional exposure during the denied telework period. Therefore, Complainant is entitled to past pecuniary damages that encompass the April 20, 2014 medical emergency and accompanying hospitalizations and treatments. <span class="italic">See Carpenter v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the documentation provided by Complainant in support of her request for pecuniary damages. The record includes receipts for the following:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The above-cited charges show what was charged by the service provider, not reduced amounts reflecting payment by insurance. The Commission has previously held that a federal Agency is required to pay a Complainant's medical bills without regard to whether health insurance paid for any part of the medical bills. <span class="italic">Clark v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092454 (Dec. 20, 2010); <span class="italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995); <span class="italic">Yonker v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A05979 (Jan. 9, 2001) (Complainant is entitled, pursuant to the collateral source rule, to the full amount of the pecuniary damages, even if some, or all, of the expenses were paid by her health insurance). Under the collateral source rule, an agency may not reduce its liability for damages because of payments made to a complainant from a collateral source. Complainant is required only to prove that she incurred the expenses to establish her entitlement to a corresponding damage award. She need not make the additional showing that she paid the expense. The Commission has consistently applied the collateral source rule in determining damages for over 20 years. <span class="italic">See Woodrow B. v. Dep't of Health and Human Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120143194 (May 13, 2016). Therefore, we find that Complainant is entitled to all the charges listed above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, Complainant has submitted BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS) Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements ranging in dates of service from November 22, 2013 through December 28, 2018. The majority of EOB statements are from July through December 2014. The statement for December 17, 2014 services reflects that Complainant had paid $5,235.00 of the $5,500 annual maximum "out-of-pocket" expenses for that calendar year. Although, as noted above, Complainant is entitled to the expenses charged for the medical services and not simply the amount she personally expended after insurance payments, we find she has not provided sufficient documentation for the medical expenses incurred after being discharged from Piedmont Atlanta Hospital. We shall award her the $5,235.00 in "out-of-pocket" costs she was responsible for in 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In seeking pecuniary damages for 2015 through 2018, Complainant submits a handful of EOB statements for each year and notes that at the end of each calendar year she had met the $5,500 maximum for out-of-pocket expenses. We find the submission of random EOB statements, simply identifying "Medical Care," for the three-year period following her pulmonary attack insufficient to support an award of additional pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Complainant's March 10, 2019 supplemental request for compensatory damages, she requests an additional $19,369.90 in pecuniary damages. According to Complainant, she incurred $11,666.88 in 2018. In support, Complainant's attorney provides a list, with the date of treatment, the provider's name, and the amount purportedly charged. A similar list is proffered to support the request for $5,213.00 for 2019 medical expenses. Approximately $2,500 in drug expenses is also sought for the two-year period. The Commission finds that Complainant, seeking pecuniary damages for medical expenses occurring four and five years after she was denied a reasonable accommodation, has not provided adequate evidence of a nexus between these medical costs and the Agency's discrimination. In fact, there is little evidence of what precisely these charges were for. There are no affidavits from the treating physicians nor receipts describing the services provided, only a list from Complainant's attorney and a year-end printout from BCBS. Consequently, we decline to grant Complainant's request for 2018 and 2019 medical expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has established entitlement to $865,027.63 in pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1821"></span>But, a complainant is not entitled to an award of pecuniary damages for medical treatments she could not afford because of her unlawful termination. <span class="Italic">See Gause, supra</span>. Moreover, merely submitting insurance forms that reflect treatment and payment are insufficient to establish the requisite causal connection between the harm and the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Winston v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01972099 (2000). The forms contained no diagnosis or explanation of why the medical treatments were necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is entitled to pecuniary damages for visits made to a psychiatrist to support a damage claim. <span class="Italic">Grice v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01976646 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bull v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A12574 (2002), the Commission awarded $24,369 for a new prothesis for the complainant when her emotional distress led to weight loss requiring the new prothesis.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Jeffry R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020002824 (2021), the Commission found that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, which led to his "inability to perform the duties of his position and the reduction/elimination of his work hours." The Commission ordered the agency to assess and award damages. On appeal, the complainant alleged that the pecuniary damages award was deficient because it did not include reimbursements for certain costs incurred because of the "ripple effects of unemployment." The Commission agreed with the agency that the complainant failed to establish a nexus between the agency's actions and certain expenses in <span class="italic">Jeffry R</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the costs associated with the use of ambulance/emergency room care provided for the heatstroke suffered by Complainant in July 2019, we reject these expenses. While we understand that Complainant relates his heatstroke to the ripple effects of unemployment (i.e., his need for additional income to pay off his debts), we nevertheless agree with the Agency that the casual link between Complainant working as an Uber driver and the discrimination suffered years earlier is extremely attenuated. For this reason, we shall deny this request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the same vein, we also find Complainant's arguments for future psychotherapy costs ($14,400.00) to be unpersuasive. Although Complainant may subjectively believe that he needs psychotherapy sessions twice a month, at $150.00 per session, for the next four years, the record does not contain objective evidence establishing such a need. As such, we are disinclined to grant this request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to Complainant's request for reimbursement of $77,269.63 in credit card debts and interest fees, which he relates to the ripple effects of unemployment. Complainant maintains that his financial status was excellent prior to the Agency's discriminatory actions, noting a bank balance of over $71,000. Due to the Agency's refusal to allow him to work, argues Complainant, he incurred massive debt. But for the discrimination, Complainant contends that he would not have incurred these debts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, including Exhibit 12, we find that Complainant has not shown how these debts were causally related to the discrimination. While Complainant relates the entire $77,269.63 balance to the "ripple effects of unemployment," he must still provide objective evidence of actual out-of-pocket expenses and the reasons for such expenditures. Complainant has not met his burden to do so. Consequently, we shall not grant Complainant $77,269.63 for credit card debts and interest fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In seeking reimbursement for bank overdraft fees (incurred between December 2017 and October 2019) and tax debt (billed in 2019, regarding tax year 2016), Complainant again asserts they are tied to the "ripple effects of unemployment" cause by the Agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant reasons that the overdraft fees were the result of financial strain caused by the Agency's refusal to allow him to work. The strain on his finances resulted in tax debt, as he used "every cent" of his Uber earnings to service his debts, leaving no funds to pay his tax obligations. While we sympathize with Complainant's circumstances, we nevertheless agree with the Agency that there is not a sufficient causal link between these debts and the discrimination. We note, for example, that Complainant first incurred an overdraft fee on December 22, 2017, approximately two years and eight months after he returned to work. Moreover, the record shows that Complainant incurred the tax debt in 2016, after he had already returned to work. The record does not demonstrate that the Agency's discriminatory actions are the "but for" proximate cause of Complainant's overdraft and tax debts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that on October 7, 2014, he had to withdraw $30,000 from his TSP as a source of funding. As a result, Complainant argues he lost an estimated $16,000.00 in profits between October 7, 2014 to April 28, 2017. On appeal, Complaint seeks an additional $18,000.00 to reflect market changes since his last estimate. In total, Complainant seeks $34,000.00 "for investment loss as a result of taking out a loan taken as a result of Complainant's unemployment caused by the Agency's discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, Complainant believes he is entitled to $15,790.42 in lost profits and dividends related to his private stock investments, which he was allegedly forced to sell due to his lost work income. Complainant challenges the Agency's assertion that the losses were due to the speculative nature of the stock market, pointing to "actual data" regarding current-day share prices compared to the prices when the stocks were sold.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission declines to award Complainant the costs associated with such losses. Complainant has failed to prove that he took out a TSP loan because of the Agency's discriminatory actions. Moreover, even assuming <span class="italic">arguendo</span> that Complainant could make that showing, we share the Agency's confusion as to how Complainant calculated a gain of 60 percent from October 7, 2014 to April 28, 2017, as well as the alleged additional gain ($18,000) from that period to the date of the instant appeal. Complainant's speculative, unsupported request is rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we find that Complainant failed to persuasively show he was forced to sell his private investments because of the discrimination. Exhibit 14 includes two tables reflecting Complainant's calculations regarding the alleged losses, as well as a list of the stocks allegedly sold to meet his financial needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What is missing, however, is objective evidence that Complainant in fact owned and sold these stocks. The record contains no evidence of such stock transactions. More importantly, Complainant has not proffered persuasive evidence that these stock sales were made because of the discrimination he suffered.</p>
