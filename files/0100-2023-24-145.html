<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-125"><span class="space">19.</span> Never Qualified for Position Held</h4>
<p class="noindent">Agencies are not obligated to reassign an employee who never qualified for the position for which he or she was hired. The Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship</span> under the ADA, No. 915.002 (October 17, 2002), explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee with a disability is eligible for reassignment to a new position, regardless of whether s/he is considered "probationary," as long as the employee adequately performed the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation, before the need for a reassignment arose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The longer the period of time in which an employee has adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, the more likely it is that reassignment is appropriate if the employee becomes unable to continue performing the essential functions of the current position due to a disability. If, however, the probationary employee has never adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, then s/he is not entitled to reassignment because s/he was never "qualified" for the original position. In this situation, the employee is similar to an applicant who applies for a job for which s/he is not qualified, and then requests reassignment. Applicants are not entitled to reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example A:&#x2003;An employer designates all new employees as "probationary" for one year. An employee has been working successfully for nine months when she becomes disabled in a car accident. The employee, due to her disability, is unable to continue performing the essential functions of her current position, with or without reasonable accommodation, and seeks a reassignment. She is entitled to a reassignment if there is a vacant position for which she is qualified and it would not pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example B:&#x2003;A probationary employee has been working two weeks, but has been unable to perform the essential functions of the job because of his disability. There are no reasonable accommodations that would permit the individual to perform the essential functions of the position, so the individual requests a reassignment. The employer does not have to provide a reassignment (even if there is a vacant position) because, as it turns out, the individual was never qualified--i.e., the individual was never able to perform the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation, for which he was hired.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Shelley v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070076 (2012), for instance, relied on its Enforcement Guidance to find that the complainant, a probationary employee, could not establish that he entitled to a reassignment because he could not show that he could perform the essential functions of his position for which he was originally hired:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the AJ found that Complainant was an individual with a disability and that he was not afforded a reasonable accommodation. However, the AJ did not address whether Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability, finding that whether Complainant could perform the essential functions of his position "was not discussed" due to the Agency's failure to initiate the interactive process. "[L]iability nevertheless depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the [individual with a disability] to perform the job's essential functions." <span class="Italic">Barnard v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A10002 (Aug. 2, 2002) (citations omitted). Therefore, we find that the AJ committed an error of law by finding that Complainant was denied an accommodation and terminated in violation of the Rehabilitation Act without first determining whether he was a qualified individual with a disability covered under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that Complainant was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, we note that a qualified individual with a disability is defined as an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Struthers v. Dep't. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40043 (June 29, 2006) (complainant has the threshold burden of establishing that she is a qualified individual with a disability).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that Complainant failed to establish that he was a qualified individual with a disability. The record reflects that Complainant's Mailhandler position required him to perform numerous duties that required him to regularly stand or walk, including, but not limited to, walking between machines, lifting sacks of mail, and loading and unloading containers of mail. Complainant testified at the hearing that his duties included "[s]tanding, walking from machine to machine, unloading full bags and replacing them with empties and moving mail containers where they needed to go." However, Complainant had a permanent medical restriction during the relevant time period limiting him to one hour of standing, walking, or climbing while at work. Complainant has not shown that he could perform the essential functions of his position with or without accommodation for his restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a probationary employee such as Complainant may not be denied reassignment as a reasonable accommodation solely on the basis of probationary status, the probationary employee nonetheless must have established that he is a "qualified individual with a disability." <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002), Q. 25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's enforcement guidance on reasonable accommodation addresses this situation, noting that "an employee with a disability is eligible for reassignment to a new position, regardless of whether s/he is considered 'probationary,' as long as the employee adequately performed the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation, before the need for a reassignment arose." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While there is no bright-line test to determine how long the employee must perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation to be eligible for reassignment, "the longer the period of time in which an employee has adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, the more likely it is that reassignment is appropriate if the employee becomes unable to continue performing the essential functions of the current position due to a disability." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guidance continues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If, however, the probationary employee has never adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, then s/he is not entitled to reassignment because s/he was never "qualified" for the original position. In this situation, the employee is similar to an applicant who applies for a job for which s/he is not qualified, and then requests reassignment. Applicants are not entitled to reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant worked for the Agency for only seven days before stopping work on account of his disabling condition. There is no reasonable accommodation that would enable Complainant to perform the essential functions of the Mailhandler position. Under the circumstances, Complainant is not eligible for reassignment, because he was never qualified for the position for which he was hired, i.e., there is no reasonable accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of the Mailhandler position. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at Ex. B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant has not demonstrated that he could perform the essential functions of the position for which he was hired, we find that has not established that he is a qualified individual with a disability. Accordingly, we find that the AJ erred in finding that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, and we AFFIRM the Agency's final order declining to implement the AJ's decision finding discrimination and awarding remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached the same conclusion in <span class="Italic">Bruce P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120182117 (2020). The complainant in that case was employed with the agency for more than two years as an Emergency Management Specialist before being terminated. Emergency Management Specialists had to be able to be deployed to disaster areas, but upon being hired, the complainant immediately sought a delay in deployment. So ensued two years of discussions, doctor's notes, and offers of reassignment declined by the complainant. The Commission agreed with the agency that the complainant could not perform the essential functions of the job and was not entitled reassignment in <span class="Italic">Bruce P</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant requested a reasonable accommodation when <span id="Page_1392"></span>he presented restrictions from the Physician indicating that Complainant was diagnosed with PTSD with psychogenic seizures and depression. We note that the Agency found that Complainant established that he is an individual with a disability covered by the Rehabilitation Act in its final decision. We discern no basis to reject the Agency's finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency found that Complainant clearly could not perform the essential function of his position, namely deployment. We note that Complainant was hired by the Agency for his position as an Emergency Management Specialist. This is a position which requires travel up to 300 days a year. Complainant did not establish that he was a qualified individual with a disability. There is no reasonable accommodation that would enable Complainant to perform the essential function of deployment or travel for the Emergency Management Specialist position. Under these circumstances, Complainant cannot perform the essential function of the position for which he was hired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Complainant is not eligible for reassignment because he was never qualified for the position for which he was hired. <span class="Italic">See Shelley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070076 (June 14, 2012) (finding that the complainant, a probationary employee, was unable to establish that he was qualified or entitled to a reassignment because he could not establish that he could perform the essential functions of his position for which he was hired after he was hospitalized due to a medical condition after working for the agency for several days.) Here, because Complainant has not demonstrated that he could perform the essential functions of the position for which he was hired, we find that he has not established that he is a qualified individual with a disability entitled to a reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we determine that Complainant has not established that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when the it failed to provide him with a reassignment. We noted above that Complainant's claims of harassment and disparate treatment were related to his claim that the Agency failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. Based on our determination that Complainant was not subjected to discrimination regarding the Agency's denial of reasonable accommodation, we similarly cannot find that Complainant was subjected to discriminatory disparate treatment or harassment in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">It's worth noting that <span class="Italic">Bruce P</span>. did not indicate that the complainant was a probationary employee. Even though the Enforcement Guidance speaks specifically to probationary employees, there is no reason that the rule should only apply to probationary employees as long as it can be shown that the employee was never able to perform the essential functions of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Shon T. v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 2020000125 (2020), the agency established that the employee never adequately performed the essential functions of the position and not entitled to reassignment was a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Shon T</span>. was hired as a patent examiner at the PTO. As a child, he suffered a traumatic brain injury that affected his ability to walk, speak and write. Shon T. worked for the agency from August 2016 to July 2018 when he was terminated for failure to meet the requirements of the job. In support of the termination, the agency pointed to failing performance evaluations and attempts at reasonably accommodating the complainant in his original position in <span class="Italic">Shon T</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">RA Program Manager explained that Complainant's medical provider indicated that Complainant's impairments limited his ability to meet the stringent time parameters required of a patent examiner and stated that there was no accommodation that would allow Complainant to perform the essential functions of his current job as a patent examiner, due to the permanency of Complainant's condition and his resulting limitations. Additionally, as noted above, Complainant, as a probationary employee, was subject to periodic performance assessments and his progress was noted as failing to meet expectations beginning around the sixth month. Complainant's Performance Summary and Rating dated October 24, 2017, shows that his overall performance rating was "marginal." In total, Complainant's performance assessments suggest that he was able to perform some of basic job functions during the early months of his training period, but as expectations increased during the training process, he was unable to adequately perform the essential functions of the patent examiner position. Therefore, in light of Complainant's medical provider's reported statement that there was no accommodation that would allow Complainant to perform the essential functions of his current job as a patent examiner because of his limitations and Complainant's performance record indicating that he failed to meet performance standards, we find the record sufficiently establishes that Complainant never adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, and, therefore, was never "qualified" for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the discussion of "qualified" does not end at Complainant's position of record. The term "qualified individual with a disability," with respect to employment, is defined as a person with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "position" is not limited to the position currently held by the employee, but may also include positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. Therefore, in determining whether an employee is "qualified," an agency may have to look beyond the position which the employee presently encumbers. Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix, to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630.2(o).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers cannot deny a reassignment to an employee solely because he is designated as "probationary." <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Notice No. 915.002, Q. 25 (Oct. 17, 2002). An employee with a disability is eligible for reassignment to a new position, regardless of whether he is considered "probationary," as long as the employee adequately performed the essential functions of the position, with or without accommodation, before the need for a reassignment arose. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no "bright-line" test to determine how long the employee must perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation to be eligible for reassignment. However, "the longer the period of time in which an employee has adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, the more likely it is that reassignment is appropriate if the employee becomes unable to continue performing the essential functions of the current position due to a disability." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If, however, the probationary employee has never adequately performed the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, then he is not entitled to reassignment because he was never "qualified" for the original position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find Complainant was a probationary employee who was never qualified for the position he held, which was patent examiner, the Agency was not obligated to reassign him prior to his termination. <span class="Italic">See Shelley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070076 (June 14, 2012) (finding that the complainant, a probationary employee, was unable to establish that he was qualified because he could not establish that he could perform the essential functions of his position for which he was hired after he was hospitalized due to a medical condition after working for the agency for several days.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to his request for reassignment, Complainant also requested Dragon Naturally Speaking software and authorization to work voluntary unpaid overtime as reasonable accommodations. As noted above, the Agency installed the software on Complainant's laptop by June 29, 2018, and, on July 2, 2018, trained Complainant to use it. Therefore, we find the Agency fulfilled this request. With respect to the requested voluntary unpaid overtime, the record establishes that the FLSA prohibits agencies from allowing GS-07 level employees, such as Complainant, to work unpaid overtime. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S. Code &#x00A7; 5542(a)(1). Furthermore, working unpaid overtime would have resulted in lowering Complainant's performance standards and the Commission has held that the Agency is not required, under the Rehabilitation Act, to lower performance standards of a position as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Olson v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983200 (July 19, 2001); <span class="Italic">Graziano v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Agency Appeal No. 0120070745 (April 15, 2009). For these reasons, we find the Agency was not obliged to provide Complainant the requested unpaid overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receiving a request for reasonable accommodation, an agency "must make a reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation." 29 C.F.R. pt. 1614. app. &#x00A7; 1630.9. Thus, "it may be necessary for the [agency] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability...[to] identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9; Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation at Q. 5. Here, the record shows that the Agency was engaged with Complainant towards accommodating his disability and provided Complainant with accommodations including assistance with note taking and special software. Upon receipt of information from Complainant's medical provider, the Agency followed up with the medical provider to ascertain and clarify Complainant's limitations relating to his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency made a reasonable effort to determine what, if any, accommodations were appropriate. For all these reasons, we find the Agency did not fail to provide Complainant a reasonable accommodation.</p>
