<h4 class="h4" id="sec22-27"><span class="space">1.</span> Prevailing Market Rate and Nonlocal Counsel</h4>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, for the purpose of determining the prevailing market rate, the relevant community is the area where the agency facility and complainant are located. <span class="Italic">Black v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01921158 (1993). Affidavits relating to the prevailing community rate in the area where the attorney practices law are not relevant to the prevailing market rate determination in cases where the actual representation occurred in another location. As discussed below, there is an exception, however, when skilled local counsel is not "readily available" in the geographic area where the case takes place.</p>
<p class="noindent">When there is no evidence available of the prevailing market rate for EEO work in the lawyer's locale, the Commission will determine a reasonable fee based on the experience and reputation of the counsel involved. <span class="Italic">Ewers v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01850792 (1986). The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that local counsel was readily available to the complainant. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110036 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">Federal employees often find themselves in a position where experienced local counsel is simply not available. The reality is that the federal government has installations throughout the country, but attorneys who represent federal employees tend to be clustered in pockets generally in the major metropolitan areas. In such cases, questions can arise as to which prevailing market should dictate the reasonable hourly rate--the prevailing local market where the employee is stationed and the litigation actually takes place, or the prevailing market where the attorney routinely practices law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The determination as to which prevailing market rate should apply requires consideration of whether the employee could have readily found counsel in his or her local area with the requisite experience and skill required for the case. <span class="Italic">See Hatfield v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892909 (1989). In that case, the complainant, who was employed by the agency in Puerto Rico, retained counsel from Washington, D.C. to represent her. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hatfield</span> rejected an agency argument that counsel's reasonable hourly rate should be determined by the prevailing rate in San Juan:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant asserts that she was unable to find an attorney in Puerto Rico with the requisite experience in EEO matters who was willing to take her case. Therefore, on a referral from the Federally Employed Women's Legal Defense Fund she contacted her current counsel in Washington, D.C. and retained them. The law firm has an extensive background and expertise in handling employment discrimination cases, especially in the federal sector.... Appellant's attorneys contacted each of the six law firms highlighted in the San Juan yellow pages by the agency. Four of these law firms responded, and two indicated they would not have represented appellant in this matter, while the other two might have considered representing her but indicated no particular experience in federal employee discrimination matters. The two nonresponses raise an inference that they also would not have been interested in accepting this case.... The hourly rates cited by the four firms responding also dispute the agency's characterization of the prevailing rates in San Juan as around $125.00 per hour. The hourly rates quoted ranged from $70.00 to $150.00 for junior associates and $150.00 to $225.00 for senior attorneys and partners....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that, under the facts of this particular case, appellant's attorneys should be compensated at Washington, D.C. rates. While the fee customarily charged in a locality remains a factor to be considered in determining hourly rates, when "a party does not find counsel <span class="Italic">readily</span> <span class="Italic">available</span> in that locality with whatever degree of skill may reasonably be required, it is reasonable that the party go elsewhere to find an attorney, and the court should make the allowance on the basis of the chosen attorney's billing rate." <span class="Italic">Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal Inc.</span>, 670 F.2d 760, 769 (7th Cir. 1982) (emphasis added by Commission). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Maceira v. Pagan</span>, 698 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, appellant alleges that she could not find attorneys in Puerto Rico experienced in federal EEO matters willing to take her case. Therefore, on a referral from a federal employee women's group, appellant sought out and retained her current counsel, a law firm with extensive experience in federal sector employment discrimination cases. The agency has not shown that appellant's decision to retain out-of-town counsel was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Maceira</span>, 698 at 40. Using the agency's own evidence from the telephone book, counsel discovered that none of these attorneys would have been willing to represent appellant or had the requisite experience to do so. It is clear from the record that this case involved a novel, peculiarly federal, EEO issue regarding the comparison of a civilian employee to active duty military personnel. Appellant clearly benefitted from her counsel's knowledge of Title VII law and experience in dealing with federal agencies in federal sector employment discrimination matters. Counsel did not incur unreasonable expenses in this matter, conducting all proceedings by mail or the telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the agency never once suggested that appellant should have retained local counsel or voiced an objection to her choice of attorneys during the over two-year period it took to settle this case. The agency negotiated the settlement agreement to pay attorney fees in this matter still not raising the issue of appellant's retention of non-local counsel. It was only after the agency received counsel's fee request and was not happy with it that this self-serving objection was raised. Equity requires that we consider this lack of prior objection by the agency to be another factor supporting our decision that counsel should be compensated at Washington, D.C. rates.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission then analyzed the prevailing market rates for an award in the case based on Washington area prevailing market rates. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">William v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01984753 (2001) (prevailing market rate for an attorney was approved at Philadelphia rates where a skilled attorney was not reasonably available in Altoona, PA). The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that the complainant's selection of out-of-town counsel was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120111028 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Moore v. Attorney General</span>, 0120072439 (2007), the complainant was represented by a union official at the hearing level in a case heard in the San Antonio Field Office. However, the union official did not feel competent to represent the complainant at the appellate stage and assisted the complainant in finding counsel located in Silver Spring, MD. After prevailing on the appeal, the agency argued that counsel was not entitled to his customary hourly rate, but a rate more commensurate with the San Antonio area. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, rejected the agency's argument holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a party does not find counsel readily available in that locality with whatever degree of skill may reasonably be required, it is reasonable that the party go elsewhere to find an attorney. <span class="Italic">Southerland v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A05403 (October 16, 2002) (citation omitted). On the other hand, if a high-priced, out-of-town attorney renders services which local attorneys could do as well, and there is no other reason to have them performed by the former, then it may be appropriate to allow only the hourly rate which local attorneys charged for the same service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The burden is on the agency to show that complainant's decision to retain out-of-town counsel was unreasonable.<span class="Italic"> Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the agency was able to find one attorney in the general geographic area who would have charged a lesser rate, the Commission found that there was no evidence that the complainant could have located that attorney. In addition, the Commission found that the complainant submitted ample evidence of her fruitless search for competent area counsel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720080046 (2009), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the appropriate prevailing market rate was between $200 and $225 per hour and approved a rate of $300 for out-of-state counsel. Noting that the burden is on the agency to demonstrate the availability of competent local counsel, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Elliott</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues, as noted above, that complainant did not seek a local attorney before choosing an attorney from Colorado. According to the agency, complainant could have been "represented by one of the hundreds of capable lawyers in Harrison County [Mississippi]." Consequently, the agency asserts that the award of fees should be based on the market value of the local community, rather than the higher rate charged by the out-of-state firm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that the evidence presented by the agency is insufficient to establish that complainant's decision to use out-of-state counsel was unreasonable. The agency's supporting evidence includes an affidavit from a local attorney, who has practiced in the area for over ten years. While the local attorney attests that he represents clients "in various, employment related administrative proceedings," additional details are absent. There is no indication that the attorney has represented a client in the EEO process. Similarly, we find that the affiant's estimate of 300 attorneys in the Gulf Coast area that perform "this type of legal work," to be speculative and unsupported by any documentation. While the other two attorneys that provided affidavits stated that they have represented clients in EEOC proceedings, at rates of $200/per hour and $225 per/hour, we do not find that the evidence of two attorneys in the area is evidence that appropriately skilled counsel was "readily available."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the hourly billing rate, complainant's attorney maintains that his customary rate is $300/per hour. The Commission views the attorney's own customary billing rate as the most reliable evidence of prevailing rates. <span class="Italic">See Neves v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. <span id="Page_1994"></span>01974717 (January 14, 2000). While the agency contends that the complainant's evidence is insufficient to support her claim for $300/per hour, the Commission disagrees. The agency itself observed that complainant's attorney presented: a billing statement reflecting the $300/per hour rate for the instant case, an affidavit stating that the firm usually charged this rate, and a copy of a case where the attorney was previously awarded such rate. We note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Management Directive 110 (MD-110) at 11-9 does not require an affidavit from the fee applicant that the requested rate is the attorney's normal billing rate and supporting affidavits from area attorneys. Instead, the relevant provision states that one of these or a list of comparable cases where a similar rate was accepted will suffice. Therefore, based on the evidence provided by complainant's attorney, we find that the attorney is entitled to a rate of $300.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Coffee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120093008 (2009), the Commission upheld a fee award of $350 per hour for an attorney from the Tidewater, Florida area for a case heard in Texarkana, Texas. The Commission found that the burden to demonstrate that the complainant's decision to retain out-of-town counsel was unreasonable was on the agency. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mason v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120093849 (2013) (approving $350 rate for attorney in Tidewater, VA where competent local counsel was not available in Beckley, W.VA.).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld a fee award based on the prevailing market rates in Washington, D.C., for a case heard in Las Vegas in <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090032 (2009). Again emphasizing that the burden was on the agency to establish the availability of local counsel, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion when he determined that the agency failed to establish that complainant's use of an out-of-state attorney was unreasonable. We note that the AJ based this decision on defensible criteria including: the fact that the agency never lodged an objection during the proceedings to the location of complainant's counsel: some of the actions at issue were handled by Washington-based agency officials: some of the agency officials called to testify had Washington duty stations: and agency counsel was permanently located in the Washington metropolitan area. Accordingly, we affirm the AJ's approval of an hourly rate based on the prevailing market rates in the Washington, D.C. area. In addition, we find no abuse of discretion has been established by the agency in the AJ's decision to apply the "delay of payment" standard to the entire litigation period. <span class="Italic">See Missouri v. Jenkins,</span> 491 U.S. 274 (1989). As such we conclude that it was reasonable for the AJ to apply an hourly rate of $440.00 to complainant's entire attorney fee request.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05403 (2002), the Commission found that the attorney was not entitled to her prevailing rate in Philadelphia, but the prevailing rate in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable hourly rates are measured by the prevailing market rates in the relevant community <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984); <span class="Italic">Brent v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05901175 (January 8, 1991). This dispute raises two issues, the first of which is whether Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Greensboro, North Carolina, is the relevant community for the purposes of determining the prevailing market rate. Counsel claims that she is entitled to be paid at the rate of $250, as that is the prevailing rate in Philadelphia, where she is located. The agency responds that counsel should be paid at the rate charged by attorneys in Greensboro, North Carolina, as that is where the case was heard and where complainant was located. That rate rose from $130 in 1991 to $165 in 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a party does not find counsel readily available in that locality with whatever degree of skill may reasonably be required, it is reasonable that the party go elsewhere to find an attorney<span class="Italic">. Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc.</span>, 670 F.2d 760, 769 (7th Cir. 1982). On the other hand, if a high-priced, out-of-town attorney renders services which local attorneys could do as well, and there is no other reason to have them performed by the former, then it may be appropriate to allow only the hourly rate which local attorneys charged for the same service<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 768; <span class="Italic">Maceira v. Pagan</span>, 698 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden is on the agency to show that complainant's decision to retain out-of-town counsel was unreasonable<span class="Italic">. See Id.</span> (The Local has not shown that plaintiff's decision to retain [out-of-town counsel] was unreasonable). In this case, the agency has presented extensive documentation of the availability of local counsel. Among the documents submitted by the agency are: fee petitions, billing records, affidavits, and disbursement records. These documents show that this local attorney was highly skilled and experienced at representing federal employees in employment discrimination cases, particularly postal workers, before the Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board. This individual's skill and experience is comparable to counsel's. We note that the Greensboro attorney won a case involving disability discrimination, which was at issue in complainant's case. While counsel is, without a doubt, a highly skilled and capable professional, she has not shown that she has a unique specialty within the field of employment discrimination that complainant needed to utilize but was not available to complainant in North Carolina. We therefore find that the agency presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that the local rate in Greensboro, North Carolina should be considered as counsel's hourly rate. This brings us to the second issue, namely what the hourly rate should be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We noted the agency's assertion that the hourly rate for attorneys handling employment discrimination cases rose from $130 to $165 between 1991 and 2000. We also noted that, in calculating counsel's fees, the agency applied the rate for a particular year to the hours that counsel expended during that year. For example, for 1991, the agency awarded counsel $9,711 for 74.7 hours at the hourly rate of $130. The agency did the same thing for hours worked in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996-1999, and 2000. This approach is incorrect. In order to ensure that counsel is not deprived of the value of her fees owing to a delay in the resolution of a case, the Commission follows the practice of awarding fees at current, rather than historical hourly rates for all work performed on a complaint<span class="Italic">. Huyck v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952015 (October 31, 1997): <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05980159 (July 10, 1998). In this case, the agency stated in its final decision on attorneys fees that the final adjudication of this case took place on April 11, 2000, when the Commission denied the agency's request for reconsideration of complainant's appeal. Since the hourly rate in North Carolina was $165 at that time, counsel's fees will be awarded based on this rate.</p>

Postmaster General</span>, 0120133350 (2015) (agency established that competent local counsel were available in Louisville, KY area and disapproved Washington, D.C. rates); <span class="Italic">Taber v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110658 (2012) (agency submitted list of attorneys specializing in employment discrimination law in Raleigh, N.C. and request for Washington, D.C. rates rejected); <span class="Italic">O'Malley v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080013 (2009), upholding a 25% reduction in fee for a Washington, D.C. firm where the case was heard in Miami.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harden v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720080002 (2011), the Commission found that an out-of-state union counsel was entitled to the prevailing market rate in Washington, D.C., for a case tried in Alabama. The Commission not only found that the agency had not demonstrated that competent local counsel was available to the complainant, but also her decision to use out-of-state counsel was justified by the fact that she was a union member entitled to union counsel at no charge. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Harden</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Complainant could have retained an attorney in Alabama, where all of the parties were located, instead of a Washington, D.C. attorney. The Commission has held that if a party does not find counsel readily available in that locality with whatever degree of skill that may reasonably be required, it is reasonable that the party go elsewhere to find an attorney. <span class="Italic">See Southerland v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A05403 (Oct. 16, 2002). On the other hand, if a high-priced, out-of-town attorney renders services which local attorneys could do as well, and there is no other reason to have them performed by the former, then it may be appropriate to allow only the hourly rate which local attorneys charge for the same service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The burden is on the Agency to show that Complainant's decision to retain out-of-town counsel was not reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Complainant did not seek a local attorney before choosing an attorney from Washington, D.C. According to the Agency, "a Martindale-Hubbell search indicates that there are almost 11,000 attorneys in Alabama in 2007; of that total number, 551 list labor and employment law as an area of practice." Consequently, the Agency asserts that the award of fees should be based on the market value of the local community. The Agency notes that Complainant's counsel graduated from law school in 1998, while the Agency has provided affidavits from local attorneys, one of whom has practiced in the area since 1997, and charges an hourly rate of $250.00. The Agency also provided affidavits from attorneys in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who graduated from law school in 1989 and 1986 and charge less than $305.00 per hour.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that the evidence presented by the Agency is insufficient to establish that Complainant's decision to use out-of-state counsel was not reasonable. Given that Complainant was a dues-paying member of AFGE, which provides the services of its attorneys as a benefit to its members, we find, as provided for in <span class="Italic">Southerland,</span> that there was another reason to have these services performed by an out of town attorney, i.e., not having to pay a private attorney in Alabama to represent her. Moreover, we note that the AFGE attorney that Complainant hired specializes in EEO matters for federal employees; therefore, we find that it was certainly reasonable for Complainant to retain her as counsel. Moreover, we find that counsel's rate of $305.00/hour is reasonable, as are the specific attorney's fees requested.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mohar v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100019 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120072203 (2009), the Commission <span id="Page_1995"></span>rejected an agency argument that the hourly rate of counsel should be reduced from the time he moved from Cincinnati, OH, to Traverse City, MI, which the agency described as a "smaller 'vacation/retirement' community. The Commission gave no detailed analysis of its response to the agency's argument simply noting that the counsel was entitled to the hourly rate he had in Cincinnati because that's where he was when the case began.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though it may come as a surprise to some lawyers in Atlanta, GA, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120083765 (2012), awarded Washington, D.C. rates using the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix finding the agency had not demonstrated the availability of skilled local counsel. The Commission noted a statement from the complainant that he had looked unsuccessfully for local counsel and was referred to his Washington representatives by a union counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case where the complainant resided in Houston, but was assigned to work in the D.C. area three days a week, the Commission found that the complainant was justified in seeking counsel in the D.C. area. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140049 (2015), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reasonable hourly rate is generally determined by the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation. <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984). The Agency determined that Complainant should be awarded the prevailing rates for attorneys in the Houston, Texas area where Complainant lives and actions identified in the complaint arose. On appeal, Complainant contends that the "<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix" of attorney's fees established by the U.S. Attorney's Office should be used to determine the reasonable hourly rate. Complainant states that she was living and working in the Washington, D.C. area during the relevant time period, as directed by her supervisor, S1, who placed Complainant on mandatory travel. Thus, Complainant maintains that the Agency should have used the "<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix" for the Washington, D.C. area market rate. We note that the Commission and courts have held that the hourly rate for Washington, D.C. area attorneys is generally determined by the "<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jimenez v. Dep't of Health and Human Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120083765 (June 12, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also has found that if a party does not find counsel readily available in her locality with whatever degree of skill that may reasonably be required, it is reasonable that the party may go elsewhere to find an attorney even if it results in the payment of a higher hourly rate than the prevailing market in the location where the action arose. <span class="Italic">See Southerland v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A05403 (Oct. 16, 2002). If a higher-priced, out-of-town attorney, however, renders services which local attorneys could do as well, and there is no other reason to have them performed by the out-of-town attorney, then it may be appropriate to allow only the hourly rate which local attorneys charged for the same service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find the record shows that in April 2008, Complainant was required by her supervisor to work in the Washington, D.C. area, at the Agency's Arlington, Virginia facility on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Complainant filed the instant complaint in February 2008, and we find she reasonably retained counsel from Washington, D.C. counsel where she was living and working during most weekdays. The Agency points out that Complainant consistently used her home address in Houston, Texas for contact throughout the EEO complaints process. We find that Complainant reasonably requested that correspondence be sent to her Texas home address where she was living Friday through Monday, and which address appears to be her permanent, family residence. Nevertheless, for three out of five business days, when Complainant presumably was available to meet with counsel, she was located in the Washington, D.C. area. We therefore find that the Agency erred in calculating the appropriate award of attorney's fees based upon the prevailing market rates for attorneys practicing in Houston, Texas rather than in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p class="noindent">Generalized evidence of the prevailing market rate will not be accepted. It is not sufficient to support a fee petition with affidavits from other attorneys stating the hourly rate generally requested for such cases. The affidavits did not provide any information about the hourly rate actually received or awarded to those attorneys. <span class="Italic">See Thorburn v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01891799 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Postmaster General</span>, 01893051 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Byrd</span>, the appellant's counsel submitted an affidavit attesting that he charged and received the requested rate, along with supporting affidavits by other counsel. The Commission also noted that, although it approved a lesser rate for appellant's counsel in a previous case, a higher rate would have been reasonable had it been counsel's customary billing rate. Apparently, counsel took the Commission at its word and promptly raised his rates.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01961461 (1998), the Commission approved a $40 per hour reduction in the requested rate where the attorney provided only general information about local attorney rates, and all of that information related to firms of nearly 100 lawyers or more, and the complainant's attorney was a partner in a four-member firm. In further support of the reduction, the Commission noted that the attorney referred to himself as the "lead" counsel on the case but did not make it clear what role, if any, others had played in representing the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">When neither the complainant nor the agency submits adequate evidence on the prevailing market rate, nothing precludes the administrative judge from gathering his own information on the prevailing rate. In <span class="Italic">Drummond-Irving v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060051 (2007), the complainant contended that the hourly rate for her attorneys should be between $400 and $460 and the agency contended the appropriate rate was $200. The administrative judge found that evidence presented by complainant on the prevailing market rate was inapposite because it was from attorneys who specialized in police misconduct and multiple plaintiff employment discrimination cases. The agency submitted no real support for its contention that the appropriate Chicago rate was $200. As a result, the administrative judge surveyed 12 attorneys in the area who had previously represented complainants before him. The Commission found that there was no abuse of discretion in the judge's method.</p>
