<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-43"><span class="space">C.</span> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Affirmative action plans are addressed in detail in <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>. They are addressed here to the extent that an agency raises use of an affirmative action plan as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all employment decisions in which prohibited motives are a factor constitute illegal discrimination. In some instances, it is permissible for an agency to consider such factors as race, sex, religion, etc., in making an employment determination. The most obvious of these instances is where the agency uses such factors to effectuate its affirmative action program.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general, the EEOC follows the guidance of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America v. Weber</span>, 443 U.S. 193, 99 S. Ct. 2721, 61 L. Ed.2d 480 (1979), that "if an affirmative action plan mirrored the purpose of Title VII, did not trammel the interests of white employees or create an absolute bar to advancement, [and] was used as a temporary measure to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance," the plan is permissible. <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01832032 (1984). In upholding the decision of the agency to consider race and sex in the selection of two equally qualified candidates for a promotion, the EEOC noted that 713(b) of Title VII provides that no person shall be liable for an unlawful employment practice if he, in good faith, relies upon a written opinion or interpretation of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission then went on to acknowledge its own regulations at 29 CFR Part 1608, which address affirmative action under Title VII. If the affirmative action plan that forms the basis for the complaint is one that has already been approved, the Commission will issue a finding of no discrimination. If the plan has not been subject to approval, it will be reviewed for compliance with Title VII and Exec. Order 11246, and if found to be in compliance, a determination of no discrimination will issue. Further, the Commission noted that EEOC Management Directive 707 specifically provides that the affirmative action guidelines codified at 29 CFR 1608.12 constitute an EEOC interpretation which may be relied upon by federal agencies as a 713(b) defense.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an affirmative action plan is raised as a legitimate reason for the agency's action does not alter the applicability of the general <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. USPS</span>, 01862399 (1987). In that case, the agency asserted that an affirmative action plan was the reason for its nonselection of a black male to a postal inspector position. The plan excluded black males because of their "overrepresentation" in that position, but the plan did apply to females, as well as certain minority males. In <span class="Italic">Dorsey</span>, the Commission noted, however:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant has presented evidence that the agency's explanation is pretextual, and that the plan as applied to appellant is unlawful. In evaluating an affirmative action program for women, the court in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County</span>, 55 U.S.L.W. 4379 (March 25, 1987) considered whether the plan "unnecessarily trammeled the rights of male employees or created an absolute bar to their advancement." <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> at 4385. In <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Weber</span>, 443 U.S. 193, 208 (1979), in evaluating an affirmative action plan for blacks, the court considered these effects of the plan on employees not included in the program, as well as the fact that the plan was "a temporary measure. . .not intended to maintain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance." In addition, the EEOC regulations provide guidelines for evaluating affirmative action plans. 29 CFR Section 1608.4(c)(2) states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In considering the reasonableness of a particular affirmative action plan or program, the Commission will generally apply the following standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;The plan should be tailored to solve the problems which were identified in the self analysis,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Section 1608.4(a), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and to ensure that employment systems operate fairly in the future, while avoiding unnecessary restrictions on opportunities for the workforce as a whole. The race, sex, and national origin conscious provisions of the plan or program should be maintained only so long as is necessary to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found the plan in <span class="Italic">Dorsey</span> was pretextual because there was no indication that it was a temporary measure; unlike plans that allowed race or sex to be taken into consideration with other factors, the <span class="Italic">Dorsey</span> plan allowed race and sex to insulate certain persons from comparison with other applicants; and the evidence showed that other minority males were overrepresented in the positions at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency raises its affirmative action plan as a defense, it must establish that it has a written affirmative action plan. In the alternative, the agency must show that its unwritten policy is based on an analysis conducted by the agency. The absence of a written plan makes it much more difficult to prove the defense and the EEOC will carefully scrutinize the evidence presented on the agency's analysis. <span class="Italic">Mayora v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 01841342 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">"[A]lthough an employer must generally seek to avoid a charge of pretext by presenting evidence in support of its plan, reliance on an affirmative action plan is <span class="Italic">not</span> to be treated as an affirmative defense requiring the employer to carry the burden of <span class="Italic">proving</span> the validity of the plan. The burden of proving its invalidity remains on the complainant." <span class="Italic">Beckett v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05880086 (1988) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that a particular selection assists an agency in fulfilling its affirmative action guidelines is not indicative that this was the reason for the selection. <span class="Italic">See Maley v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01842676 (1986). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Worsham v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01965683 (1999), the Commission held that the fact that a selection assisted the agency in fulfilling affirmative action goals was not an indicia of discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Worsham</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the instant appeal, appellant argues that the agency admitted that race and sex were motivating reasons behind the selection, and that subjective factors were used as further basis for the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds insufficient evidence of discrimination in the agency's acknowledgment that the decision to chose the selectee had the additional benefit of being supportive of the its affirmative action goals. The SO was able to articulate and support the other reasons for his selection. Specifically, the selectee was more supportive of the resident initiatives program and had a management style preferable to that of appellant. The preponderance of the evidence does not support appellant's contention that the agency's consideration of its affirmative action goals played a deciding role in the selection. Indeed, the SO specifically testified that such considerations were not the deciding factors in his decision to chose the selectee. Accordingly, it is the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to AFFIRM the agency's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Temple v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01954924 (1997), the Commission took a different approach and found that the selecting official's reliance on the agency's affirmative action plan as "tie breaker" was direct evidence of discrimination. The Commission found that the selecting official's statement to the EEO counselor, "[a]s a tie breaker I took EEO and Affirmative Action standards into consideration, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> women were under represented in the Marine Cargo 2161 series," constituted direct evidence of discrimination. Because the agency stipulated that it did not have an affirmative employment plan in place at that time, the Commission concluded that the selecting official's consideration of gender as a tie breaker was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Roberts v. U.S. Information Agency</span>, 01965379 (1998), the Commission found, based in part on the agency's stated diversity goals, that the complainant proved discrimination based on gender:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that the IG's articulated reason for his reassignment was a pretext for sex discrimination. He asserts that the IG's clearly stated goal was to ensure diversity on her senior staff. Appellant argues that: his background is in M &#x0026; A, not Audits; he was not qualified for the position to which he was reassigned; and the real reason for his reassignment was that he is a white male.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant's evidence is sufficient to establish pretext. The IG admitted to making certain remarks regarding diversity in the OIG work force. She explained that there were no women or minorities in permanent senior management positions and she felt that the senior staff was not representative of the OIG staff as a whole, the agency as a whole, or the agency's customers. The IG referred to an agency civil rights plan and the President's policy on diversity in the Federal work force, and said that she had to be mindful of these policies when the opportunity arose to hire new people in her office. A review of appellant's SF-171, included in the record, supports his assertion that his background is in M &#x0026; A. Although the IG stated that appellant's talents could be better used in Audits, she provided no further explanation in that regard, e.g., how appellant's talents could be put to better use in an area in which he had no background; why the M &#x0026; A Office would lack the "demeanor" she desired if appellant continued working there, and so on. Based on the foregoing facts, the Commission finds it more likely than not that the IG reassigned appellant so that she could place the GM-15 female employee in charge of the M &#x0026; A Office. The Commission finds that appellant's reassignment constituted unlawful discrimination based on sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, as with many issues, the Commission's position on the use of protected status as a criterion for selection remains unclear. In <span class="Italic">Pulz v. U.S. Information Agency</span>, 01960244 (1998), the Commission found that an agency's plan to increase the representation of minorities and women in the workplace does not, by itself, constitute illegal discrimination. One of the factors for the selection process in <span class="Italic">Pulz</span> was an agency EEO policy to increase the representation of minorities and women:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S-3 testified that his recommendation of the ST was based on the <span id="Page_720"></span>following factors: the ST's supervisory skills and potential exceeded those of appellant; the ST was sufficiently competent to oversee the technical requirements of the position; and there was an agency emphasis to increase the representation of minorities and women in all areas and levels of the workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that S-3 had been told by the Director of the BB to take into consideration the agency's EEO policies and EEO 10-point plan to increase the representation of minorities and women. The Director also reminded S-3 that EEO compliance was one of the elements of his performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">There was also evidence that a selection factor was removed from the vacancy announcement in <span class="Italic">Pulz</span>, but a selecting official testified that the removed factor was not essential for the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S-1 testified that he did not know why the position's vacancy announcement (VA) was amended to remove the "screen-out factor," which mandated that applicants possess extensive knowledge of the conversion of various TV signals. He noted that knowledge of these conversions was not essential for the position, because the conversion decisions were not made at the Technical Operations Center.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pulz</span> found that the agency articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for hiring the selectee, including the agency's affirmative action program:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), we find that appellant is able to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on race and sex. Nevertheless, the agency is able to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for choosing the ST. These were her strong supervisory skills, her technical competence, and the agency's affirmative action program to increase the number of under represented women and minorities at all levels of the workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that the complainant failed to show pretext, noting that, although the complainant was technically more qualified than the selectee, the selectee had greater supervisory potential, and therefore the two candidates were "equally qualified." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pulz</span> also found that the deleted selection factor was not indicative of pretext, because the factor was not essential for the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's attorney attempts to show that these reasons are a pretext for discrimination by pointing out that S-1, who was in a position to know, rated appellant higher than the ST in technical skill and her equal in supervisory skill. He also noted that no one could explain why the "screen-out factor" had been eliminated from the amended VA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determines, however, that the ST was essentially equally qualified for the position as was appellant, for the following reasons: First, while S-1 found appellant to be more technically qualified than the ST, he also found that the ST's technical skills and knowledge were adequate for the position and second only to appellant's. Second, although S-1 rated appellant equal to the ST in supervisory skills, he admitted that appellant had problems dealing with co-workers in the past, although he had made significant progress in his people skills. S-1 did not state that the ST had any similar problems as an acting supervisor, however. Thus, we find that S-2 and S-3 were justified in finding that ST had greater supervisory skills and potential than appellant. In addition, we find that the deletion of the "screenout factor" in the amended VA was not indicative of pretext, as S-1 testified that knowledge of the conversion of various TV signals was not essential for the position. Therefore, we conclude that while appellant's technical skill and knowledge outweighed those of the ST, the ST's technical skills were still adequate for the position, while the ST's supervisory skills outweighed those of appellant, making both of them essentially equally qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Pulz</span> found that no particular group was targeted for selection, and that consideration of diversity goals was permissible:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, while appellant alleged that the agency impermissibly considered its affirmative action goal of increasing the representation of minorities and women, our review of the selection procedure in this case does not indicate that any particular group was targeted for selection. The Commission has previously ruled that consideration of agency diversity goals does not in itself make the selection process discriminatory<span class="Italic">. See Jones v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941940 (Mar. 28, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Absent some showing of discrimination against the individual complainant, an employee or applicant has no cause of action under Title VII because the agency fails to implement or utilize an affirmative action plan. <span class="Italic">See Bullard v. Department of Army</span>, 01860471 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 723 F.2d 871 (11th Cir. 1984)). In that case, the appellant admitted that he did not apply for the position at issue in the complaint.</p>
