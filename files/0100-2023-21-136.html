<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-127"><span class="space">2.</span> Racial Slurs</h4>
<p class="noindent">The analysis for hostile environment cases involving race is the same as for hostile environment cases involving sex discussed in detail earlier. A good example of the analysis is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120123332 (2014), which also demonstrates that not all of the conduct directed at the complainant needs to be explicitly based on race to contribute to a hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision addressed only the question of imputing liability to the Agency, the last prong of the harassment analysis. We will address each prong of the harassment analysis. Regarding the first prong, the record reveals that Complainant is an African-American who identifies his color as black. Therefore, Complainant is a member of statutorily protected classes. Regarding the second prong, Complainant and multiple witnesses stated that C1 called him "nigger," "worthless nigger," and "ignorant nigger" in the workplace. We note that the Agency issued a formal reprimand to C1 based on its conclusion that, between January 2011 and March 2011, C1 called Complainant a "nigger" in the presence of C6. The reprimand also stated that in a meeting with management on April 15, 2011, C1 commented on her use of the word "nigger." Additionally, the reprimand noted that several employees submitted statements in early April 2011 that reported that C1 used racial or ethnic slurs such as "nigger," "chink," and "spic" to refer to other employees and their spouses. Consequently, we conclude that the Agency clearly acknowledges that C1 subjected Complainant to unwelcome conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the third prong, the record reflects that C1 openly called and referred to Complainant as a "nigger," "worthless nigger," and "ignorant nigger." Additionally, witnesses stated that C1 often targeted Complainant with various other verbal insults and attacks, especially disliked African-Americans, called other African-Americans "niggers," and openly used racial epithets against Hispanics and Asians. We note that the Commission has held that the use of the word "nigger" is a "highly charged epithet" that reflects animus against African-Americans and "dredges up the entire history of racial discrimination in this country." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 15, "Race and Color Discrimination," No. 915.003, 15-38 (Apr. 19, 2006); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950494 (June 25, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, insults such as a "fucking pig," "idiot," and "stupid" cannot be divorced from C1's common use of racial epithets and insults against Complainant and others. Instead, they are a part of C1's attempt to demean Complainant as inferior because of his race. <span class="Italic">See Almon v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720090023 (Feb. 9, 2011) (referring to African-American employee as a "monkey" derived from a long history of portraying African-Americans as subhuman or inferior). Additionally, in this context, C1's threat to chain Complainant to a chair also reflects racist animus against him. Thus, it is clear that C1 targeted Complainant because he is African-American.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding prong 4, we note that C1's conduct was extremely insulting, threatening, and dehumanizing. C1's conduct is especially serious in light of the fact that she sometimes served as Complainant's team leader or acting supervisor. Consequently, we find that C1's conduct was sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Frank v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120110221 (Jan. 31, 2013) (single instance of using "nigger" in workplace sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment); <span class="Italic">King v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120093395 (Nov. 24, 2009) (referring to Complainant as a "lazy nigger" and "lazy" sufficiently severe to create hostile work environment based on race); <span class="Italic">Cerros v. Steel Technologies, Inc</span>., 288 F.3d 1040, 1047 (7th Cir. 2002) (while there is no magic number of slurs that indicate a hostile work environment, an unambiguously racial epithet falls on the "more severe" end of the spectrum).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, it is undisputed that C1 often openly hurled racial slurs at Complainant and other employees as early as the winter of 2010. In fact, at least six coworkers stated that they witnessed C1 call Complainant and others racial slurs in the office for a significant period of time before Complainant initiated EEO counseling. The Agency cannot avoid liability for coworker harassment simply because it adopted a "see no evil, hear no evil" response. <span class="Italic">See Ocheltree v. Scollon Productions, Inc</span>., 335 F. 3d 323 (4th Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). We find that the harassment was so pervasive and widespread that the Agency had constructive knowledge of the harassment well before S1 contends that he acquired actual knowledge. <span class="Italic">See Gillespie v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080758 (May 25, 2012) (agency had constructive notice of harassment when various witnesses testified that harassing conduct was frequent); <span class="Italic">Mayer v. Dep't</span> <span class="Italic">of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120071846 (May 15, 2009) (agency had constructive knowledge of sexual harassment where several incidents of harassment occurred in front of co-workers); <span class="Italic">Sharp v. City of Houston</span>, 164 F.3d 923 (5th Cir. 1999) (if harassment complained of is so open and pervasive that employer should have known of it had it opened its eyes, there is constructive notice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action after S1 learned of the racial harassment, following Complainant's contact with an EEO Counselor. The record reveals that on April 5, 2011, the Agency issued C1 a non-disciplinary letter of counseling that generally noted that C1 used "offensive" language on March 31, 2011, but did not address her use of racial slurs. The Agency also issued C1 notice of proposed reprimand on May 16, 2011, after Complainant resigned "under protest" from the Agency in a letter dated May 9, 2011. Moreover, the Agency did not actually reprimand C1 until July 5, 2011, and did not reassign C1 to another division until August/September 2011. The Agency took no action to end the harassment until well after the fact, and then only in response to Complainant's EEO complaint. For Complainant, the Agency's response was simply too little, too late.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that there is no evidence that C1 or employees received any anti-harassment training during the relevant time period, despite the open and widespread nature of the harassment in this case. We note that even the Director acknowledged that, although the harassment had been occurring for "a long time," multiple employees reported that S1 took no action about the matter and protected C1 from consequences. IF, p. 195. We are persuaded that the Agency's inadequate response to C1's racially-harassing conduct emboldened her to escalate her attacks on Complainant. In essence, the Agency's failure to properly discipline C1 conveyed the message that she could disrespect, intimidate, and harass Complainant with impunity, which she did. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091468 (Aug. 31, 2012). Likewise, the Agency's failure to promptly and effectively address C1's harassment of Complainant communicated to employees that the Agency did not take racial harassment seriously. Thus, we find that the Agency's response to the harassment was woefully inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a term is not blatantly racist, it must be evaluated in context. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123428 (2015), the Commission determined that a supervisor's use of the term "you people" was not racist where it was a reference to the supervisor's entire staff and not just the African-American complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ziola P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120170006 (2018) (the phrase "you people," without more, is not necessarily indicative of discriminatory intent). Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Van P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120140583 (2016), found that a single incident of a coworker writing the word "Rover" on a potluck sign-up sheet next to the Asian complainant's name was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. In that case, the complainant alleged that the word "Rover" meant "dog" and that the coworker's sign was racist based on a stereotype that Asians eat dog meat.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Tamara G. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120112387 (2015), the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment for the agency, stressing the need to evaluate comments that were not blatantly racist in context:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the "black bitch" remark, the Nurse Manager stated in her affidavit that she was a breeder of dogs and when she made the remark about her "black bitch," she was referring to one of her dogs who was going to have pups. Complainant was offended by the remark which she felt was racially directed. The AJ accepted the Nurse Manager's explanation that she was only making a reference to dogs and using language used by dog breeders. Two witnesses (White) to the incident signed a Report of Contact that Complainant submitted to the Agency in which Complainant stated that, not only did the Nurse Manager say that her bitch was having pups but she also said, "I can really get offensive and say black bitch." Complainant also stated that after the incident, she would hear some of the nurses saying in the hallway, "[O]h, I need a B-I-T-C-H (inaudible), woof, woof, you know, things like that."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is to be believed at the summary judgment stage. Instead, the AJ rejected Complainant's version of events and that of her witness and instead accepted the Nurse Manager's explanation that the remark <span id="Page_933"></span>was innocuous and racially neutral. In light of the conflicting statements, it was impermissible for the C to make credibility judgments by accepting the explanation of the Nurse Manager that she was referring only to dogs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that we have consistently held that, generally, one remark may not be sufficient to create a hostile environment. However, a hostile work environment under Title VII is a cumulative phenomenon, and a series of individual episodes of inappropriate behavior eventually can amount to a hostile environment. The "black bitch" remark therefore may be only one remark in a claim of harassment, but is relevant in finding whether a discriminatorily hostile work environment existed by examining the other incidents of alleged harassment identified by Complainant. The trier of fact must consider all of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission will not address the interpretation of the remark concerning welfare because this matter is being remanded for hearing. Nonetheless, we note that the AJ found that the comment was "neither racial nor discriminatory in nature" and that, when taken in the context of the conversation, it was "in no way whatsoever" a racial or discriminatory slur. However. according to Complainant, this statement came "out of the blue." The Commission finds it instructive to note that a comment that is non-discriminatory on its face may well be discriminatory if taken in context. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Sec. 15, para. VII(A)(2), Ex. 18 (Apr. 19, 2006). Here, the context to which the AJ refers is not explained in the record, leaving us unable to determine whether the comment was racially motivated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where a term is historically racist, the context of an alleged racial slur may still be probative. In <span class="Italic">Priscilla H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120162069 (2016), the complainant alleged race-based harassment when the director used the word "tar baby" at a staff meeting. In making the comment, the director was referencing an article in a medical journal that used the folktale of Br'er Rabbit and the tar baby as an analogy concerning an issue of patient care. While conceding that the complainant may have been offended by the comment, it was a one-time incident that was insufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01862270 (1987), no discrimination was found where the term "nigger" was used jokingly in the workplace and the complainant admitted he also engaged in similar banter. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Clay v. Attorney General, INS</span>, 01921236 (1992) (holding that use of the term "colored boy" was, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, derogatory and suggestive of racial prejudice). But the Commission in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> also found that the complainant failed to show any nexus between the comments and her termination. Although there has been some inconsistency in OFO decisions, the prevalent view is that one instance of the use of the word "nigger" in the workplace is sufficient to create a hostile environment because it "is a 'highly charged epithet' which 'dredge[s] up the entire history of racial discrimination in this country." <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073983 (2008), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950484 (1996). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Keys v. Attorney General</span>, 0120101315 (2010); <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120081565 (2008) (one instance of reference to supervisor as "HNIC," which stood for "Head Nigger in Charge"). It is not necessary that the term "nigger" be directed at the complainant to create a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Frank v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110223 (2013). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120133233 (2015) (single incident where "female supervisor (race not identified in the record) approached [Complainant] in a "threatening" manner and called him a "white motherfucker" did not state a claim for relief).</p>
<p class="noindent">Context and the agency's response to the allegedly harassing behavior was considered in <span class="Italic">Dante B. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 2019005188 (2020), where the complainant alleged that he was subjected to a hostile work environment when a coworker used the "n" word during a conversation. The word was used to describe an incident where a student had bullied the coworker's daughter and called her the "n" word. The complainant maintained that the incident was "extremely offensive" and "inappropriate." The context in which the word was used led the Commission to find that no evidence of racial harassment in <span class="Italic">Dante B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not shown that C1's a use of the "N" word on May 23, 2018, was motivated by racial animus. In the context of their conversation, C1 did not direct the "N" word at Complainant or use it in a manner intended to disparage African Americans. Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, she singled him out based on his race, to request advice about her daughter being harassed with the "N" word, he has not demonstrated that this single act was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a violation of Title VII. It is undisputed that C1 was not in a supervisory role with authority over Complainant, she sincerely apologized to Complainant when she realized she offended him, and ceased using the "N" word as soon as he informed her it was offensive and inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the evidence establishes that the Agency took immediate and appropriate corrective action. S1 counseled C1 on or close to the date of the incident, and there is no evidence that C1 used the "N" word in the workplace since then. S2 also counseled the security guard although the alleged incident happened years before. Finally, S2 also arranged the "all hands" meeting to address Complainant's general concern over employees' use of the "N" word in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues the Agency failed to take sufficient action, or take his claims seriously, because management did not report the matter to a Harassment Prevention Officer ("HPO") in accordance with Agency Policy. S1, S2, and S3 acknowledge that they did not report the incidents, but explained that they believed Complainant had not experienced harassment. S1 reasoned that Complainant "stated that he did not feel the word was directed toward him and felt that [C1] was just trying to get advice." They decided the matter did not qualify as harassment and the matter was resolved when management conducted both the counseling and training Complainant suggested in his May 23, 2018 email. Given the immediate and appropriate corrective action taken in response to the alleged underlying harassment, management's decision not to report Complainant's complaint to an HPO is not indicative of a failure to take appropriate corrective action in accordance with EEOC regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the parties' contentions on appeal, including those not specifically addressed herein, Complainant has not established discrimination as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Debbi V. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120182176 (2018), the Commission excused a coworker's comment to the complainant that "I need you to be my slave today" and explained the context of the comment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant's final two incidents, we find that the co-worker twice using the term "slave" in reference to needing Complainant to work in atypical areas does not rise to the level of actionable harassment. While the use of the word may have been offensive, we agree with the AJ that it was not severe or pervasive conduct such as to create an unlawful work environment on any basis. Additionally, the record reflects that the co-worker who made the comments was not in Complainant's direct supervisory chain, and was counseled about the comments she made to Complainant, and that she subsequently issued Complainant an apology. Thus, we find no basis for imputing liability to the Agency. In sum, we agree with the AJ's findings that the incidents, considered together and taken as a whole, do not rise to the level of a discriminatorily hostile workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency is not liable, though, where the complainant fails to bring the use of a racial slur by a coworker to the attention of management. In <span class="Italic">Frank v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110223 (2013), the complainant alleged that a coworker said she wished that management would "get rid of these niggers." The complainant brought a general allegation of harassment to the attention of management but did not specifically relate the alleged racial slur. The Commission agreed with the administrative judge that one incident of the use of the term "nigger" was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. However, the Commission also found that the agency was not liable because the complainant did not bring the slur to the attention of management and, in response to the general allegations, management promptly brought in a workplace environment analyst who made several recommendations to improve the work environment and also worked to resolve several personality conflicts and problems.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission uses the same analysis in cases involving allegations of racial harassment as it does in analyzing hostile environment claims brought on other bases. The complainant must show that he or she was subjected to unwelcome verbal or physical conduct, that the conduct was based on a protected category, that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment, and that there is some basis for imputing liability to the agency. For example, in <span class="Italic">Copwood v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120054544 (2007), the Commission rejected the agency's position that the conduct was not based on race and there was no basis for imputing liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment perpetuated by her co-workers and condoned by her supervisors, from the date of her entry into the work place in October 1999 until her transfer on or about June 2003. First, we set forth a brief statement of the law applicable to this claim. Harassment of an employee that would not occur but for the employee's race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion or prior EEO activity is unlawful. <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole,</span> 765 F.2d 1129, 1138-1139 (D.C. Cir. 1985). A single incident or group of isolated incidents will not normally be regarded as discriminatory harassment unless the conduct is severe. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.,</span> 684 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir. 1982). Whether the harassment is sufficiently severe to trigger a violation of Title VII must be determined by looking at all the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems,</span> 510 U.S. 17 (1993). The harasser's conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc.,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_934"></span>Based on the Commission's review of the record, we find the evidence persuasively establishes that complainant's co-workers and trainers harassed her based on the fact that she is African American. Complainant stated that UR informed her she would have problems at the beginning of her tenure because she is a black female. Complainant and several of her trainers stated that she was harassed during her training sessions and that her trainers were hostile towards her or did not want to train her. She relayed that she was in a training status for two and a half years during which she was constantly retested and subjected to abusive methods.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the placement of the initials "KKK" near complainant's work station computer as well as the discovery of a noose in her work station, on two occasions, clearly demonstrate racial animus and an intention to intimidate and to create a fearful atmosphere. As the Commission has stated, the presence of a hangman's noose evokes an image, particularly among African Americans, of extreme racial violence and a direct threat to life. <span class="Italic">Tootle v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40127 (Feb. 21, 2006). Even a single incident involving a hangman's noose is severe enough to alter the terms and conditions of one's employment and to create an abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">Posey v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01986619 (July 10, 2001); <span class="Italic">Tardd v. Brookhaven Nat'l. Lab.,</span> 407 F. Supp.2d 404, (E.D. N.Y. 2006) (employee wearing a KKK hood, a hangman's noose and a doll hanging in effigy on plaintiff's door sufficient to defeat a Federal Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss the hostile work environment claim).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the issue whether the agency took appropriate action in light of the actions of complainant's co-workers. In a case of co-worker harassment, an agency is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where the agency (or its agents) knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.ll(d). When an employer receives a complaint or otherwise learns of alleged harassment in the workplace, the employer should investigate promptly and thoroughly. The employer should take immediate and appropriate corrective action by doing whatever is necessary to end the harassment, make the victim whole by restoring lost employment benefits or opportunities, and prevent the misconduct from recurring.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disciplinary action against the offending supervisor or employee, ranging from reprimand to discharge, may be necessary. Generally, the corrective action should reflect the severity of the conduct.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that complainant first complained about racial harassment in a complaint filed before the agency's Accountability Board in October 2000. There is no documentary or testimonial evidence in the record reflecting the outcome of this particular complaint, aside from complainant's statement that the agency decided to resolve the complaint "in-house." According to UR, an investigation was made, however, there is no evidence that any additional action was taken to discipline any employees or to communicate that the conduct was unacceptable. From this we conclude that the agency failed to take any appropriate corrective actions to prevent future similar incidents from occurring. Thereafter, additional incidents occurred, in which complainant's co-workers continued to express their hostility towards her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant again reported the hostile work environment and reiterated a request for a transfer to the agency's Civil Rights Office in February 2003. In turn, the Civil Rights Office reported the discovery of a hangman's noose to the Accountability Board along with complainant's request for a transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency assigned the Manager of the Air Traffic Control Tower at Nashville (S2) to investigate the incident. The record discloses, however, that S2 did not investigate the presence of the hangman's noose, but instead, she examined complainant's and UR's use of the word "nigger." That is, UR had a conversation with complainant in which he referred to the hangman's noose as "like a hang a nigger noose, like Jim Crow." According to S2's written report, she found the incident to be a "non-issue." (ROI, Training records).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concludes that the agency's actions were inadequate to address the severe incidents of racial hostility being exhibited in its work place. There is no evidence the agency had a written policy directed towards preventing and reporting incidents of harassment in the work site or that it conveyed a policy to its employees. The record reflects no effort to investigate the report of a noose. We also find that the agency did not seriously investigate or take any corrective action surrounding the presence of "KKK" initials found at complainant's work station. Thus, there being no proof of prompt corrective and remedial actions in response to the reported racial hostility, the Commission concludes that the agency is liable for the hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Readers will find cases where the Commission has held that use of the term "nigger," while "deeply troubling," does not rise to the level of a Title VII violation where the complainant's conduct otherwise warrants discipline. <span class="Italic">See Theurer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911708 (1991). Under similar circumstances, in <span class="Italic">Ayuso v. Attorney General</span>, 01950345 (1997), the Commission held that the single use of the term "wetback" does not create hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Chauncey M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120173056 (2017) (though complainant took a manager's comment "don't get gangsta on me" as a racial slur, the Commission concluded that, while the phrase "could certainly be construed as offensive, particularly to an African American employee, by itself it is simply insufficiently severe or pervasive to state a valid hostile work environment claim."). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Glenn E. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120162412 (2018), the Commission held that a single instance of a coworker calling the Asian complainant a "Yakuza," a term that generally refers to Japanese gangster, was not so severe that it created a hostile work environment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Glenn E</span>. wrote, "we do not construe this reference as a type of 'highly charged epithet' that 'dredges up the entire history" oppression and bigotry,'" but cautioned the agency that it "should discourage such conduct through leadership, counseling and EEO training."</p>
<p class="noindent">Those isolated cases are outweighed by others where the Commission considers certain terms to have deep historical significance such that a single use can create a hostile environment. The Commission places heavy emphasis, in evaluating claims of hostile environment, on words or phrases that are historically racially charged. Slurs that have an historic connotation of racial discrimination can, in the Commission's opinion, legitimately make other neutral comments take on a racial overtone. For example, in <span class="Italic">Core v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960887 (1998), the supervisor admitted making a comment about being a "slave driver" to a black employee. In light of this comment, the Commission found that it was reasonable for the employee to perceive other comments, with no overt racial overtones, as being discriminatory. The supervisor also made a comment about already giving to charity when the employee asked for training and, on another occasion, inquired why the employee didn't go back to Haiti. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Core</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we first note that the statement "I wish I were a slave-driver" would be highly offensive to any reasonable person in appellant's position. Such a statement to two Black women talking on the job was clearly intended to reference and conjure up a dark time in our nation's history when Black people were enslaved and did not enjoy the legal status and protections of Caucasian individuals. That S1 intended his comment to motivate appellant and CW1 to stop talking and start working is immaterial<span class="Italic">. See Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co.</span>, 12 F.3d 668, 675 (7th Cir. 1993) (statement "you black guys are too f_ing dumb to be insurance agents," when offered by the supervisor to motivate them to work harder and smarter, evidenced a racially hostile environment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 also admitted to making the "charity" remark. Even though S1 did not believe his comment to be racially derogatory, we find that a reasonable person in appellant's position, having heard S1 previously utter racially derogatory remarks, would have perceived the statement to be racially derogatory. Additionally, in as much as the AJ did not discredit appellant's testimony, and further, that S1 admitted to the "slave-driver" and "charity" remarks, we find that, more likely than not, S1 made all the statements attributed to him by appellant. In this respect, we note some of these remarks evidence clear racial animus, such as the "Haiti" remarks. other remarks, though on their face race-neutral, were arguably harassing and also contributed to a racially hostile environment. As the Third Circuit observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Discrimination continues to pollute the social and economic mainstream of American life, and is often simply masked in more subtle forms. It has become easier to coat various forms of discrimination with the appearance of propriety, or to ascribe some other less odious intention to what is in reality discriminatory behavior. In other words, while discriminatory conduct persists, violators have learned not to leave the proverbial "smoking gun" behind.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same is true of harassment based on race. While the other remarks attributed to S1 do not, in and of themselves, indicate racial animus, taken together with other racially derogatory remarks uttered by S1, a reasonable person in appellant's position would perceive S1's continuous statements to be racially derogatory, abusive and harassing. Additionally, M1's action with respect to the magazine and "you people" comment the day following S1's "charity" comment further contributed to the racially hostile environment. While the testimony as to what occurred on March 23, 1994, is contradictory, appellant's testimony that M1 made the "you people" statement appears to be partially corroborated by S2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that more likely than not, M1 did utter the entire "you people" statement as appellant alleged. We also note that CW2 and FE1 both indicated that there was animus exhibited toward appellant, and further, that FE1 believed the animus to be racially motivated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the existing atmosphere at the Ranchland facility, a reasonable person in appellant's position would have perceived M1's act, and his "you people" statement to be racially derogatory. In this case, it was the proverbial straw that broke appellant's back, and she was, shortly thereafter, hospitalized and treated for, among other things, severe stress at work. Viewing the atmosphere at the Ranchland facility as a whole, <span id="Page_935"></span>we conclude that appellant established that the offensive and abusive statements made by S1 and M1 were sufficiently patterned and pervasive so as to constitute a hostile work environment on the basis of race.</p>

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>, 0120122591 (2015) (single incident of supervisor telling complainant to stop complaining in front of coworkers because he could be perceived as a "scary Black man," even if it occurred, was "troubling" but not sufficiently sever and pervasive). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120100759 (2010) (allegation that contract employee referred to black female complaint as a monkey on several occasions stated a hostile environment claim); <span class="Italic">Parnell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05120100031 (2009) (coworker allegedly calling complainant's granddaughter a "big, fat monkey" stated claim for relief).</p>
<p class="noindent">Exposing an employee to media criticism can lead to a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0720130030 (2014), the Commission also found that the agency had not taken prompt and effective action to stop the harassing conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that, although the AJ analyzed this matter under a disparate treatment theory, we find that Complainant's allegations are more properly addressed as a hostile work environment/harassment case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment of an employee that would not occur but for the employee's race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, religion or prior EEO activity is unlawful, if it is sufficiently patterned or pervasive. <span class="Italic">Wibstad v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01972699 (Aug. 14, 1998) (citing <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138-39 (D.C. Cir. 1985)); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., at 3, 9 (Mar. 8, 1994). A single incident or group of isolated incidents will not be regarded as discriminatory harassment unless the conduct is severe. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co</span>., 684 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir. 1982). Whether the harassment is sufficiently severe to trigger a violation of Title VII must be determined by looking at all the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems</span>, 510 U.S. 17 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a claim of hostile environment harassment, Complainant must show that: (1) he is a member of a statutorily protected class; (2) he was subjected to harassment in the form of unwelcome verbal or physical conduct involving the protected class; (3) the harassment complained of was based on the statutorily protected class; (4) the harassment affected a term or condition of employment and/or had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the work environment and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment: and (5) there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer, <span class="Italic">See Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the Agency's actions were based on Complainant's race in the form of unwelcome verbal conduct. Although the Agency maintains that no employee leaked information about Complainant to the media, we note that employees believed that the DMC was responsible for the leaks. Testimony reflects that the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management believed that the DMC was Fraud Buster. Also, the Director of Diversity Programs testified that there were "strong indications" that the DMC was responsible for the leaks, and that "there were conversations with [management], with every indication that it was [the DMC]" who was responsible. Further, although the DMC herself testified that she had never received or reviewed the e-mails from Fraud Buster, she continued to accuse the ARRA Director of some of the same ethical violations. Specifically, the DMC, similar to Fraud Buster's email, testified:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[The ARRA] made it very clear that she first had come down here to give $9 million to [a Congressman's] historical black--nine historical black colleges, and that we, the site, were not working towards making [the Congressman] happy.... [S]o she directed that four more job fairs be conducted and set in [the Congressman's] districts, which are at a minimum two hours away from the site.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Identically, FB's e-mail dated September 7, 2009, also accused the ARRA Director of misappropriating $9 million in ARRA funding for a Historically Black University. Therein, FB also implicated Complainant, noting that he was also responsible for the hiring of minorities. In the DMC's testimony, she continued to assert that the ARRA Director and Complainant acted improperly despite the fact that the IG's investigation found nothing but dysfunction and a concern about allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also point out that the DMC's testimony reflects that she had personal knowledge of the names of employees who worked for one media publication and was comfortable calling them by phone, asking them to keep certain conversations "off the record." Also, the employee whom the DMC contacted for the publication was the same employee FB addressed in e-mails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the record supports a finding that the DMC was in fact Fraud Buster, responsible for disseminating the information about Complainant and the ARRA Director to the press and throughout the Agency. Given the e-mail dated September 7, 2009, discussing monies to Historically Black Universities, diversity, and the hiring of minorities. it is clear that the DMC's actions as the Fraud Buster were based on Complainant's and the ARRA's Director's protected status as African-American employees. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established the first three prongs of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Objectively Hostile or Abusive Work Environment</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning now to the fourth prong, we note that whether or not an objectively hostile or abusive work environment exists is based on whether a reasonable person in complainant's circumstances would have found the alleged behavior to be hostile or abusive. The incidents must have been "sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 17, 21; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, 523 U.S. 75 (1998). To ascertain this, we look at the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; whether it was hostile or patently offensive; whether the alleged harasser was a co-worker or a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 17, 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the DMC's conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of Complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment. We find that a reasonable person would find that the cumulative effect of the DMC's actions created a hostile work environment. First, we note that the DMC through her Fraud Buster alias sent the e-mail dated September 7, 2009, implicating Complainant for unethical behavior for the hiring of minorities, among other inflammatory assertions. Second, due to the DMC's actions, Complainant's name and picture were published in the media, accusing him of unethical conduct. Through the DMC, media publications wrote that Complainant and the ARRA Director were engaged in unprofessional behavior and abused their positions looking for "greed and power." Notwithstanding the Agency's assertions on appeal, other than the DMC's testimony, there is absolutely no evidence in the record that Complainant acted unethically in the performance of his duties. Complainant's career and reputation were clearly affected by the DMC's actions; namely, Complainant and the ARRA Director were later apparently told that they could no longer be managers at the SRS due to the articles written about them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, as a result of the DMC's allegations as Fraud Buster, the IG opened an investigation. Instead of finding that the allegations levied against Complainant and the ARRA Director were true, the IG found, as noted above, that witnesses described coworkers in derogatory terms with issues of racism and reverse discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth, we note that, during the hearing, employees testified that the SRS has historically, for years, had a culture of subjecting African-American employees to extreme bigotry, including highly charged racial epithets (the n-word) and highly charged derogatory symbols of discrimination. Specifically, the Director of the Office of Human Capital (DOHC) (African-American) testified during the hearing that a consultant came to the <span id="Page_936"></span>SRS to do a culture assessment. The DOHC testified that the consultant revealed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Savannah River site was characterized as a plantation with masters, overseers, house slaves and field slaves. The house slaves have perks that are denied to field slaves.... These comments and perceptions that were shared by the consultant, I happen to have been in the meeting when they were shared, were immediately discounted and there was no follow-up meetings....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The DOHC further testified that other employees came to him, complaining about being treated in a disparate manner. The DOHC felt that he, himself, had also been treated in an unethical, disparate, and unprofessional manner as well. The DOHC also testified that he left the SRS because his mid-year and year-end reviews did not reflect his accomplishments and he did not his reputation to be tarnished.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the ARRA Director described the SRS as a "racial hell hole," testifying that "Savannah River has been a place of racial discrimination and racism for years." The ARRA Director testified:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]hey have had nooses that was hung out [sic]. They had the N-word on several areas at the Savannah River Site. They had one Savannah River employee, a DOE employee, who wanted the Confederate flag displayed in his office. Went around asking, could we sign up for Confederate Day, or having a Confederate celebration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that Complainant has met the fourth prong, establishing an objectively hostile or abusive work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Liability</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant has established that he was subjected to racial harassment, we must finally examine whether Agency is liable for the harassing actions. This is a case of coworker harassment, and in the case of coworker harassment, an agency is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where the agency (or its agents) knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can be shown that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). An agency can raise an affirmative defense when it shows that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What is appropriate remedial action will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, such as the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, there is no dispute that many different levels of management employees and the local surrounding community were aware of the e-mails and public articles implicating Complainant. Even after Complainant and other coworkers complained, leaks to the media about Complainant continued from within the SRS senior management team (the DMC) with little or almost no effort to stop them. Although there is some testimony in the record that there may have been an investigation into the leaks, the record is unclear as to the extent of it and who performed it. We note that most, if not all, of the testimony about any such investigation into the leaks came from the DMC herself, who as noted above, was the one actually responsible for the leaks. We find that the DMC's testimony about any such investigation into the leaks is not credible based on record. We note that the DMC testified to the as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q: Did the [Agency] ever investigate who was leaking e-mails to the press?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A: Yes, the [A]ssistant [S]ecretary requested that our security people, who had the IT, you know, the IT, the communications database, that they go back through the archives of all the e-mails....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Yet, we note the Agency's Headquarters' Associate Director for Diversity testified differently, saying that a forensic investigation in fact had not been done. The Director testified:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q: ...[D]o you know if the forensic analysis was in fact done at Savannah River to determine who was...leaking information to the media?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A: One was not done, that I'm aware of.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Associate Director for Diversity also testified to the effect that Agency Headquarters, on the advice of its Office of General Counsel, determined that it should not get involved in this matter. The Director for Diversity further testified as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The office of general counsel at the Department of Energy Headquarters, and the office of inspector general, [said] that they shouldn't engage in this because it would perhaps chill the environment.... And so, you know, whoever was doing this was given free rein to continue to do it and against the, you know, of us who knew that they could address it, and so...they chose not to do anything.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's Headquarters' IT cyber security employee testified that her office is generally responsible for conducting such forensic investigations, but she was not asked to get involved here and was told that an investigation had already been done. Yet the IT cyber security employee testified that she never received a copy of any forensics report which named the person responsible for the leaks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that employees strongly believed that the leaks were coming from inside the SRS senior management team, in particular from the DMC. We note that when C1 was irritated about having his conversations leaked, the DMC quickly attempted to rectify the situation by directly phoning certain employees at the media outlet, with whom the DMC was coincidentally familiar. It is clear that, although there was an investigation conducted by the Agency's IG focusing on whether the ARRA Director and Complainant engaged in misconduct, there was no sufficient investigation or action by the Agency to stop the leaks against them even though it apparently was common knowledge that it was the DMC who was responsible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, based on the above, we find that the Agency failed to immediately and effectively address the DMC's harassment of Complainant despite the public nature of the harassment in this case. The Agency's headquarters and various management employees were aware of the harassment, yet no sufficient action was taken to stop or discipline the DMC even though it likely was known that she was responsible. We find that the Agency's response here is inadequate, and its failure to promptly and appropriately address this matter conveyed the message that Complainant could be intimidated with impunity, and that the Agency did not take racial harassment seriously. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091468 (Aug. 31, 2012). Accordingly, we find the Agency liable for the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that predated compensatory damages as a remedy, the Commission found that the fact that no direct relief can be granted to the employee does not remove racial slurs from the ambit of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 01832914 (1987), stated the law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under our Regulations, agencies are responsible for maintaining a work atmosphere free of racial or ethnic slurs. While an individual offended by such slurs may not be entitled to damages under the Act, agencies are nevertheless obligated to provide employees with a work atmosphere free of racially/sexually/ethnically/religiously derogatory comments or slurs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the actionability of the use of epithets depends on the circumstances, Courts have begun to recognize that ethnic slurs in the context of the employment situation are not "mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities." The facts of this case display a contempt for racial minorities which was crudely and openly proclaimed to a meeting of more than twenty agency employees. The subsequent explanation reveals an even more invidious prejudice. If the statements were merely part of a casual conversation, then the Commission might find that a public apology and appropriate disciplinary action would be sufficient. However the use of the term "nigger," justified first as Texas slang and then admitted to be a poor choice of words for a term to convey the idea of a "person who disrespects all laws," moves the matter beyond inactionable ethnic/racial/sexual/religious slur emanating from casual conversation. Accordingly, we conclude that appellant's complaint states a cause of action within the purview of our regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We make this finding because it is settled that where an EEO complaint contains a set of facts that if found to be true upon an investigation, would constitute a violation of Title VII, the agency is obligated to investigate the complaint and make a determination regardless of the appropriateness or the availability of the relief requested by the complainant. This is true even where a complainant may not be entitled to damages or to obtain any measure of disciplinary action against an alleged discriminating official as part of the make-whole relief available under Title VII....</p>
