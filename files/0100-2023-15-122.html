<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-120"><span class="space">E.</span> DISCOVERY SANCTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Over the years, the Commission has become far more aggressive in imposing sanctions against both agencies and complainants. Sanctions have been imposed for failure to conduct timely and adequate investigations, dilatory discovery conduct, destruction of documents and conduct by agency counsel that interferes with a neutral investigation. Because sanctions can be imposed for several distinct kinds of conduct, the issue of sanctions is covered in several section of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. Sanctions for inadequate investigations are covered in Chapter 4 in section on "<a href="0100-2023-13-029.html#sec4-29">Inadequate Investigations</a>." Sanctions for destruction of documents and contumacious conduct are covered in Chapter 8 in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-17-058.html#sec8-59">Review of Sanctions</a>." Sanctions for interference with the EEO process by counsel are covered in Chapter 9 in section on "<a href="0100-2023-18-003.html#sec9-4">Role of the Agency Representative</a>." Discussed below are sanctions for dilatory discovery conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Aside from the issue of who should pay the costs for supplementing the record when the agency conducted an inadequate investigation is the issue of who should pay when it is necessary to pursue motions to compel discovery because of a party's refusal to respond to discovery. In the last few years, the Commission had taken a progressively tougher stance on dilatory discovery practices. With more and more frequency, such practices resulted in sanctions against the offending party. The Commission held that it had the authority to impose sanctions, such as awarding the complainant attorney fees, even in cases where the complainant is not the prevailing party on the merits of the underlying claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Salter v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01993997 (2000) (awarding a nonprevailing complainant fees and costs incurred during discovery was appropriate where agency failed to comply with discovery request.).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission became increasingly aggressive in awarding attorney fees to complainants as a sanction against dilatory discovery conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortega v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956818 (1998); <span class="Italic">Comer v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 05940649 (1996). A discussion of attorney fees as a discovery sanction is also included in <a href="0100-2023-31-001.html#sec22-1">Chapter 22</a>. Discovery misconduct is not the only conduct which can cause an administrative judge to impose sanctions. Other conduct that can warrant sanctions is discussed in Chapter 8 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-17-058.html#sec8-59">Review of Sanctions</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In January 2003, however, the Commission's practice of imposing an award of attorney fees as a sanction against agencies came to a halt when the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, found that sovereign immunity barred the EEOC from using attorney fees as a sanction against agencies. For the next few years, the Commission instructed its administrative judges not to issue such sanctions while it reviewed the Justice Department memorandum and decided what, if anything, to do about it. That hiatus came to a halt in May 2007 when the Commission issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Waller v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720030069 (2007), rejecting the Justice Department rationale. Both the Justice Department memorandum and the <span class="Italic">Waller</span> decision are discussed fully below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Merit Systems Protection Board has long had a practice of imposing sanctions on a party for discovery misconduct only if the opposing party has filed a motion to compel discovery, which was granted, and the responding party failed to comply with the order compelling discovery. In other words, the Board never directly imposes sanctions for the dilatory discovery conduct itself; it only imposes sanctions for violations of the judge's order compelling discovery. This practice may discourage parties from violating orders of the Board's administrative judges, but it does nothing to discourage dilatory discovery conduct. The EEOC has taken a markedly different approach that is consistent with the approach of the federal district courts and more and more state courts. The EEOC does not require that the judge issue an order compelling discovery prior to the imposition of sanctions. The Commission will directly sanction dilatory discovery conduct, if sanctions are appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Failing to respond to a discovery request should never be an option. A complete failure to respond, even if it does not invoke sanctions, places a party on poor footing with the administrative judge who will ultimately decide the case. In some cases, the discovery request is objectionable and the Commission accounts for this fact in listing the filing of objections as a discovery response. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 7-24. When a party objects to the requested discovery, the response should indicate the nature of the objection, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the request is irrelevant, overly burdensome, or seeks privileged information. Blanket objections, where the same laundry list of objections is asserted for each discovery request, are looked upon with disfavor. Each discovery request should be assessed individually to determine if legitimate objections apply.</p>
<p class="noindent">Filing objections to discovery or a motion for a protective order is a defense to the imposition of sanctions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01A02919 (2000), the Commission found the administrative judge improperly levied sanctions against the complainant where the judge never ruled on his motion for a protective order. In the absence of a ruling on the motion, sanctions were improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many times, discovery disputes can be resolved between the parties without involving the administrative judge. For example, if an agency believes a request for production of documents is overly broad, the complainant may agree to narrow the scope of the request while still obtaining the relevant documents. Voluntary resolution of discovery disputes must at least be explored before filing a motion to compel discovery. Moreover, the Commission requires that, as a prerequisite to filing a motion to compel, the party seeking the discovery certify that he or she has "conferred with the opposing party, or made a good faith effort to do so, to attempt to resolve the discovery dispute." MD-110 at 7-24.</p>
<p class="noindent">The range of possible sanctions for failure to respond to discovery is set forth at 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the complainant, or the agency against which a complaint is filed, or its employees fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to an order of an administrative judge, or requests for the investigative file, for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es), the administrative judge shall, in appropriate circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information;</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_502"></span>(ii)&#x2003;Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iv)&#x2003;Issue a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(v)&#x2003;Take such other actions as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's tougher stance on dilatory discovery conduct started in <span class="Italic">Dowell v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01961681 (1997), where the Commission stated that the agency may have to bear the costs of discovery prior to a hearing if the agency failed to provide an adequate factual record during the investigative stage. In that case, the employee filed a second complaint alleging that the agency's failure to appoint an investigator to his first complaint within 180 days constituted reprisal for protected activity. Although the Commission upheld the agency's dismissal of the second complaint for failure to state a claim, it also opined in <span class="Italic">Dowell</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency was required to notify appellant that it had completed its investigation of his complaint with 180 days of the date that the complaint was filed. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.108(f). In the absence of the required notice, appellant may request a hearing at any time after 180 days has elapsed from the filing of the complaint<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In this case, it is quite clear from the record that the agency never even bothered to assign an investigator to the matter, let alone complete the investigation within 180 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We would advise appellant to request a hearing in connection with Complaint No. 95-1070, in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.108(f). Although the parties are generally required to bear their own discovery costs, the agency may be required to bear all of the costs of discovery if it failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the complaint. EEO MD-110, p. 6-16 (1992). Should the administrative judge determine that the agency failed to provide an adequate factual record, he may issue an order requiring the agency to bear the costs of any necessary discovery, in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3)(v)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed above, the Commission has now singled out the issue of costs for inadequate investigations and deals with that separately.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on a separate section of the 1992 version of MD-110, in <span class="Italic">Comer v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,</span> 05940649 (1996), the Commission held that an administrative judge does have the authority to impose economic sanctions against an agency that exhibits bad faith in failing to respond to discovery requests. In <span class="Italic">Comer</span>, the agency failed to produce witnesses for deposition. The Commission held, in <span class="Italic">Comer</span>, that not only was the agency responsible for the actual costs of the missed depositions, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the court reporter's attendance fee, but it also was responsible for paying attorney fees incurred because of the agency's bad faith:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Record evidence shows that the agency failed to appear for properly scheduled depositions. A review of the AJ's May 5, 1993 Order shows that appellant filed a Motion to Compel Depositions and for the Issuance of Sanctions on April 28, 1993; that the agency filed a Response on May 3, 1993; and, that appellant filed a Second Motion to Compel Depositions and Request for Sanctions on May 3, 1993. The record also contains appellant's May 4, 1993 Motion for the Issuance of Sanctions, which is not addressed in the AJ's May 5, 1993 Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her Order, the AJ noted that correspondence attached to the various motions indicated that appellant's counsel attempted to contact the agency and arrange for depositions, and that the agency failed to respond in a timely manner, including failing to appear rather than timely contacting appellant's attorney to reschedule the properly noticed depositions. For example, the record contains an affidavit from appellant's attorney stating that on April 27, 1993, he noticed the deposition of two witnesses (agency employees) for May 3, 1993. The attorney testified that although the agency did not inform him at any time that it did not intend to appear for the depositions, the agency failed to appear for the noticed-depositions on May 3, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the AJ found that the agency's refusal to contact appellant's counsel in a timely manner constituted bad faith, she nonetheless concluded that she was not authorized to issue monetary sanctions. The AJ noted, however, that under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(iii), she was able to exclude evidence offered by the party failing to produce the witness. Consequently, the AJ advised the agency that if it failed to produce the approved witnesses for a deposition at a time mutually agreed to by the parties prior to the hearing, she would exclude the testimony of those witnesses at the hearing. The AJ further advised that she would not give any weight to the affidavits of those witnesses in making her recommended decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant asked that the Commission issue an Order compelling the agency to compensate her for the expenses and attorney fees which she incurred from its bad faith conduct, irrespective of its decision on the merits of her complaint. Appellant did not challenge the AJ's decision not to take other action against the agency as permitted by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the AJ erred in concluding that she was not authorized to issue sanctions, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to order the agency to reimburse her costs, for the agency's discovery abuses. EEOC Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (MD-110) identifies 3 instances when an EEOC AJ may impose sanctions on a party:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1)&#x2003;if the AJ determines that an investigation is inadequate and incomplete because of the agency's failure to complete the investigation within the time limits set forth in &#x00A7; 1614.108 (e) and the agency has not cooperated in the discovery process as required by &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3), <span class="Italic">see</span> MD-110 at 6-5 &#x0026; 6-6;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2)&#x2003;if a party fails to comply without good cause with rulings on requests for information, documents, or admissions, where the information is solely in the control of that party; or, if a party fails to provide an adequate explanation for the failure to respond fully and in a timely manner to a request and the information is solely in the control of that party, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 6-7; and,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3)&#x2003;if a party fails to appear at a properly scheduled deposition, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 6-11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109 (3)(d), and MD-110 enumerate the actions that an EEOC AJ may take in the above-described circumstances, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, exclude other evidence offered by the party refusing to produce the requested information, enter a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party, and so forth.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Record evidence showed that the agency failed to appear for properly scheduled depositions. MD-110 states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A failure to appear at a properly scheduled deposition may result in the non-appearing party bearing the cost of the missed session. For purposes of this section, any employee or former employee of the agency currently employed by the Federal government is a party. Agencies must make such persons available for depositions and such depositions shall be taken on official time. The agency may be liable for costs incurred if such persons are not made available on the clock for depositions or other discovery or if such persons fail to appear.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6-11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ erred in concluding that she was not authorized to order the agency to reimburse appellant for costs resulting from the agency's bad faith conduct. To the extent that appellant incurred costs (including attorney's fees) as a result of the agency's bad faith conduct, appellant may submit to the agency an itemized list of those costs. The agency is ordered to reimburse appellant for her costs<span class="Italic">. See generally Stull v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942827 (June 15, 1995) (attorney's fees incurred as a result of the agency's failure to comply with the AJ's discovery order).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ortega v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956818 (1998) (awarding fees as sanction).</p>
<p class="noindent">In deciding whether to impose a sanction, the administrative judge must consider whether the offending conduct actually warrants the imposition of a sanction and, if so, determine what sanction would be appropriate. The decision to impose sanctions is premised on a party's failure to establish good cause for its conduct. Whether the opposing party is prejudiced by that conduct or whether the conduct was in bad faith goes to the level of sanction that should be imposed. As the Commission explains in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 6-1:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge's authority to issue sanctions is set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). Additional guidance can be found in EEO MD-110, 7-9 and Rules 11 and 37 of the <span class="Italic">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</span>. In appropriate circumstances, an Administrative Judge may sanction a party for its conduct. Sanctions should be tailored to deter the party from similar conduct in the future and, if warranted, to equitably remedy any harm incurred by the opposing party. Sanctions should not be so severe that they result in inequity, nor should they be so lenient that they fail to serve as a deterrent. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, it may constitute an abuse of discretion to impose a harsher sanction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). Administrative Judges must distinguish between conduct that does not warrant the imposition of a sanction and conduct which does. For example, a complainant's failure to submit a Designation of Representative Form or failure to respond to a notice of the Administrative Judge's intent to issue a decision without a hearing is not the type of conduct which an Administrative Judge should sanction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, a party's failure to obey an Administrative Judge's order to produce a document during discovery or to expedite an investigation may be cause for a sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Administrative Judge's discretion to issue sanctions is premised on a party's failure to show good cause for the conduct at issue. There is no requirement to show that the other party was "substantially prejudiced" or that the non-complying party exhibited bad faith, although such a showing may be a factor in an Administrative Judge's determination of <span id="Page_503"></span>the appropriate sanction. <span class="Italic">See Cornell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (November 24, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Administrative Judges should consider whether the conduct at issue constitutes an attack on the integrity of the EEO process. In such a situation, a sufficiently severe sanction is appropriate. For example, where an agency repeatedly fails to comply with an Administrative Judge's order to complete an expedited investigation, the Administrative Judge could issue a decision in favor of the complainant as a sanction. <span class="Italic">See DaCosta v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining the proper sanction to impose for failure to comply with discovery requests and orders, the sanction should "both deter[s] the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to [provide an] equitably remedy the opposing party." <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994888 (2001) (a sanction precluding the agency from presenting evidence on issues was proper where the agency did not timely investigate claims and failed to respond to discovery orders). See also <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In awarding fees as a sanction, the administrative judge could take into consideration the nature and volume of the discovery requests. For example, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01973566 (1999), the complainant requested over $43,000 in fees as a sanction for dilatory discovery conduct and the administrative judge awarded slightly under $6,500. In upholding the award, the Commission noted that the judge balanced the agency's dilatory conduct with the substantial nature of the complainant's discovery requests.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the administrative judge issued a recommended decision awarding discovery costs to the complainant, the agency was bound by that decision if it failed to issue a final decision within 60 days. In that event, all aspects of the recommended decision become final, including any findings related to discovery costs. <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01956593 (1997). Presumably, the same principle applied under the 1999 amendments and an agency's failure to issue a final action declining to fully implement the decision of an administrative judge would bar any challenge to sanctions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission cannot use attorney fees as a sanction against complainants for discovery misconduct. It can, however, impose any of the other sanctions set forth in 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3). It can also dismiss a complainant's case for failure to cooperate.</p>
