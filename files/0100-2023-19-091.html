<h2 class="h2" id="sec10-84"><span class="space">IV.</span> DIRECT EVIDENCE and "MIXED MOTIVE" CASES</h2>
<p class="noindent">As discussed above, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis was designed to apply in cases where there only is circumstantial evidence of intent. Indeed, the entire premise of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that in most cases there will be no direct evidence of intent. Still, there are cases where there is direct evidence of intent and these cases are analyzed differently than cases involving circumstantial evidence. In direct evidence cases, there is no need to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination is a device created to establish a rebuttable presumption of discrimination; that is, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination consists of those facts which, if otherwise left unexplained, would allow a factfinder to infer a discriminatory motive. In a direct evidence case, there is no need to infer a discriminatory motive. The issue in a direct evidence case simply becomes whether the complainant's evidence of intent is sufficient to warrant a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two closely related questions that arise in a direct evidence case. The first is what burden of proof to apply to the complainant's direct evidence in order to establish a discriminatory motive. This is a straight-forward question with a straight-forward answer: a complainant must establish the employer's discriminatory motive by a preponderance of the evidence. This is the same burden of proof applied in circumstantial evidence cases. The second question that arises is what happens when the employer, as it invariably will, asserts that it also was motivated by legitimate reasons and that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. This question has a less straight-forward answer: most courts have found that the employer must prove it would have taken the same action, for legitimate reasons, by a preponderance of the evidence, but the EEOC applies a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Kathryn K. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120131314 (2015) ("Once a Complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the Agency's action, it is the Agency's burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor."); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120090633 (2011) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">The employer's burden in a direct evidence or mixed motive case often, however, is confused with a slightly different situation. The direct evidence analysis only applies at the liability stage of a case. In other words, the direct evidence analysis applies when the question is whether the employer should be held liable under Title VII. A separate, though closely aligned defense, can be presented at the relief stage of a proceeding. Once again, the employer can assert that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. However, in this scenario the employer does not contend that it actually was motivated, in part, by legitimate reasons. Instead, the employer is asserting that it could have achieved the same results for legitimate reasons--reasons of which it usually was unaware at the time of the personnel action. As discussed more fully, there has been no easy answer to the proper analysis to apply to such a situation. The courts and the Commission have taken conflicting and confusing stands on the issue. Some courts have applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to such cases; other courts and the Commission have applied a clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the issue of what burdens of proof to apply to an employer at the liability and relief stages of a proceeding are distinct questions, they are addressed in separate sections of this chapter. However, the reader is cautioned that a full understanding of either issue depends on a solid understanding of both issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">Three decisions of the Supreme Court, the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and the Commission's regulations at Part 1614 have all had an impact on the burdens of proof, as well as the level of confusion. From the Commission's perspective, the current state of affairs is that where an agency asserts that it could have taken the same action even absent discrimination, it must demonstrate this fact by clear and convincing evidence. If the agency asserts that it was actually motivated by legitimate reasons in addition to discriminatory reasons, it must demonstrate this fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Carr v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05950651 (1997). Note that the distinction being made here is that in one instance an agency is asserting that even though its action was discriminatory, it would have acted in the same fashion even if discrimination had not been involved. To a large extent, the agency is requesting the factfinder to engage in speculation about what would have happened in the absence of discrimination. In a mixed motive case, the agency is asserting that it was simultaneously motivated by discriminatory and nondiscriminatory reasons. The distinction, although difficult to make, is important because it relates to the proper burden of proof that is placed on an agency and also to the relief available to the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order for the mixed motive analysis to apply, both the legitimate and nonlegitimate reasons must be operating at the time of the agency's action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sharp v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A40755 (2005), the Commission found that the administrative judge erred in applying the mixed motive analysis where the agency relied in part on the results of an examination that was not taken until nearly a year after the complainant's request for reinstatement was denied. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120122878 (2015), the Commission found that the agency supervisor who engaged in religious discrimination would have recommended the removal of the complainant even absent discrimination where performance problems were documented prior to the discrimination, and the complainant had been placed on PIP by a different supervisor prior to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In early cases, the Commission held that once the employee demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's action was based on prohibited discrimination, the agency still may escape liability if it can establish, through clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action even absent prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sparacino v. Department of Army</span>, 01852815 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Day v. Matthews</span>, 530 F.2d 1083 (D.C. Cir. 1976)); <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01840855 (1986) (citing 29 CFR 1613.271(a)(2)). Unlike the agency's burden of production, its burden to show that the employee was not affected adversely by prohibited discrimination is a burden of persuasion, not production. The clear and convincing burden of proof standard was applied only in situations where it was found that the agency had discriminated against appellant and the question was one of remedy. As a general rule, a victim of discrimination is entitled to be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position he or she would have been in but for the prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975). A victim of discrimination is not entitled to be placed in a better position that he or she would have been in but for the discrimination. As a result, a demonstration by the agency that it would have taken the disputed personnel action even in the absence of discrimination will affect the remedy available to that complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant presents direct evidence of a discriminatory intent, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis is inapplicable. When direct evidence of discrimination is presented, the Commission essentially requires the agency to rebut such evidence by establishing that the agency would have made the same decision even absent discrimination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Gauthier v. Department of Energy</span>, 01840179 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Bell v. Birmingham Linen Service</span>, 715 F.2d 1552 (11th Cir. 1983)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Bell</span> Court states, "[i]t would be illogical, indeed ironic. . .to allow a defendant to meet that direct proof [of discrimination] by merely articulating, but not proving, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action." The Court went on to state that where direct testimony and proof that a discriminatory motive was a "significant or substantial factor in an employment decision," the employer can only rebut the presumption of discrimination by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer would have made the same employment decision even absent the biased consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission then adopted the "mixed motives" analysis of <span class="Italic">Bibbs v. Block</span>, 778 F.2d 1318, <span class="Italic">appeal after remand</span> 850 F.2d 457, <span class="Italic">reh'g</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span> (8th Cir. 1988). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gauthier</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In such a "mixed motives" situation, we believe the analysis is best aided by separating the issues of liability and remedy. . . .The Court in <span class="Italic">Bibbs</span> stated,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[O]nce a plaintiff has established a violation of Title VII by proving that an unlawful motive played some part in the employment decision. . .the plaintiff is entitled to relief. . . .However, even after a finding of unlawful discrimination is made, the defendant is allowed further defense in order to limit relief. The defendant may avoid an award of reinstatement or promotion and backpay if it can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff would not have been hired or promoted even if the absence of proven discrimination. . . ."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Bibbs</span>, every kind of disadvantage resulting from racial prejudice in the employment setting is outlawed. Forcing appellant to be considered for a promotion in a process in which race plays a "discernible" role is itself a violation of the law, "regardless of the outcome of the process."</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that there was a split in the courts as to the allocation of the burden of proof in mixed motive cases, in <span class="Italic">Fleckner v. USPS</span>, 01862653 (1987), the Commission assumed, without deciding, that the burden rests on the agency to show that the action would have taken place even absent discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that the complainant then attempt to show pretext because that issue is resolved by requiring the agency to prove that its proffered reasons are the real reasons for its actions. Note that the proper burden for rebutting direct evidence of discrimination is a preponderance of the evidence. This is precisely the same burden borne by the complainant relying upon direct evidence. Essentially, in such a case, the ultimate result is dependent upon whose version of the evidence the factfinder believes.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, when a selection process utilizes a screening panel and one member is found to be biased, that does not necessarily mean the <span id="Page_752"></span>complainant will prevail. The agency may show the complainant would not have been selected even absent discriminatory bias by demonstrating that the other panel members were not biased and were not influenced by the biased member. <span class="Italic">Jontz v. Department of Navy</span>, 01862416 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Gleason v. Attorney General</span>, 01900612 (1990), the Commission further explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the agency determine[s] that unlawful consideration of sex entered into its deliberations, its burden [becomes] one of showing that sex was <span class="Italic">not</span> a factor in appellant's non-selection. This burden entails more than a reiteration of facts or conclusions which, in a discrimination free atmosphere, would justify nonselection. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">If further information is needed to determine in the final agency decision whether the agency would have nonselected the appellant even absent discrimination, the burden to produce that evidence is on the agency. There is no burden placed upon the appellant to produce any evidence, or even to request that it be produced. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lockhart v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01911775 (1992), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that if it found discrimination, the agency should be given an additional opportunity to show that it would not have selected the complainant for a promotion even in the absence of discrimination. The Commission noted that the agency had an opportunity to present such evidence both during the investigation and at the hearing, but had not done so. The proper remedy, the Commission held, was to award the complainant one of the denied promotions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Former regulations provided that the clear and convincing evidence standard would be applied where discrimination was found to have occurred, but the agency contended it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.271(c)(2). Still, the Commission was not always consistent and, at times, has applied a preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">If there is insufficient direct evidence to warrant a finding of discrimination, the case must then be analyzed using the circumstantial evidence model of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. The evidence of intent is analyzed along with other evidence of pretext. <span class="Italic">Christian-Harper v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01972786 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">The easiest way to understand the present state of the law is by understanding how the law evolved. That discussion starts with <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, moves to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and culminates in the discussion of <span class="Italic">Desert Palace</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed more fully in <a href="0100-2023-25-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>, the mixed motive analysis does not apply to cases under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.</span>, 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009).</p>
