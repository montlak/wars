<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-49"><span class="space">2.</span> Agency Advice and Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Numerous instances arise where a complainant alleges that the reason for the untimely initiation of counseling is that the agency provided errant advice on his or her rights. In some instances, the complainant alleges that provision of the errant advice was deliberate; in other instances, the agency official giving the advice was simply mistaken or uninformed.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency gives a potential complainant errant advice about starting the EEO process, this constitutes sufficient grounds for waiving the time period for counselor contact. The complainant must do more than allege that the agency misled her. She must present some form of proof as to the agency's actions. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01A1116 (2002) ("mere assertion is insufficient because the Commission requires more than a bald assertion of agency misconduct..."). However, once the complainant comes forward with some evidence, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate that counselor contact is untimely. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720070080 (2007), and cases cited therein. In <span class="Italic">Clarke</span>, the Commission found that the agency failed to meet its burden where the complainant testified that he withdrew his request for counseling after a lengthy conversation with his supervisor to the effect that his EEO complaint would hurt his chances for promotion, had disappointed and perplexed management, and would cause dissension within the office. In reversing a summary judgment decision in favor of the agency on the basis of untimely counselor contact, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Clarke</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that on May 7, 2002, he was called by his supervisor at home and told he wanted to talk to him about the EEO claim. According to complainant, when he replied that he could not talk because he was putting his daughter to bed, the supervisor said he really needed to talk to him badly before he did anything stupid. While the supervisor acknowledged that he had already learned of the EEO contact, he testified that he did not think he raised the EEO claim, and did not know what he said about stupid. Investigative Transcript (IR), Vol I, p. 122.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claimed that on May 8, 2002, while at an off-site meeting, his supervisor showed up and asked him to go talk in the supervisor's car. Complainant claimed that during this approximately two hour conversation, the supervisor tried to persuade him to drop the EEO claim by saying he was disappointed and could not believe he filed the claim, he and the Commander were perplexed by it, the supervisor nearly cried and claimed he could be fired, and advised if the claim continued it would jeopardize complainant's chance of getting the GS-14 promotion, but if it was dropped he would help assure complainant's promotion via competition. Complainant's father was recently diagnosed with a terminal medical condition. Complainant stated that he raised his feelings about it with the supervisor who advised him to spend the short remaining time with his father and that an EEO complaint would be troublesome to pursue. The supervisor acknowledged discussing the EEO complaint in this conversation. When asked about the conversation, the supervisor testified that he was surprised complainant filed an EEO claim, and he believed he discussed this with complainant, as well as his fear that it would spur at least co-worker 1 to file an EEO complaint and deepen internal office fights which would be very difficult to stomach. Testifying that he did not recall the exact language he used, the supervisor said that he did not know if he told complainant he and the Commander were perplexed and disappointed he filed the EEO claim, but he may have. IR, Vol I, pages 124-126.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next day, May 9, 2002, complainant withdrew his EEO contact, citing his emotional state with his father's diagnosis, the opportunity to compete for the GS-14 position, and the potential adverse impact it would have on his supervisors and the well being of the office. Complainant reinitiated contact with the EEO counselor regarding his complaint, as amended, on May 29, 2002.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the AJ erred when she concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding claim 6 (this analysis does not include the <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation finding). In finding no, genuine issue of material fact with interference in EEO process, the AJ's decision found that despite the supervisor's attempts complainant did not discuss his EEO allegations with him and there was no chilling effect on the process. In finding no chilling effect, the decision recited complainant's reasons in his withdrawal letter and that he reinitiated EEO contact on May 29, 2002. But there are genuine issues of material fact here because complainant's version of events indicates he was heavily pressured by his supervisor to withdraw his EEO claim, the supervisor's testimony corroborated some of the facts in complainant's version of events, and complainant's reasons for the alleged pressured withdrawal are consistent with some of the language in his withdrawal letter. While complainant reinitiated EEO contact on May 29, 2002, this delay raised questions of timeliness, delaying at length the processing <span id="Page_65"></span>of the promotion claim. We remind the parties, however, that while the burden of showing a claim is untimely is on the agency, the burden of showing discrimination is on complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found counselor contact timely in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120111526 (2011), where there was conflicting evidence on the advice given by the EEO counselor. Because the burden of proving untimely contact is squarely on the agency, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, defined that burden and explained why the agency failed to meet it:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulations provide that the agency or the Commission shall extend the time limits when the individual shows that she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that she did not know and reasonably should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from contacting the Counselor within the time limits, or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency or the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that Complainant met with ES on September 22, 2010, just five days after the alleged sexual assault by S. ES has submitted an unsworn and undated statement wherein she maintains that Complainant "was unsure as to whether or not she wanted to pursue a discrimination complaint stating she was interested in pursuing criminal actions" against S. ES further stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I advised [Complainant] that she had 45 calendar days from the date of the incident (17SEP10) to return to the EEO office to pursue a discrimination complaint. I counted the days on the calendar in my office. [Complainant] wrote the date on one of the papers she had with her and left my office. (Parentheses in oriGINAl)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ES's claims are directly contradicted by Complainant, who submitted a sworn affidavit dated November 10, 2010 and who avers that after she told ES that she had reported the September incident to the Agency's Criminal Investigation Command, ES told her "I do not think we can take your case because it is in criminal hands." Complainant further avers that ES "told me there was no basis for an EEO complaint." Based on these statements, Complainant avers "I did not file an EEO Complaint" at the time. Complainant next avers that ES told her that "if I later decided to file an EEO complaint.... I had 45 days after meeting with her to do so."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We thus have two statements that contradict each other. We note that where, as here, there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]n agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">Guy v. Dep't of Energy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930703 (Jan. 4, 1994) <span class="Italic">(quoting Williams v. Dep't of Def.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920506 (Aug. 25, 1992)). In addition, in <span class="Italic">Ericson v. Dep't of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920623 (Jan. 14, 1993), the Commission stated that "the agency has the burden of providing evidence and/or proof to support its final decisions." <span class="Italic">See also Gens v. Dep't of Def.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910837 (Jan. 31, 1992). In the instant case we note that ES's statement is not a sworn statement, while Complainant's statement is, which lends Complainant's statement more credibility. We further note that it is clear from the record that Complainant did not intend to abandon her EEO complaint. Instead the record shows that Complainant promptly reported the September 17 assault to management officials and then went to court and obtained a court order against S. Complainant then contacted an EEO Counselor the next day, well within the forty five day period, and within six weeks she obtained the services of an attorney and shortly thereafter she filed a Formal Complaint. All of these actions fall within the normal time frames for properly initiating an Informal and then Formal EEO complaint. We therefore find that the Agency has not met its burden of establishing that Complainant's EEO Counselor contact was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01981738 (1999), the Commission extended the 45-day limitation period because it found evidence that the delay was caused deliberately or inadvertently by the EEO Office:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to appellant, the EEO Office instructed him that before he could file a complaint, he had to wait for feedback from the Personnel Office about his nonselection, and he had to have a meeting with either the Information Systems Division Chief or the Service Center Director. This argument is more credible given that the same argument is also presented by four other individuals in appellant's office. These individuals currently have appeals pending decision before the Commission with regard to nonselections under the same vacancy announcement. We find further support for this position in the affidavit submitted by an agency employee who states that he has been a complainant and an employee representative. This individual described tactics engaged in by some EEO Counselors that coincide with those referenced by appellant. Such actions include requiring complainants to meet with managerial officials before allowing them to proceed with the EEO process, and after these meetings are concluded, scheduling meetings with complainants that reflect the current date as the initial contact date. The supplemental investigation undertaken by the agency does not appear to have focused on these issues. We are not satisfied that the agency has adequately refuted the concerns raised by appellant with regard to his contacts with the EEO Office prior to May 4, 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission found that the complainant made timely contact and set forth her intention to pursue her allegations of discrimination in <span class="Italic">Porter v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01976234 (1999). The agency in <span class="Italic">Porter</span> could not escape potential liability by relying on the complainant's delay in pursuing her complaint, which was due to reliance on what she was told by the EEO counselor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant intended to pursue the non-selection issue in January 1995. However, she did not do so until September 1995, approximately six months later, because she relied on the EEO Counselor's representation in January 1995, that she could pursue the allegation in the future. The Commission has held that agency actions that mislead an individual concerning his or her EEO rights will toll the limitations period<span class="Italic">. See Herrera v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05891351 (September 28, 1989) (the Commission found that it would allow the "tolling of time requirements when an agency lulls a complainant into taking no action or actively misleads or prevents a complainant from asserting his rights"); <span class="Italic">Ong v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880290 (August 8, 1988). Although the agency denies that appellant was misled by the EEO Counselor, we find appellant's affidavit more persuasive than the declaration of the EEO Counselor which is tenuous and appears to be purposefully vague. Furthermore, in her declaration, the EEO Counselor did not deny that she informed appellant that she could pursue the allegation later. The EEO Counselor stated only that she could not recall if she had done so. The Commission has held that, where, as here, there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]n agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">Guy v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930703 (January 4, 1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920506 (August 25, 1992)). The agency has failed to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Parker v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A03425 (2001) (the complainant relied on advice from an unspecified EEO counselor).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Whitley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01913883 (1991), the Commission held that a complainant establishes good cause for waiving the time requirement for initiating precomplaint counseling when she demonstrates that the agency EEO counselor advised her to delay filing a complaint and gave her further assurances that she would have the right to bring the claim at a later date. Whitley sought to challenge the fact that she was placed on an emergency suspension pending removal. The complainant was advised that her case would be closed without prejudice pending resolution of the underlying criminal charges against her. Although the Commission noted that the agency was in error in believing the complainant could wait until after the criminal proceedings to file her complaint, it further found that "it is only equitable to accept the claim and not penalize the appellant for relying on the improper advice obtained from the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01921378 (1992) (the EEO office advised the complainant to await the outcome of a grievance proceeding prior to deciding whether or not to file an EEO complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Adams v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120110900 (2011), the Commission found that the complainant's otherwise untimely contact with the counselor should be deemed timely where the complainant was told by an EEO counselor that she had 45 days after speaking with the selecting official to get more information regarding her nonselection to initiate counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A21368 (2002), the Commission found that the complainant's withdrawal from counseling was not valid where it was premised on the representations of the counselor that he could reinitiate counseling after he received a response from management on his request for a pay increase and position upgrade. Because his initial contact was timely, the agency erred in dismissing his complaint. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Compton v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a50809.txt">01A50809</a> (2005), the Commission applied equitable estoppel where the complainant relied on the advice on an EEO counselor that a later written clarification of her complaint would not affect the timeliness of the initial complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Compton</span> found that equitable estoppel is "'the principle by which a party is precluded by his own acts, words, or silence from asserting a right to which he otherwise would be entitled against another who rightfully relied on the party's acts, words, or silence to his detriment.'"</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency lulls a complainant into not filing a timely complaint when it tells the complainant that a management official is reviewing the situation to see if it can be resolved outside of the EEO process and also assures her this will not affect the timeliness of any subsequent complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Short v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01971555 (1998), the EEO counselor told the complainant to wait until after completion of the inspector general investigation to initiate counseling<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Thrower v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01932022 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120140384 (2014), the Commission set aside the 45-day contact period finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not show that the Agency advised Complainant of the appropriate procedures and timeframes for initiating an EEO complaint. He was not told to contact an EEO Counselor. On the contrary, Complainant alleges that management officials laughed at him after <span id="Page_66"></span>he followed through on their advice to contact the Office of Special Counsel and missed the 45-day filing period. We recognize that because Complainant filed an earlier EEO complaint, he should have been aware of the 45-day filing requirement. In this case, however, Complainant believed that he was taking appropriate action by making the contacts that he made and raising the EEO claims that he raised up the chain of command. There is no evidence that he was cautioned that he would lose his right to proceed with an EEOC claim if he did not first contact an EEO counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the record includes a "Local Complaint Form" (dated March 19, 2013) in which Complainant clearly alleged that he being harassed and subjected to an erroneous charge that he wanted removed from his work record. On appeal, Complainant has presented persuasive arguments regarding his many attempts to timely bring his EEO concerns to the attention of the appropriate officials. He also states that "since EEO was as hostile as supervision," he was advised to appeal to his chain of command for assistance. There is no evidence that management ever advised Complainant that he should contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the effective date of any challenged action. Rather, as Complainant described it, management sent him on a "wild goose chase," that caused him to miss the traditional EEO deadlines. Given these circumstances, we exercise our discretion, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) in finding that equitable tolling is appropriate with regard to Complainant's hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency leads a complainant to believe that he must exhaust informal avenues for resolving a complaint of discrimination, the time frame for contacting a counselor will be tolled. In <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956079 (1996), although there was no evidence that the agency deliberately misled the complainant, the Commission found that the complainant would be rightfully confused by the agency's responses to his letters to agency officials seeking religious accommodation, particularly because the complainant was an applicant for employment. In tolling the time frame for contacting a counselor in <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the appellant submits copies of several letters pertaining to his request for accommodation. In an August 18, 1994 letter to the Personnel Department, the appellant informed the agency that Employee B in the Personnel Department told him that if he did not agree with the agency's accommodation policy, he was free to "go to the EEOC and file a complaint...." By letter of August 31, 1994, the Manager of Administration wrote to the appellant. He informed the appellant that his August 4, 1994 letter to the Postmaster General was receiving full consideration. He also requested that the appellant "remember that an important step in the review process will be to ensure that all regular channels to a solution have been attempted." By letter of October 13, 1994, an Employee and Placement Specialist informed the appellant of the agency's substantive response to his letter to the Postmaster General. Therein, the Employee and Placement Specialist informed the appellant that the agency has a policy of attempting to make reasonable efforts to accommodate religious beliefs. The Specialist cautioned, however, that such accommodations could result in substantial inconvenience to the appellant because of the business requirements of the agency and, in some instances, termination could result if a reasonable accommodation could not be made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency did not submit a statement in response to the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) requires an aggrieved person to initiate contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2) requires the agency or the Commission to extend the 45-day time limit when the individual shows that he or she (1) was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them; (2) did not know and reasonably should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred; and (3) despite due diligence was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting the counselor within the time limits. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2) also permits the agency or the Commission to extend the 45-day time limit for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency or the Commission. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) further provides that the time limits in Part 1614 are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant knew at the time of his August 4, 1994 letter to the Postmaster General that the agency could not guarantee he would have every Saturday off as an accommodation for his religious beliefs. He did not seek EEO counseling until November 14, 1994. Ordinarily, the initiation of an internal appeal process would not toll the time limit for seeking EEO counseling<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Linda E. Mov v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940107 (November 30, 1994) (denial of the appellant's suggestion by higher level officials following a previous denial of the appellant's suggestion by lower-level officials). However, in the instant case, the agency specifically informed the appellant by letter of August 31, 1994, that an important step in the review process would be to ensure that all regular channels to a solution have been attempted. Thereby, the agency led the appellant to believe that he had to exhaust all "regular channels" prior to seeking another avenue of relief. Accordingly, in the appellant's request for counseling, he informed the agency that he had gone through all of the chain of command, all the way to the Postmaster General.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the appellant's confusion as to his EEO rights was evident from his August 18, 1994 letter to the Personnel Department. Therein, the appellant informed the agency that Employee B in the Personnel Department told him that if he did not agree with the agency's accommodation policy, he was free to "go to the EEOC and file a complaint...." There is no indication in the record that the Personnel Department corrected the appellant's misinformation by notifying him that he should contact an EEO counselor, not EEOC, within 45 calendar days if he wanted to initiate an EEO complaint regarding the alleged failure to accommodate his religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency knew that the appellant was an applicant for employment and, therefore, may not have had knowledge of the federal EEO process. Yet there is no evidence in the record that the agency notified the appellant of the time limitations for EEO counselor contact after he informed the agency that he thought he had been wrongly denied a requested accommodation for his religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above-stated reasons, the Commission finds that the time limitation period for the appellant's EEO counselor contact should be tolled until the date that the appellant received the agency's October 13, 1994 letter<span class="Italic">. See Paul Robertson, Jr. v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910949 (February 28, 1992) (time period for EEO Counselor contact tolled where no evidence that the appellant had been informed of his EEO rights and the appellant could have been misled to believe that supervisors could not use the EEO process). The appellant sought EEO counseling on November 14, 1994, within the 45-calendar-day period for EEO counselor contact. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the appellant's EEO counselor contact was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, on its own motion, found that the agency incorrectly dismissed the complaint in <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05980835 (2000), as untimely. The Commission explained that the agency in <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span> could not use the following argument, having misled the complainant as to filing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that in his request for reconsideration, complainant more fully set forth his argument that the agency EEO office had misled him, an argument which he had not completely developed in his previous appeal. We note that the agency did not rebut his argument beyond their oriGINAl findings in the FAD that he had reasonable suspicion at points in time significantly earlier than his EEO contact. A careful examination of the record reveals that the documents the agency cites to for proof that complainant had knowledge that he was being discriminated against do not show that complainant also knew that he had the ability to file EEO complaints on these two issues. In fact, given the complainant's contention that he had been told by the EEO Counselor that he did not have the ability to file complaints on these issues, reasonable suspicion of discrimination would not have triggered complainant to contact an EEO Counselor if he were under the understanding that it would do him no good. The possibly conflicting advice of his own representative (who the record reveals is not an attorney) would not necessarily have changed his actions if the EEO office was refusing to let him file. We reverse the previous decision and the FAD and find that the complainant was timely in his EEO contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, specifically advising a potential complainant to delay counselor contact because the agency is addressing the allegations of discrimination is sufficient to set aside the 45-day time period. In <span class="Italic">Battey v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01993312 (1999), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the alleged discriminatory actions from January 1998 thru October 1998 were acts that prompted appellant to have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination at the time that they occurred. We note, for example, that on appeal, appellant offers into evidence several written communications with management informing them of the discriminatory actions being taken against him. Clearly, appellant had a suspicion of discrimination. However, within an email from appellant's supervisor, Mark Barron, he states "...I am encouraging you not to talk to Shari and just be patient." It should be noted, that Shari, is an EEO Counselor. And in a subsequent email to appellant, supervisor Allen Hoberman, states "...we will commit to treating your issues fairly and in a responsible manner." This email was sent in response to appellant seeking to address the issues of discrimination in the appropriate forum. In addition, appellant alleges, and the agency fails to rebut, that on July 30, 1998 appellant contacted Mr. Mitchell to determine the status of the investigation but, was told "he could expect the results of the investigation in a couple of weeks and to hang in their" [sic]. It is clear, that management, within their communications, lulled appellant into <span id="Page_67"></span>believing that he did not have to initiate action, that he should not contact an EEO Counselor and that they (management) would fairly and in a responsible manner resolve the issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, appellant has presented adequate evidence that he was misled and discouraged by the agency in pursuing his EEO rights. Thus, providing adequate justification pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2), for extending the limitation period beyond forty-five days....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bonsuk v. Attorney General</span>, 01A22271 (2002) (complainant was told he should "hold off" on his EEO complaint because management wanted to resolve the situation internally); <span class="Italic">Dittrich v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01991337 (1999) (agency could not assert untimely contact where it encouraged complainant to "hold off" and meet with an "EEO mediator" instead of pursuing counseling).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Preston B. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120141133 (2015), the Commission estopped the agency from asserting untimely counselor contact where management told the complainant it was considering his request to be paid a higher rate for a detail assignment after he discovered that his replacement was getting the higher rate. The complainant did not contact a counselor until the agency informed him it would not pay the higher rate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, where the complainant is reasonably confused about whether her report of sexual harassment to her supervisor was sufficient to initiate the EEO process because of the supervisor's actions, the time limit for counselor contact can be set aside. In <span class="Italic">Sookdeo v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120083009 (2008), the complainant's supervisor told her he would contact the EEO office to determine what steps needed to be taken next. Shortly thereafter, the agency began an internal investigation into the complainant's allegations. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Sookdeo</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The time limit to initiate contact with an EEO counselor can be extended for reasons considered sufficient by the agency or Commission. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2). Complainant argues that she believed the EEO process commenced upon her contact with her supervisor. In opposition to complainant's appeal, the agency argues that the supervisor's actions should not extend the time limit to initiate EEO counseling because he contacted an EEO counselor to learn of his responsibilities, and never told her she was covered by his contact. The agency argues that nothing about the Commander's Inquiry should have confused complainant into believing it was an EEO investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Dowdy v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120083106 (September 19, 2008), concerned a sexual harassment complaint by a co-worker of complainant who had the same supervisor and involved the same alleged perpetrator. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal for untimely EEO contact. In strikingly similar facts, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Dowdy</span> contended that when she informed the supervisor of the alleged sexual harassment, he stated he would contact the EEO office to see how to proceed. In light of this, it ruled that the complainant exhibited her intent to begin the EEO process when she contacted her superior about her concerns on January 11, 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like in <span class="Italic">Dowdy</span>, we find sufficient reason to extend the time limit to initiate EEO counseling. Complainant wrote that the supervisor said he would call EEO office to see what proper steps needed to be taken to start the process, and there is no statement in the record by the supervisor denying this. The Commander's Inquiry followed shortly thereafter, likely creating more confusion in complainant's mind. We find that the agency unintentionally misled complainant to believe the EEO process had been initiated on January 11, 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hortencia R. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120161496 (2016) (evidence that the agency failed to include a complaint form and issued multiple confusing notices was adequate justification for extending the time limits). A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Rather v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120080750 (2009), where the complainant, who worked in the EEO office, reported allegations of sexual harassment to a coworker who was an EEO counselor and her second-line supervisor who was Chief of EEO. The second-line supervisor advised the complainant to report her allegations to the Office of Security. Because the second-line supervisor had specifically assured that complainant that pursuing the matter with the Office of Security was the proper course and never advised her of the right to also pursue the matter through the EEO process, the Commission determined that it was appropriate to waive the time limit for initiating counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, an informal discussion with a former EEO counselor was not sufficient to constitute timely contact. In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120092282 (2009), the Commission relied upon a statement by the former counselor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The conversation to which I am referring above, took place in a hallway, not in an office setting. I recall Ms, Cook telling me that she thought her transfer might be some kind of vendetta against her; but I cannot remember why she thought this might be the case, or any names that she may have mentioned. Ms Cook was speaking to me as a friend, not in the capacity of an EEO counselor although at one time, I had been an EEO Counselor. I remember suggesting to her that she should find out if others were also transferred. I did not advise Ms Cook with regard to any time limits or durations involved in the EEO process, I merely told her that I thought she should soon contact the Intake Unit (EEO). As stated above, our conversation was informal; I know that many things may have changed in the EEO process, and there may have been many things about which I was not trained. I would not have given Ms Cook any specific advice or counsel about how to proceed.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency mistakenly advised an employee that he or she had MSPB appeal rights and the employee subsequently files a timely Board appeal, the agency will not be permitted to later dismiss the case for untimely counselor contact after the Board dismisses the case for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10396 (2002) (agency mistakenly advised the complainant he was a preference eligible veteran).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the agency's advice does not specifically preclude contact with an EEO counselor, it will be held to bar a timeliness defense where the complainant reasonably interpreted the advice as precluding such contact. In <span class="Italic">Hood v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01982504 (1999), the complainant, as part of an agency investigation into pornography in the workplace, was asked by the investigator not to discuss the matter with anyone. The employee contended that he interpreted the request to preclude discussing the matter with an EEO counselor. Despite the investigator's contention that his request was limited to discussing the investigation with other agency employees, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Hood</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...[W]e find that the agency in this case cannot raise the untimeliness issue to dismiss appellant's complaint. As an explanation for why he may have been untimely, appellant told the EEO Counselor that the agency official in charge of the investigation into the presence of the pornography had instructed him not to discuss the matter with anyone. Appellant took this to mean that he was under a "gag order." The agency, on appeal, argued that appellant's explanation was not sufficient to waive the time limitation. It submitted an affidavit from the investigator that said he had asked appellant not to discuss the matter with other employees at the facility, but that he had not instructed appellant not to file an EEO complaint. Appellant, however, claims that his understanding was that he had to wait until the completion of the investigation before he could contact an EEO Counselor. He contacted an EEO Counselor once he had learned the investigation had been completed. The Commission has previously held that an agency may not dismiss a complaint based on an appellant's untimeliness, if that untimeliness is caused by the agency's action in misleading or misinforming the appellant<span class="Italic">. See Wilkinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950205 (March 25, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Application of the estoppel doctrine does not require deliberate misconduct on the part of the agency. However, most of the Commission's case law does impose a requirement that the agency take some affirmative action in order for the doctrine to apply, though a few cases have focused on the agency's failure to act. See discussion in section below on "<span class="blue">Reliance on Agency Inaction</span>." In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Education</span>, 05920654 (1993), the Commission found the agency was under no obligation to provide written notice of EEO complaint rights with a letter of suspension, but it was bound by erroneous advice even if given gratuitously. An example is provided by <span class="Italic">Upshaw v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120081265 (2008), where the complainant, who was on a two-year probationary period, was advised in her termination letter that she had no grievance or appeal rights. Although the Commission found that the complainant had presented good cause for her untimely counselor contact on the termination, it found a claim involving a letter of reprimand to be untimely where the letter had advised the complainant of the 45-day limit for initiating counselor contact if she believed the reprimand to be discriminatory. The Commission did note, however, that evidence on the reprimand was relevant to the termination claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Attorney General</span>, 01970293 (2001), the Commission applied the doctrine of estoppel to several complaints of reprisal where, after the initial complaint, the complainant was placed on "home duty" and prohibited from leaving his home during work hours without the permission of his supervisor and there were long delays in responding to the employee's written complaints of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a communication from an agency official can be fairly read as incorrectly informing an employee that she could not file an EEO complaint, the agency will be estopped from asserting that the oriGINAl contact with that official should not be regarded as the contact date for counseling purposes. <span class="Italic">Blut v. General Services Administration</span>, 01945749 (1996). Unfortunately, for the complainant in <span class="Italic">Blut</span>, however, even using the earlier contact date did not make his complaint timely. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bolden v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 012009344 (2010) (EEO director and HR chief told complainant to contact Office of Special Counsel); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01965608 (1997) (complainant contacted an EEO counselor and the counselor erroneously told the complainant she was an employee of the contractor and not the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission applied the estoppel doctrine in <span class="Italic">Herrera v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890705 (1989), where the complainant alleged that a postal inspector assured him that a letter of reprimand would be withdrawn. Herrera further alleged that, based on these assurances, he delayed contacting a counselor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such reliance on appellant's part falls within the ambit of 29 CFR <span id="Page_68"></span>1613.214(a)(4) and is sufficient reason to extend the prescribed time period for contacting an EEO Counselor, especially since a potential for abuse exists if agency officials make such assurance and then do nothing, in order to cause a complainant to be untimely in presenting complaints. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Seedman v. Alexander's, Inc.</span>, 683 F. Supp. 924 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (agency is estopped from applying time limit if it "lulled the [complainant] into believing that it was not necessary for him to commence [action]").</p>
<p class="noindent">The case was remanded with instructions to investigate complainant's contention regarding the postal inspector's assurances and, if such assurances were received, to determine if the complainant timely contacted a counselor after discovering the assurances were false.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that EEO procedures have been made clear to all employees is not a defense to a claim that the agency has affirmatively misled a complainant into failing to act. <span class="Italic">Whipple v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05910586 (1991). That the complainant was generally aware of EEO procedures and time limits does not prevent her from claiming that she was affirmatively misled by a civilian personnel officer who allegedly stated that because she filed a complaint with the agency inspector general, she could not also pursue the matter through an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">While not relying on the doctrine of estoppel, a similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Ulmer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A55760 (2006). In that case, the complainant received a letter of warning. On the 44th day after receiving the warning, the complainant attended an agency "stand--up talk" where new procedures for counselor contact were outlined. The next day, the complainant attempted to contact a counselor after business hours using the new procedure, which was not yet in effect. The Commission found that the complainant had, in good faith, attempted to follow the new procedures and had established sufficient reason for setting aside the time frame.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it is not entirely clear from the Commission's decisions, it appears that, in addition to establishing some affirmative action on the part of the agency, the employee must also establish that the action resulted in some harm. In <span class="Italic">Bornemann v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01892576 (1989), the Commission found that the agency waived any objection to the untimely contact of an EEO counselor where it affirmatively misled the appellant into an "extended delay [that] has adversely affected appellant in a substantial manner...." The agency was deemed not to have waived its right to dismiss the complaint as untimely on the basis that it had accepted the complaint for investigation. However, subsequent to the investigation, the agency issued a proposed disposition with a finding of no discrimination. The complainant requested a hearing. She later withdrew her request for a hearing after the agency promised to issue a final decision on the record within 90 days. Approximately two years and nine months later, the agency dismissed the complaint on the basis of timeliness. The Commission vacated and remanded the agency's decision with instructions to issue a final decision within 30 days. Interestingly, the Commission made no comment on whether the complainant could now request a hearing. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Sty v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984065 (1999), the agency failed to process the complaint at any level. The complainant was denied counseling and filed a formal complaint after 30 days. The agency ignored the formal complaint and the complainant requested a hearing after 180 days. The agency also ignored an order from the administrative judge to provide the complainant with a counselor and investigator outside of her district due to the nature of the allegations and the past conduct of the EEO office. The case was remanded by the Commission for the agency to investigate the timeliness of counselor contact and labeling the agency's conduct "completely unacceptable." Although not specifically discussed in the <span class="Italic">Sty</span> decision, it would appear that estoppel was not considered by the Commission because there was no contention that the agency's misconduct had affected the timely contact of a counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission also has held that even though an agency's misconduct in the counseling stage of complaint processing does not cause the complainant's late filing of his formal complaint, it may provide grounds for waiving the time limitation for filing complaints. <span class="Italic">Teller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921780 (1992). In a decision that avoids any harmful error analysis, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Teller</span>, reversed an agency decision to dismiss a complaint as untimely on the basis that the agency had denied the complainant representation during the counseling phase:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant concedes that his complaint was untimely filed. However, appellant contends that the EEO counselor's misrepresentations to appellant during the final interview caused him to sign the final interview form without realizing the consequences of his signature. Appellant also asserts that the agency should have rescheduled the final interview at a time when appellant's representative could be present. Moreover, appellant states that the EEO counselor made no effort to resolve his complaint at the informal counseling stage and never notified appellant's representative of the final interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find that the circumstances surrounding appellant's final interview with the EEO counselor directly caused appellant's untimely filing of his complaint. Following the final interview, appellant states that he consulted his representative, who informed appellant that his formal complaint had to be filed within fifteen days of the notice of final interview. Once appellant learned of the fifteen-day time limit, he was responsible for the timely filing of his complaint, absent another reason which would justify extending the time limits. Rush-hour traffic on the deadline day for filing the complaint does not constitute a circumstance beyond appellant's control which would ordinarily warrant a Commission waiver of 1613.214(a)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, however, appellant has alleged that the agency denied him the right to representation at the counseling stage of the EEO process, misrepresented certain facts to him during EEO counseling, and made no effort to resolve his complaint at the informal stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The informal stage of the EEO process is extremely important, both because it provides an opportunity for resolution or settlement and because it can provide the agency with information during the formal stage of an EEO complaint. EEO regulations provide that an employee shall have the right to be accompanied, represented and advised by a representative of his choice at any stage, including the counseling stage, of an EEO complaint. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.214(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, not only was appellant denied the right to representation during EEO counseling, but it does not appear that appellant's representative was included in any part of the informal stage of appellant's complaint. (footnote omitted) The EEO counselor could have scheduled a second counseling interview in order for appellant's representative to play some role in the process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, even though we do not find that the agency's misconduct was directly responsible for appellant's untimely filing of his EEO formal complaint, we do find that appellant's complaint was not handled properly at the informal stage. Therefore, under these particular circumstances, we find that sufficient reasons exist for waiving the time limits of 1613.214(a)(1)(ii) and remanding appellant's complaint for further EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision is important because it places no requirement on the complainant to show that the agency's misconduct in the counseling stage caused the untimely filing. The Commission probably will not discard the harmful error analysis but will require some causal connection, where the alleged agency misconduct is not severe.</p>
<p class="noindent">The actions taken by the agency do not necessarily have to relate to the EEO complaint process in order for estoppel to apply. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940797 (1996), the Commission applied the doctrine of estoppel where the employee complained of sexual harassment to her supervisor on several occasions. On each occasion, the harassment would then cease for a period of time. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record herein, the Commission finds that the time limits should be equitably tolled and the agency should be barred, under the principle of equitable estoppel, from rejecting appellant's sexual harassment and reprisal allegations on timeliness grounds. "Equitable estoppel is the principle by which a party is precluded by his own acts, words, or silence from asserting a right to which he otherwise would be entitled against another who rightfully relied on the party's acts, words, or silence to his detriment." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931557 (February 17, 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co.</span>, 960 F.2d 1020, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). The facts indicate that appellant first raised allegations of sexual harassment against the alleged harasser some time after 1986, when she spoke to S1, who told her that he would take care of the situation. The record indicates that, at least for a time, the incidents ceased, but that they would begin again. This pattern apparently repeated several times: appellant would complain of harassment and the agency would address the matter. In 1990, after S1 moved appellant and the alleged harasser to a new facility and promoted the alleged harasser into a position from which he supervised appellant, improper conduct began again, escalated, and included acts of reprisal. We find that appellant relied on S1's statement that he would deal with the alleged harasser's conduct and that her reliance was reasonable because the alleged harasser's conduct abated for a time after she complained. Appellant timely sought EEO counseling after the agency relocated her to the same facility as the alleged harasser and he resumed his improper conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission has tolled the time limit for an employee when the agency affirmatively misleads her on the right to compete for a selection. <span class="Italic">Swoopes v. Department of Army</span>, 01840108 (1985). The agency must take affirmative steps to mislead the employee. The employee's own misunderstanding of his or her rights, standing alone, is not sufficient reason to toll the time limitation.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible for an agency to be estopped from asserting that the formal complaint was untimely and yet still assert that counselor contact was not timely. In <span class="Italic">Abernathy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01962216 (1997), the Commission rejected the agency's defense that the formal complaint was untimely, but left open the door for the agency to assert untimely counselor contact. The defense was left open even though the agency already had received a recommended decision with a finding of discrimination. The Commission, at great length, explained its holding in <span class="Italic">Abernathy</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_69"></span>The question before the Commission is whether the agency has waived or is estopped from asserting its right to dismiss the complaint for untimely EEO Counselor contact or for failure to timely file the complaint. The Commission has stated the general rule for such an issue is as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(I)f an agency accepts a complaint containing a stale, untimely filed charge of discrimination and considers it during its processing and investigation of other timely allegations in the same complaint, then that agency...will not be deemed to have automatically waived the requirement that (an Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor be contacted) within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Tanski v. Defense Investigative Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05840036 (Apr. 18, 1985) (parentheses and ellipsis oriGINAl); <span class="Italic">accord Kerans v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942838 (June 28, 1994) (citation omitted), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940752 (Mar. 16, 1995). The Commission has held that "such an automatic waiver does not occur unless the agency has also found that discrimination exists on the merits of the claim." <span class="Italic">Tanski</span>, EEOC Request No. 05840036 (citing <span class="Italic">Oaxaca</span>, 641 F.2d 386 (other citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Tanski</span> the Commission found that EEOC Regulations provide "agencies with discretion to extend, or waive, time limits for reasons considered sufficient."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Tanski</span> the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When reasons sufficient to require extension or waiver are apparent and the agency decides instead to invoke its authority to reject an untimely claim [for untimely counselor contact or for failure to timely file a complaint], the agency may be said to have abused its discretion. [citation omitted].</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is under circumstances in which an abuse of discretion may occur through the invocation of [the regulation for rejecting complaints for untimely counselor contact or for failure to timely file a complaint] that agencies may be held to be estopped from asserting their authority to reject untimely claims. [citation omitted]. The fact that a Complaints Examiner [now known as administrative judges] rather than the agency found discrimination to be present does not present a distinction sufficient to find the estoppel theory to be inapplicable. The conditions for estoppel exist in this case as they exist in cases in which the agency itself finds discrimination. The agency accepted the allegation; investigated the allegation; issued a proposed disposition on the allegation; and participated fully in the hearing which focused almost exclusively on the nonselection allegation. Thus, there is no prejudice or surprise to the agency in denying its right to reject the untimely claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency, faced with the knowledge that record evidence gathered in proceedings to which it was a party, is sufficient to lead to a reasonable conclusion that discrimination may have occurred, had sufficient reason to expressly waive the time requirements. Although the agency did not waive the time requirements, it is estopped from asserting them, where, as in this case, to do so would constitute an abuse of the discretion conferred upon agencies by [the regulation allowing the agency to extend, or waive, time limits for reasons considered sufficient].</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Tanski</span> that it did not want to "permit agencies that have not asserted authority to reject the claim to avoid liability and ignore evidence of discrimination through the expediency of rejecting untimely claims."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Tanski</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The policies expressed above [of eradicating discrimination and encouraging voluntary efforts by the agency to uncover and remedy discrimination] are better served by a rule that estops agencies from asserting theretofore unasserted authority to reject untimely claims when faced with their own findings or a Complaints Examiner's [now an administrative judge's] recommended findings of discrimination, after the agency has fully participated in the evidentiary proceedings of investigation and/or hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held in various instances that it was not improper for an agency to wait until the hearing stage, or after the hearing in one case, to reject or dismiss a complaint for procedural reasons<span class="Italic">. Rodriguez v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953421 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Cook v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944962 (Oct. 12, 1995) (agency's procedural dismissal of the complaint issued after issuance of administrative judge's findings and conclusions, but before agency's receipt of the administrative judge's findings and conclusions); <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01944212 (Nov. 16, 1994); <span class="Italic">Kerans</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942838, <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940752; <span class="Italic">Magdaleno v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912108 (July 24, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Failure to Timely File a Complaint</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the agency did not contend in its October 21, 1994 motion, in arguments with the administrative judge, or at any other time prior to receipt of the administrative judge's findings of intentional discrimination, that appellant failed to timely file his complaint, the agency is estopped from dismissing the complaint for failure to timely file a complaint<span class="Italic">. Tanski</span>, EEOC Request No. 05840036. Although the agency referred in the October 21, 1994 motion to untimely complaints and some of the arguments before the administrative judge also referred to untimely complaints, we find that such references were really inadvertent references to untimely EEO counselor contact. For instance, the October 21, 1994 motion refers to the date of the incident of discrimination and the date appellant contacted an EEO Counselor. There is no reference in the October 21, 1994 motion to the triggering date for the commencement of the 15 day time period for filing a complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.106(b) ("A complaint must be filed within 15 days of receipt of the notice required by &#x00A7; 1614.105(d), (e), or (f)."). Furthermore, the arguments at the hearing on the October 21, 1994 motion clearly concern how late the appellants purportedly contacted an EEO Counselor. There is no mention in those arguments by any of the parties, including the administrative judge, of when appellants received the notice required by &#x00A7; 1614.105(d), (e), or (f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concludes that the agency waited until a finding of discrimination was made by the administrative judge before the agency first attempted to assert its right to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that appellant failed to timely file his complaint. This is precisely the type of dismissal forbidden by <span class="Italic">Tanski. Tanski</span>, EEOC Request No. 05840036. Therefore, we shall reverse the agency's use of the grounds of untimely filed complaint as a reason for rejecting the administrative judge's findings and conclusions. The agency is estopped from asserting that appellant failed to timely file his complaint<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Failure to Timely Contact an EEO Counselor</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserted in its October 21, 1994 motion, and in arguments on that motion with the administrative judge, that it appeared that appellant failed to timely contact an EEO Counselor. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Tanski</span>, the instant agency did not wait until after a finding of discrimination was made before attempting to assert its authority to dismiss the complaint for appellant's purported failure to timely contact an EEO Counselor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In the instant matter the agency is not estopped from asserting that appellant failed to timely contact an EEO Counselor, because the agency clearly asserted prior to the hearing and prior to any finding of discrimination its desire to make a determination concerning the timeliness of appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor. The agency also has made no determination that appellant timely contacted an EEO Counselor and therefore the agency has not waived its right to assert that appellant failed to timely contact an EEO Counselor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Therefore, we find that the agency may now assert that appellant failed to timely contact an EEO Counselor. The agency, however, did not find in the FAD that appellant failed to timely contact an EEO Counselor because, in part, the agency wanted to give appellant an opportunity to explain the apparent lateness of his initial contact with an EEO Counselor. The Commission makes no determination in this decision as to whether appellant timely contacted an EEO Counselor. The Commission shall remand the matter so that the agency can determine whether appellant timely contacted an EEO Counselor. In summary, the Commission finds that the agency may, on remand, dismiss the complaint for failure to timely contact an EEO Counselor, but may not dismiss the complaint for failure to timely file the complaint. Because the agency did not dismiss the complaint, the Commission does not consider in this decision whether appellant timely contacted an EEO Counselor. The Commission also does not consider in this decision the merits of the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The location of the employee also can have an effect on whether estoppel should apply. In <span class="Italic">Moser v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01953359 (1996), the Commission tolled the 45-day time frame for contacting a counselor where the complainant, who was stationed in Korea, alleged that he had previously contacted a counselor in Korea and was told he had no basis for filing a complaint. The Commission noted two significant facts: first, the second EEO counselor's report did state that the complainant contended he had previously contacted a counselor in Korea; second, the agency failed to submit any statement denying the earlier contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency will be deemed to have waived the time limitation for contacting a counselor when it prevents a potential complainant from contacting a counselor and pursuing her complaint of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Duplantier v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01921112 (1992). In that case, the complainant contacted an EEO official who conducted his own informal investigation of the complaint and then informed the complainant that she did not have a legally cognizable claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kelvin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960357 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant's harassment allegation was improperly dismissed on timeliness grounds where the agency's own advice led the complainant to believe that he could wait to seek EEO counseling until after a series of incidents of harassment had occurred. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kelvin</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission has recently held that even a single incident <span id="Page_70"></span>of alleged harassment states a cognizable claim of discrimination as to which an employee may, <span class="Italic">a fortiori</span>, seek EEO counseling, (<span class="Italic">see Osborne v. Rubin, Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960111 [July 19, 1996]), the fact remains that the agency correctly advised the appellant that he could await seeking EEO counseling until such time as a series of incidents had occurred that might suggest prohibited harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consequently, the Commission rejected the agency's contention that the complainant was obliged to seek EEO counseling within 45 days of each incident when the customer services manager allegedly made derogatory comments about his performance. Although each alleged derogatory remark could form the basis of a complaint of harassment, the Commission in Kelvin held there is nothing that prevents a complainant from waiting to see whether those individual incidents are part of an ongoing pattern of prohibited harassment before he or she initiates the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee raises an allegation of discrimination, she should be referred to an EEO counselor. An agency may not refer the complainant to an employee assistance program and then dismiss a subsequent complaint for failure to timely contact a counselor. <span class="Italic">Benson v. Attorney General</span>, 05931212 (1994). Likewise, where an appellant relies on erroneous advice from the agency on how to process a claim, the Commission may remand for proper processing. In <span class="Italic">Cauthern v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 01965372 (1997), the appellant requested reinstatement as a remedy in a complaint over a proposed removal. In its comments on appeal, the agency noted that the appellant had not filed a complaint regarding his dismissal. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cauthern</span> remanded the removal complaint because it found that the agency issued conflicting information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, the Commission finds that the agency erred in its processing of appellant's allegation. Although it properly identified appellant's allegation in his complaint as relating to a proposed personnel action, it provided appellant with conflicting procedures for pursuing a claim on the removal action itself. The Commission notes that the agency advised appellant in its final decision that if he sought to file a complaint on the action when it was implemented, he should file a complaint, without first seeking counseling. It advised appellant in the notice of removal issued three days later to appeal the removal to the MSPB or file another EEO complaint by first contacting a Counselor. Thus, while it properly determined that the allegation concerned a proposed personnel action, it failed to provide an appropriate procedure for appellant to pursue a claim concerning the actual removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that appellant's appeal also references his removal by the agency and includes the request that he be provided the appropriate remedies for that agency action. Since the agency provided conflicting instructions to appellant concerning how he should pursue a complaint on his removal, the Commission orders that it be processed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the time limit will be waived for a complainant who is told there is no informal process for raising an EEO complaint, the allegation itself does not state a claim for relief. In <span class="Italic">Cardenas v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01963194 (1997), the Commission upheld an agency decision dismissing a complaint that the employee's supervisor told him there was no informal EEO process. The decision itself is somewhat mystifying, as the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the allegation should be dismissed because the complainant eventually sought counseling on his complaint. At the same time, the Commission affirmed dismissal of the allegation for failure to state a claim. However, the Commission also noted that the agency investigated the allegations and that it was satisfied that "employees were not misinformed or discouraged from participating in the EEO process."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> It appears that the rejection was on the merits of the claim and not whether an employee states a cognizable claim by alleging he was misinformed about the process. The regulations now require dismissal of complaints about the processing of complaints. 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(8). It is worth noting that the issue of whether the time frame for initiating counseling should be waived because of an agency's actions and whether those actions can form the basis of a new complaint are distinct. A decision to waive the time limit has no effect on whether the agency's actions constitute a legally cognizable claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency can also be estopped from asserting a timeliness defense where its instructions to a complainant were simply so confusing that a reasonable person could have become confused. In <span class="Italic">Cueto v. Attorney General</span>, 01963999 (1997), the Commission waived the time period for counseling where it found the agency's communications with the complainant to be confusing as to her obligations. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cueto</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the time limitation period in this case should be waived pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.604(c). We find that the advice provided to appellant from May 1993 through March 1994, was confusing and contradictory; consequently, she may have been misled as to her obligations. We note, for example, that in the May 1993 letter appellant was told, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you feel that you are being reprised against for your participation in the EEO process, you may fill out an DOJ-201-A form. Please keep in mind that the basis and issues should be the same as filed in your previous complaint. If the basis and issues are not the same then you need to seek EEO counseling before submitting your formal complaint form to this office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the confusing second and third sentence, we find that it is reasonable that appellant, in accordance with the first sentence, may have felt that she need only submit the complaint form to the agency, since she believed that she was being retaliated against.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's second letter, dated July 12, 1993, is equally confusing. Appellant was informed that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On May 7, 1993, a letter was mailed to you from...addressing your concern about reprisal because you participated in the EEO process. Also enclosed with the letter was a DOJ-210-a form to be completed by you if you felt you had been reprised against.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, appellant was told that there was no need to seek EEO counseling if she was alleging reprisal as a basis. We note that appellant was also informed that if she was alleging discrimination based on race, which she was, she had to seek EEO counseling. We find that the confusion that had already been created might have caused appellant to misunderstand what was required. Furthermore, we note that neither letter provided a telephone number for an EEO counselor in Miami. Appellant was merely informed that if she had any questions or concerns that she was to call the Chief, Discrimination Complaints Branch, who was also located in Washington, D.C. Appellant might have felt that she was acting in accordance with A-2's instructions; therefore, she would not have had a reason to contact anyone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that during the months between July 1993 and March 1994 when the agency inexplicably accepted her complaint, appellant did not merely sit on her rights. She contacted A-2 on various occasions to discuss Complaints I and II and spoke to A-3 about accepting her case. Apparently, appellant was trying to obtain EEO counseling. The Commission, by reaching the decision herein, does not absolve appellant of any responsibility in this matter; however, we find that the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the time limitation period should be waived.</p>
