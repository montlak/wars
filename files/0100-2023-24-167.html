<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-142"><span class="space">1.</span> Shift Changes and Work Schedules</h4>
<p class="noindent">With some disabling conditions, shift changes can be particularly upsetting. This is true when the condition is controlled, in part, through maintenance of a rigid schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kozik v. USPS</span>, 01871038 (1987), the Commission found that it was discrimination to assign a diabetic to a night shift. The complainant suffered from diabetes that was controlled through both insulin and maintenance of a rigid diet and medication schedule. The Commission found that even if the employee eventually could have adapted his medication and eating schedule to a night shift, the change of shift in itself created a hazard to the employee's health. In the absence of an agency showing that the complainant's work could not be completed on the day shift, it had failed to demonstrate that the requested accommodation would impose an undue burden. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Woodly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972665 (2000), the Commission found that an agency failed to provide the complainant with the reasonable accommodation of a change to the day shift where the evidence established that the complainant's condition--paranoid schizophrenia--along with the effects of his medication substantially limited his ability to sleep.</p>
<p class="noindent">Cutting a complainant's work hours instead of granting a shift change, where granting such a change would not impose an undue hardship on the agency, is not a reasonable accommodation because it is not "effective." In <span class="Italic">Court v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10114 (2003), the Commission held that the agency should have granted the complainant's request for a change to the day shift to accommodate her depression. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Court</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC's regulations provide that "[i]n general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities." Appendix to Part 1630, at Section 1630.2(o): Reasonable Accommodation. Any reasonable accommodation "should provide the qualified individual with a disability with an equal employment opportunity"--meaning "an opportunity to attain the same level of performance, or to enjoy the same level of benefits and privileges of employment as are available to the average similarly situated employee without a disability."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at Section 1630.9: Not Making Reasonable Accommodation. Accordingly, appropriate accommodations might include job restructuring, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials, or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and/or part-time or modified work schedules.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(o)(ii); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> Appendix to Part 1630, at Section 1630.9: Not Making Reasonable Accommodation (noting that the very "reasonable accommodation requirement is best understood as a means by which barriers to the equal employment opportunity of an individual with a disability are removed or alleviated," and that such barriers "may be rigid work schedules that permit no flexibility as to when work is performed...").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency has not met this standard. When faced with medical evidence demonstrating that complainant's disability(ies) were exacerbated by working at night, OIC's suggested solution was to allow her to work the tail end of Tour 3. OIC claimed (despite evidence to the contrary) that there was no work for complainant earlier in the day, and that she therefore would have to be satisfied with this two hour shift. Considering complainant had been working a full 40 hours a week up until then, this "accommodation" of cutting her wages by 75% was hardly "effective" in extending to her an equal employment opportunity. To the contrary, this agency proposal forced complainant to make a difficult choice between her livelihood or her life, which is not an effective accommodation. Absent another available, effective reasonable accommodation, the agency was required to provide complainant the accommodation she asked for, that of working full-time during the day. It did not and is therefore liable for this failure<span class="Italic">. See Palfy v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A10087 and 01993950 (June 17, 2002) (finding that the agency unlawfully failed to provide reasonable accommodation by refusing to allow the complainant to remain working during the day shift-despite evidence that this "particular shift...was the only accommodation that was effective and did not aggravate his condition").</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a shift change will result in some inconvenience to coworkers is not an undue hardship. However, when a permanent assignment of the complainant to the day shift would result in all other employees losing their day shift assignments and also require those employees to work additional weekend and overtime hours, this does constitute an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Cyr v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A43015 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Joi J. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120150921 (2017), the agency failed to establish an undue burden where it refused to exempt the complainant, a nurse anesthetist, from on-call duties. The agency argued that eliminating on-call duties for complainant would place a burden on the other anesthesia providers, requiring them to rotate on-call duties more frequently. Distinguishing <span class="Italic">Cyr</span>, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Joi</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Cyr</span>, as exempting Complainant from on-call duties would not eliminate daytime work schedules for all of her coworkers. Further, Complainant did not perform on-call duties during the first two years of her employment, and there is no evidence in the record that this arrangement created an undue hardship during that time. While we appreciate that the more frequent on-call rotation does require Complainant's coworkers to work additional overnight and weekend hours, we find that the Agency has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that continuing to exempt Complainant from on-call duties constituted an undue hardship. Accordingly, we find that the Agency failed to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">For a shift change to be a reasonable accommodation, it must be effective in permitting the employee to perform the essential functions of her position. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120121953 (2013), the complainant alleged the agency did not provide an alternative work schedule as an accommodation. Although the Commission found that the complainant had not properly raised the issue in her formal complaint, it nonetheless determined the AWS would not be an effective accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We observe that the Agency's denial of Complainant's request for accommodation in the form of an AWS schedule was not an accepted claim in the instant complaint. Nevertheless, even if such a claim could be considered as part of the complaint, we find the material facts are not in dispute and that the AJ properly found that Complainant was not denied a reasonable accommodation and furthermore that the Agency's reasons for denying Complainant's request were neither motivated by her claimed disability or in reprisal for her protected activity. We find, as did the AJ, no evidence that permitting Complainant to continue the schedule she had from February 2009 through October 2009, would have been an effective accommodation reasonably calculated to assist Complainant in meeting the essential functions of her position. On the contrary, it was while on that very schedule that her performance and attendance declined. We consider, as did the AJ, that Complainant's medical providers requested that Complainant be permitted to return to an AWS schedule to provide Complainant with flexibility for her medical issues. We note, however, that the AWS schedule Complainant requested was not a flexible schedule and that Complainant's attendance issues attributed to her medical challenges were still a considerable problem on that schedule. While protected individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act, they are not necessarily entitled to their accommodation of choice. <span class="Italic">See Castaneda v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01931005 (February 17, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120130239 (2015), where the employee sought a change in duty hours as an accommodation. Because the employee had demonstrated performance problems, the Commission determined that the agency had not denied the complainant reasonable accommodation where it allowed her to take leave to medical treatment, but refused to change her duty hours:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant's request to change her duty hours, we agree with the AJ that the Agency accommodated her need to attend morning behavioral therapy sessions for her ADHD by allowing her to take leave. On appeal, Complainant argued that the Agency did not accommodate her by changing her duty hours. We note, however, that permitting the use of accrued paid leave, or unpaid leave, is a form of reasonable accommodation when necessitated by an employee's disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the American with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, Types of Reasonable Accommodations Related to Job Performance (as revised Oct. 17, 2002) (Guidance). Although Complainant may have preferred that the Agency change her duty hours instead, we emphasize that an employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance, Question 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant's request to stay past her 5:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. end of duty day to finish work, we agree with the AJ that the requested accommodation <span id="Page_1410"></span>would not be effective. An accommodation must be effective in meeting the needs of the individual. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance, General Principles. In the context of job performance, this means that a reasonable accommodation enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Here, the AJ credited S1's hearing testimony that there were problems with Complainant's performance even when FS1 had allowed her to work as late as she desired. Moreover, as noted above, FS1's April-August 2007 progress review indicated that Complainant had performance problems. On appeal, Complainant argued that the AJ overlooked the fact that FS1's progress review covered a time period when she underwent several surgical procedures. We note, however, that Complainant testified at the hearing about those surgical procedures and find that there is no evidence that the AJ did not properly consider that testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">A change in shift or work hours often causes some confusion for agencies in terms of performing essential job functions. When an employee can perform all essential job functions but is limited only as to the time those functions can be performed, agencies sometimes come to the conclusion that because the employee can perform the essential job functions, there is no need for accommodation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132617 (2015), this is not the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In essence, we find that a fair reading of the Agency's position in this case is that it did not unlawfully deny Complainant's reasonable accommodation request because he was not requesting an accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his position. Rather, the Agency points out that Complainant concedes, and the evidence establishes, that he had no medical restrictions that prohibited him from performing his actual job. Rather, his request went to the time of day he could perform those functions as he requested that he be provided with full-time work (8 hours per day) between the hours of 6:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. and 7:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. As a result of its view of Complainant's request, the DRAC "closed" the matter. However, we find that the Agency's view that Complainant was not making a viable reasonable accommodation request that it needed to consider and decide was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC's regulations provide that "[i]n general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities." Appendix to Part 1630, at Section 1630.2(o): Reasonable Accommodation. Any reasonable accommodation "should provide the qualified individual with a disability with an equal employment opportunity"--meaning "an opportunity to attain the same level of performance, or to enjoy the same level of benefits and privileges of employment as are available to the average similarly situated employee without a disability." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Section 1630.9: Not Making Reasonable Accommodation. Accordingly, appropriate accommodations might include job restructuring, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials, or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and/or part-time or modified work schedules. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(ii); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. Appendix to Part 1630, at Section 1630.9: Not Making Reasonable Accommodation (noting that the very "reasonable accommodation requirement is best understood as a means by which barriers to the equal employment opportunity of an individual with a disability are removed or alleviated," and that such barriers "may be rigid work schedules that permit no flexibility as to when work is performed...."). <span class="Italic">See Court v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10114 (May 15, 2003) (upholding the EEOC Administrative Judge's finding that cutting Complainant's hours by 75% was not an effective accommodation); <span class="Italic">see also Palfy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A10087 and 01993950 (June 17, 2002) (finding that the Agency unlawfully failed to provide reasonable accommodation by refusing to allow the complainant to remain working during the day shift--despite evidence that this "particular shift...was the only accommodation that was effective and did not aggravate his condition").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer. Generalized conclusions will not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship. Instead, undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. A determination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the effect on expenses and resources of the facility;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation to the employer;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, Complainant provided medical documentation indicating that he could work during the daytime hours between 6:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. and 7:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. The DRAC and Complainant agreed that he could otherwise perform the duties of his prior clerk position and perhaps many other positions at the Agency. Complainant's only medical limitation was the hours he could work and he provided a 12 1/2-hour window for which he could work 8 hours. Complainant and the Attorney gave the DRAC a variety of positions from his former supervisory position, his prior assignment as a mail processing clerk, and even custodial positions. They also noted that Complainant would take positions in Norfolk, Virginia or other locations in the Hampton Roads and Richmond areas. Complainant's Attorney also asked the DRAC for assistance in identifying even other positions to which Complainant could be assigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in response, the DRAC merely administratively closed Complainant's request. There is no indication that they considered the merits of Complainant's accommodation request or offered any alternatives. Instead, the Agency seems to rely on the temporary light duty position provided by the Plant Manager which only gave Complainant with four hours of work each shift. The record contains scant evidence about this position or why it was limited to four hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these facts, we find that the Agency has not proven that providing Complainant work during the daylight hours could have caused an undue hardship at its facilities located in the Norfolk, Hampton Roads, and Richmond areas. Therefore, we conclude that the Agency failed to show that accommodating Complainant's work schedule would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Petitioner v. Dep't. of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320110053 (July 10, 2014) (differing with the Merit Systems Protection Board and finding that the Agency failed to show undue hardship when it failed to accommodate Petitioner's request to work during the daytime constituted a violation of the Rehabilitation Act); <span class="Italic">adopted by</span> <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Dep't of Homeland Security,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 613 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency cannot, without undue hardship, grant the employee's specific request for reasonable accommodation through a shift change, it may have to consider granting the employee medical leave as an accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01910116 (1991), the Commission found the agency failed to accommodate the complainant when it suspended him for 14 days for AWOL after refusing to grant his request for daytime hours as an accommodation. Although the Commission in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> found that the agency established it would be an undue hardship to place the complainant on the day shift, it noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden of proving an inability to accommodate, which if rendered would allow the handicapped employee to perform the essential functions of the job adequately and safely, is upon the employer. Once the employer presents credible evidence that indicates that an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program and thus could not reasonably be made, the employee has the burden of coming forward with evidence concerning his or her individual capabilities and suggestions for other possible accommodation<span class="Italic">. Prewitt v. United States Postal Service, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission finds that the agency failed to consider its duty to accommodate appellant's known physical handicap when it issued the fourteen day suspension. Though the agency's doctor concluded that appellant was unable to perform the duties of Mailhandler, the agency, both before and after the doctor's recommendation, found other assignments for appellant which complied with his medical restrictions except for his need for daytime hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency maintains it was unable to accommodate the request for daytime hours, an issue exists as to whether the agency had additional obligations to accommodate his handicap. That is, though not an unlimited amount, the Commission has held that an agency is required to provide a qualified handicapped employee a reasonable amount of time off for medical reasons<span class="Italic">. See Ruiz v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880859 (May 21, 1990). The amount of leave depends on the handicapping condition and the needs of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency based the suspension on appellant's absence for all or part of eleven days between September 28, 1988 and March 7, 1989. This corresponds with the time period during which the agency twice denied appellant's requests for light duty. The agency was clearly aware of appellant's condition. While the agency may not have been able to accommodate the request for daytime hours, the Commission finds that it was unreasonable to issue a suspension given the amount of unscheduled leave used and appellant's handicap. Tolerating the leave used by appellant would not place an undue hardship on the agency's operations. Since the agency could have reasonably accommodated <span id="Page_1411"></span>appellant's handicap and appellant was able to perform the essential functions of his position, the Commission finds that appellant was a qualified handicapped person. In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate appellant's handicaps when it issued a fourteen day suspension for absences related to appellant's handicaps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is aware that appellant is no longer employed by the agency, and that, pursuant to a grievance, appellant did not serve any of the suspension. Nevertheless, the Commission cannot conclude that interim events have completely eradicated the effects of the agency's action, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> a record of the suspension may still exist in appellant's permanent personnel file<span class="Italic">. See County of Los Angeles v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). Therefore, the Commission orders the agency to expunge from appellant's permanent record any documentation concerning the fourteen day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether it is appropriate to grant leave as an accommodation where a shift change would pose an undue hardship, it is important to note the amount of leave that the agency would be required to grant. In <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, that leave would have amounted to less than 11 full days for a five and a half month period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another option to a shift change or alternative work schedule is reassigning the employee to another position. Reassignment should be considered where the shift change or alternative work schedule would cause an undue hardship or the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions of the position even with an adjusted schedule. For example, in <span class="Italic">Slawter v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120065230 (2009), the employee sought an alternative work schedule due to an allergy to chemicals in the workplace. The complainant sought a compressed work schedule to reduce her exposure time. The agency reassigned her to a position where she was not exposed to the chemicals. The Commission rejected the complainant's argument that she was not reasonably accommodated noting that she did not require the compressed schedule to perform the essential functions of her job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Frische v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120071609 (2009), the Commission found a request by the complainant, who was a supervisor, to work out of schedule to accrue credit hours in lieu of using leave was not an accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his position. In addition to finding that the accommodation request was not related to his medical conditions, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Frische</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A reasonable accommodation must be effective.<span class="Italic"> See U.S. Airways v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002). "[T]he word 'accommodation'...conveys the need for effectiveness." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "An ineffective 'modification' or 'adjustment' will not accommodate a disabled individual's limitations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the context of job performance, this means that a reasonable accommodation enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency concedes, and we presume for the purposes of analysis only and without so finding, that complainant is an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. Based on our <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the entire record in this case, the Commission finds that complainant has not established that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate him. In reaching this conclusion, we find that complainant failed to establish a link between his claimed disability and the requested accommodation. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence to show that allowing complainant to work credit hours every week would have addressed any of the limitations imposed by his claimed disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In this case, complainant contends that because of his disability, he cannot work on a regular schedule. Complainant's multiple medical conditions result in him missing work one to two days every week. Accordingly, complainant requested as a reasonable accommodation to be able to work up to 6 hours of credit time per week and then apply the earned hours without restriction to cover absences in lieu of sick leave. Upon his request for reasonable accommodation, the agency appropriately asked complainant for documentation about his disability and functional limitations to support his request. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Number 915.002, Question 6, (as revised October 17, 2002) ("Reasonable Accommodation Guidance").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By letter dated March 29, 2005, complainant provided medical documentation that stated that he suffered from tachycardia, hypoglycemia, allergies, anxiety, arthritis, bursitis, depression, fatigue, headaches, hypertension and sinusitis, but provided no information from which the agency could deduce which major life activities were affected by his conditions. On May 2, 2005, the agency requested additional information, and asked complainant to "explain how you are substantially limited in a major life activity." We find that the medical documentation from complainant's doctor did not state that complainant was limited in any life activity or that complainant had any other limitation that would require him to work credit hours to perform the essential functions of his position. Complainant's doctor only indicated that complainant would benefit from "a modified work schedule that enables him to work extra hours when able to (credit hours) in order to offset work time missed due to illness (sick leave). I fully endorse this request as a proper adjustment for his various medical problems. Unnecessarily inducing economic duress by forcing him into Leave without Pay status is contraindicated."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency is not required to provide accommodation which complainant fails to establish is necessary to enable him to perform the essential functions of his position or to gain equal access to a benefit or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">See McGuffin vs. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No, 01A14173 (December 3, 2002). We find that complainant requested the accommodation of working credit hours for reasons unrelated to his impairments; rather, he wished to avoid taking sick leave or leave without pay. Accordingly, he failed to show how working additional time to earn credit hours was a reasonable accommodation that enabled him to perform the essential functions of his position as a supervisor. Based on a review of the evidence, we find that complainant was not denied a reasonable accommodation in 2004, because he failed to establish a nexus between his asserted disabling conditions and the requested accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120055839 (October 18, 2007);<span class="Italic"> Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A42650 (September 2, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Even assuming that complainant was entitled to a reasonable accommodation, we find that the agency offered a reasonable and effective accommodation to complainant. The record shows that the agency offered complainant a non-supervisory position at the same grade and pay, which would allow complainant to work credit hours, telework, and work a flexible schedule. Complainant rejected this offer because it was a non-supervisory position. While complainant may not have been offered the reasonable accommodation of his preference, an employer is not required to provide the precise accommodation the employee or applicant wants, so long as the accommodation offered is an effective one under the circumstances of the situation. Reasonable Accommodation Guidance. In this case, we conclude that the accommodation offered complainant was reasonable and effective under the circumstances. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Boozer v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120060283 (July 24, 2007), if modifying an employee's schedule poses an undue hardship, an employer must consider reassignment to a vacant position that would enable the employee to work during the hours requested. Here, complainant has not produced evidence that there was a vacant, funded supervisory position for which he qualified at the relevant time, to which he ought to have been reassigned. While complainant desires a supervisory position, an agency is only required to place a qualified individual with a disability in a lateral position or, should one not be available, in a lower-graded position. Reasonable Accommodation Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harden v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720080002 (2011), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant by permitting her to have a flexible arrival time of between 9:00 and 9:30 or to take leave when she could not report between those times because of a sleep disorder caused by depression. The complainant was a GS-4 claims assistant and receptionist with a flexible arrival time of between 7:00 and 9:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. Any plausible argument that the agency had that the accommodation would have presented an undue hardship was eliminated because by the time of the hearing the agency had in fact granted those accommodations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120103232 (2012), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant, who had congenital missing right forearm and hand and had been diagnosed with depression, seasonal affective disorder, sleep apnea, obesity and carpel tunnel syndrome, when it revoked her flexible work schedule. As part of her treatment, the complainant was required to exercise vigorously for one hour and 15 minutes each morning. For four years, she was permitted to report to work at 10 <span class="small">A.M</span>. and work until 7 <span class="small">P.M</span>. The complainant was also permitted to earn and use credit time to cover the 30 minutes of the office's core hours that she missed. A new supervisor revoked that permission. In finding the revocation was a failure to accommodate, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lamb</span> rejected an agency contention that allowing the complainant to work after core hours presented a safety problem:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicated that Complainant, due to the combination of her medical conditions, required flexibility in the workplace to allow her to begin her work day at 10:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. The record showed that she was required to work out every morning to combat her depression. Following her workout, Complainant indicated she required additional time in order to get ready in the morning. She noted that the additional time was because of her missing right limb and carpal tunnel in her left arm and hand. As such, Complainant requested that she be allowed flexibility in morning start time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1412"></span>In its decision, the Agency found that it provided Complainant an effective reasonable accommodation in that she could arrive at work between the hours of 6:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. and 9:<span class="small">30 A.M</span>. We disagree. In her request for reasonable accommodation dated July 24, 2008, Complainant asked management for flexibility so that she may exercise per her doctor's orders in the morning for an hour and 15 minutes; get ready for work; and arrive at work at 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> We note the that the record established that Complainant merely asked that she be provided with the same flexibility she has received for four years since July 2004. Since that time, the ALJ allowed Complainant to earn credit time from 6:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. to 7:00 <span class="small">P.M</span>. which Complainant could use from 9:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. to 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> Requiring Complainant to come in by 9:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. does not provide Complainant with any accommodation. As such, we find that the Agency failed to provide Complainant with an effective accommodation when it did not allow her to continue to earn and use credit time so that Complainant could work from 10:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. to 6:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency raised the affirmative defense that Complainant posed a direct threat to herself. An employer may require, as a qualification standard, that an individual not pose a direct threat. A "direct threat" is defined as a "significant risk of substantial harm" that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The Agency has the burden of proof regarding whether there is a significant risk of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">See Massengill v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01964890 (July 14, 2000). A determination as to whether an individual poses such a risk cannot be based on an employer's subjective evaluation or, except in cases of the most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. <span class="Italic">See Selix v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Rather, after identifying the risk, the employer must conduct an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). This assessment must be based on objective evidence, not subjective perceptions, irrational fears, patronizing attitudes, or stereotypes about the nature or effects of a particular disability or of disability generally. <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03A40060 (December 13, 2004). Relevant evidence may include input from the individual with a disability, his work history or experiences in previous positions, and opinions of medical doctors who have expertise in the particular disability or direct knowledge of the individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If it is determined that an individual does pose a direct threat because of his or her disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Agency asserted in its FAD that management claimed that Complainant could not work after 6:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> because she would be the only employee left in the building. Therefore, management believed that this created a security risk. The Commission is not persuaded by management's assertions of direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency asserted that providing Complainant with a work schedule beginning at 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> constituted an undue hardship. An undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002 (revised October 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Complainant has been arriving at work at 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, since July 2004. There has been no indication that, over the four years, Complainant's schedule created an undue hardship for the Agency or that Complainant was in any threatening situation. As such, we conclude that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when, in July 2008, Complainant was required to arrive at work by 9:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> and not permitted to earn or use credit time.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency can choose among reasonable accommodations and is not required to grant the accommodation requested. Whether an accommodation is reasonable is determined by whether it is effective in allowing the individual to perform the essential job functions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140670 (2014), the Commission found that the agency did not deny the individual reasonable accommodation when it denied his request for accommodation and substituted an alternative explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not shown that the Agency wrongfully denied him reasonable accommodation. Specifically, we find that it is undisputed that the Agency provided Complainant with accommodations to his medical condition by allowing him a combination of a permanent change in schedule, some additional flexibility in schedule on occasion, and permission to use leave when needed. While this may not have been the specific accommodation Complainant wanted, he has not established that he was not provided with an effective accommodation. As noted by the AJ, Agency management adequately explained the decision not to provide Complainant with the accommodation he wanted--to change his schedule on any given day based on the need to adequately plan and schedule the work that is needed to be done for the day, especially on the three days when Complainant is one of only three MPE-9. Accordingly, we find that Complainant has not established that he was denied reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although agencies are prohibited from discriminating against individuals because of their association with individuals with disability, the prohibition against discrimination does not extend to reasonable accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Key-Scott v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120100193 (2012), the Commission found that the agency did not have to approve a shift change as an accommodation for an employee with a "special needs" child.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a change in work or reporting schedule may be a reasonable accommodation in particular situations, an agency is not required to excuse an employee from using proper reporting procedures as an accommodation. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120123390 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that this is not a case where Complainant requested to adjust his starting time. To the extent that what Complainant was really requesting was to be able to call in or report to work whenever he felt able, the Commission has found that such an accommodation is not reasonable on its face. It is not "plausible" or "feasible" for an employer to excuse chronic erratic absenteeism and tardiness by an employee who cannot provide timely notice sufficient to enable the employer to ensure adequate staffing. <span class="Italic">See Wiley v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720020105 (Sept. 15, 2003), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520040147 (Dec. 11, 2003).</p>
