<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-68"><span class="space">5.</span> Failure to Respond to Judge's Orders</h4>
<p class="noindent">Failure to respond to the orders of an administrative judge can result in sanctions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Glover v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04428 (2001), a class action involving qualified individuals with disabilities, the Commission upheld the sanction of an adverse inference against the agency that consolidation of the complainants would be impractical where the agency twice declined to comply with the judge's order to produce evidence of how many individuals were affected by the challenged promotional policy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge must, prior to issuing a sanction, give the offending party notice that a sanction is under consideration and an opportunity to cure the conduct that may lead to the sanction. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A00015 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_597"></span>Initially we consider whether the AJ properly drew an adverse inference and imposed sanctions on the agency when it failed to produce the PMS in person. The Commission's regulations afford broad authority for the conduct of hearings by AJs. 29 CFR 1614.109 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. The hearing is a part of the investigative process and completes development of a full record by allowing the parties to explain and supplement the record and, in certain instances, to examine and cross-examine witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEOC MD-110), Chapter 7, Sections I-III (November 9, 1999). An AJ's regulation of the hearing process includes the authority to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, order the attendance of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See Comer v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940649 (May 31, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a complainant or agency fails to comply with an AJ's order, an AJ may take action against the non-complying party pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3). In such circumstances, an AJ may: (1) draw an adverse inference in favor of the non-complying party; (2) consider the missing information to be favorable to the non-complying party; (3) exclude other evidence offered by the offending party; (4) provide a summary disposition in favor of the non-complying party on some or all of the issues without a hearing; and (5) take other action deemed appropriate, e.g., payment of costs and expenses by the non-complying party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Before sanctions are imposed, however, the Commission requires that the AJ issue an order to the offending party that makes clear that sanction(s) may be imposed and the type of sanctions that could be imposed for failure to comply with the order unless the party can show good cause for its action. EEOC MD-110, 7-7, fn. 4 (the AJ "must issue a notice to show cause to the party for an explanation why the sanction should not be imposed and provide an opportunity to cure the noncompliance before imposing the sanction.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter before us, we find that the AJ acted improperly in imposing a sanction on the agency without some form of prior notice and an opportunity for the agency to show good cause. In addition, we find that the AJ's order was sufficiently vague so as to justify confusion on the part of the agency, that the extent and severity of the sanction was out of line to the non-compliance, and that under the circumstances of this case, the agency showed good cause and its actions were adequate to comply with the AJ's order. The record shows that the AJ did not give any notice of possible sanctions to the agency in any of his orders or other communications, nor did he suggest that he would impose sanctions when he learned at the hearing that the PMS would only be available by telephone. The Commission requires that an offending party be provided appropriate notice of possible sanctions, i.e., a notice to show cause and what type of sanctions might be imposed. EEOC MD-110, 7-7, fn. 4; <span class="Italic">see DaCosta v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000). As a result of the AJ's failure to issue a notice to the agency, it was not afforded an opportunity to explain its actions and reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the AJ's order was vague and ambiguous, in that, it is unclear whether the AJ sought a witness to describe the process for determining who came to be listed on the selection register, if he sought a witness to testify about the ministerial, physical act of compiling of the list, or whether he expected someone to state the reasons for selection decisions. Given that all steps in the selection process was fully set out by documents in the record and, most significantly, that the PMS's function was simply ministerial, it was not unreasonable for the agency to conclude that the AJ sought testimony from the decision-makers. <span class="Italic">See</span> pp. 2-3, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Consequently, the agency presented two members of the review panel and the SO. Inasmuch as an explanation of the process was already available to the AJ, it is not clear what material testimony the PMS could provide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the AJ had followed proper procedures, we find that the AJ's decision to strike all evidence describing the selection process, including the selection plan and the collective bargaining agreement contained in the record, was too extreme under the circumstances of this case. The PMS' testimony would have been limited to the merely ministerial mathematical additions and divisions that she performed to compile the best qualified list. She was not the custodian of the subject documents, she did not have a role in implementation or oversight of the selection process, as incorrectly indicated by the AJ, and she had no authority or control concerning the collective bargaining agreement. If the AJ sought an explanation of how the best qualified list was determined, that information was contained in the record. If the AJ was looking for authentication of the documents in the record, the AJ had available the SO and two members of the review panel. If the AJ wanted to know who made the best qualified list, he already knew that the PMS calculated the results of the review panels' evaluations. If he sought verification from the PMS that she performed her mathematical computations according to the agency's selection procedures, the parties had already stipulated to that fact. Finally, if the AJ, in fact, needed to ask the PMS any questions, she was available to him by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the agency's actions were adequate to comply with the AJ's order. Given the lack of clarity in the AJ's order, the agency presented the SO and the review panel members for testimony at the hearing. In addition, if the AJ wanted to speak to the PMS, agency counsel stated she was available by telephone. The SO and review panel members were available, in addition to documents already in the record, to explain "who was responsible for deciding how the Best Qualified List was determined and who made the List."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, we vacate the AJ's sanction and turn to consideration of complainant's claim of discrimination based on sex, national origin, and in reprisal for prior EEO activity when she was not selection for the position at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that is ultimately mystifying for a sanction that imposed no detriment on the agency whatsoever, the Commission found that the Pacific Area Office of the Postal Service had blatantly acted in bad faith in disregarding the order of an administrative judge. In <span class="Italic">Bente v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40023 (2006), the complainant was subjected to a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination after a long absence from work. After investigation, the case proceeded to hearing and the complainant requested a copy of the examination report as part of his discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency objected to providing the report, as well as other discovery requests made by the complainant. With respect to the medical report, the agency, in objecting, relied upon internal policies that provided, if determined by the custodian of the records that release to the employee could cause a hardship or danger to that employee, the records could be released under seal only to the employee's physician. The administrative judge overruled the objection and ordered the agency to provide the report to the complainant. In ordering production of the report in <span class="Italic">Bente</span>, the administrative judge wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing complainant's motion to compel, I noted that the agency responded with blanket objections to every discovery request, many of which were clearly not appropriate objections to the information sought. Specifically, objecting to every discovery request on the grounds of attorney/client privilege or attorney work product and the Privacy Act is misplaced, and is extremely disingenuous with regard to many of the discovery requests. This is distasteful discovery conduct at best. Any further blanket objections asserted without a good faith basis by the agency representative will be sanctioned by me or the presiding administrative judge in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing the same internal policy and also adding Privacy Act objections. That motion was also denied. The agency did then produce a copy of the report for the complainant's representative, but attached a copy of its policy to the report, with a cover letter noting the policy was mandatory and must be followed. The complainant's representative was instructed to provide the report only to the complainant's physician and not to the complainant. Although it is not entirely clear from the record, the complainant's representative was likely a fellow employee because the decision reflects that he viewed the letter as a direct threat to his job and, accordingly, refused to even look at the documents himself. Again, it is not clear from the record, but at some point the agency also provided a copy of the report to the administrative judge <span class="Italic">in camera.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The judge in <span class="Italic">Bente</span> ultimately found that the agency had not discriminated against the complainant in ordering the fitness-for-duty examination. However, the judge did impose sanctions against the agency for its dilatory discovery conduct, though the sanction amounted to little more than requiring the agency to explain its failure to produce the report. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bente</span> upheld the sanction, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the agency's first contention on appeal, we note the agency's position that the report was available to complainant through the procedures cited in its management instructions, but that it was not provided with contact information regarding complainant's physician. The agency also maintained that a copy of the report was provided to R-2. We do not agree with the agency's position. First, we note the AJ's determination that the agency never established that it complied with its own regulations. Moreover, in his response to the agency's appeal, complainant indicated that he specifically provided the agency with information regarding how to contact his physician. He also noted the fact that the agency contacted his physician previously, on October 15, 2001, by both telephone and fax. Despite this fact, the record indicates that the agency made no effort to provide the report to complainant's physician.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ ordered the agency to provide complainant with a copy of the report. The agency's position before the hearing, during the hearing and on appeal, is that, due to its internal policies, it did not have to comply with the AJ's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to its second contention, the agency, citing the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 13, 2001) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive (MD-110), 7-7, fn. 4 (November 9, 1999), maintains that the AJ did not provide proper notice that: (1) sanctions may be <span id="Page_598"></span>imposed; or (2) the type of sanction that was being contemplated. We disagree. In her January 29, 2003 Acknowledgment Order, the AJ informed the parties that the failure to comply with the orders of an Administrative Judge could result in the imposition of sanctions pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). Moreover, the agency was advised of the type of sanctions that could be imposed, e.g., the drawing of an adverse inference, the exclusion of the agency's evidence, the issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party or other appropriate actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 13, 2003, at the close of complainant's case-in-chief, R-l made a motion to dismiss the case based on the evidence presented. The AJ, in denying the request, stated that she did not "know how any sanction that I issue is going to factor in this case. If there is an adverse inference that I draw because of the agency's discovery conduct, then that might impact the outcome of the case." Hearing Transcript at pages 261-262.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 14, 2003, the second day of the hearing, the AJ provided both R-l and R-2 an opportunity to state their positions on whether or not the agency had complied with her order that the agency provide a copy of the fitness-for-duty examination report to complainant. Hearing Transcript at pages 270-280. Specifically, they discussed the cover letter that R-l had attached to the report limiting R-2's ability to provide a copy to complainant. R-l set forth the agency's rationale that its internal regulations prohibited it from providing a copy of the report to complainant. R-2, noting the fact that the agency had the report for more than a year and a half, accused the agency of threatening him if he gave the report to complainant. R-2 mistakenly indicated that the AJ had already sanctioned the agency about this matter. Subsequently, the AJ made clear that sanctions had not been issued, but indicated that they were still under consideration. Hearing Transcript at page 279.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, the agency was on notice that the AJ was considering the imposition of sanctions. In effect, R-l was asked to show cause as to why sanctions should not be issued. His response was to set forth the same rationale that had been provided throughout the discovery process. R-l was informed that the AJ was contemplating taking an adverse inference against the agency; therefore, we find that a lesser sanction, i.e., issuing a letter of explanation to complainant, would not have prejudiced the agency in any appreciable manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency, in its third contention, maintains that the AJ abused her discretion by finding the agency acted in bad faith especially when the agency submitted the report to the AJ, <span class="Italic">in camera</span>, and permitted her to provide the report to the complainant at her discretion. The AJ indicated on the record that she never ordered the agency to provide the report to her <span class="Italic">in camera</span>. Hearing Transcript at page 273. In fact, she noted that her law clerk called R-l and told him that he needed to provide the documents as ordered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, providing the report to the AJ appears to have been another attempt by the agency to avoid complying with the AJ's discovery order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"> The agency, in its fourth contention, argues that the AJ did not have jurisdiction over the report. Specifically, the agency notes that complainant filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) regarding the voluntariness of his retirement. The AJ determined that any harm resulting from the agency's failure to provide the report related to the MSPB case, not the case before her. Although the AJ found that, "[A]n adverse inference is not an appropriate sanction because any adverse inference regarding the agency's failure to provide the exam results cannot be logically connected to the reasons for scheduling the FDD exam," she determined that complainant was entitled to the results of the examination in order to prepare for the case before her. We agree. Conceivably, there might have been information contained in the report that complainant could have used to rebut the agency's justifications for ordering the examination. We also note the AJ's determination that R-1 obtained a copy of the report in preparation for litigating the case; therefore, we find it reasonable to conclude that the report should have been provided to complainant, also.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we do not agree with the agency's characterization of the AJ's discussions with her colleagues at the Los Angeles District Office as a "personnel attack" on R-1. We note in this regard that, in a letter dated August 29, 2003, the Deputy Managing Counsel (R-3) of the agency's Pacific Area Law Department wrote the AJ that he ordered R-1 to, "[C]ontinue objecting to release of the report during the hearing and to accept the consequences of any properly made evidentiary sanction if the content of the report was deemed relevant to the claims at issue." R-3 went on to state that, "I gave this directive with the concurrence of Managing Counsel. . . ." We find it disingenuous for the agency to argue that the AJ's actions are a "personal attack" on R-1. The agency has stated in no uncertain terms that it believes that its regulations are superior to the orders of the Commission's Administrative Judges. This is a policy that is supported by the agency's legal advisors in the Pacific Area Office. Therefore, we find it appropriate that the AJ in this case be allowed to share her experiences with the other Administrative Judges in the Los Angeles District Office about the agency's policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record in its entirety, including consideration of all statements submitted on appeal, it is the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to Affirm the agency's final order in part and to Reverse the agency's final order in part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency official must write to complainant and explain: (1) why it failed to provide him with the justification it asserted for denying him the FFD exam results; (2) why he was not provided with correspondence or other documentation indicating the identity of the postal service records custodian; (3) whether or not the postal service records custodian determined that he would be harmed by the results of the FFD exam; and (4) whether the postal service records custodian requested the name and address of complainant's physician for release of the requested record.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did not explain how such a weak sanction for such flagrant conduct would deter the agency from engaging in similar conduct in the future.</p>
