<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-112"><span class="space">6.</span> Accommodation in Reassignment Position</h4>
<p class="noindent">While reassignment is an appropriate accommodation if there are no other accommodations that would allow an individual to perform essential job functions, or any accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency, reassignment, standing alone, may not be a reasonable accommodation. If an individual is otherwise qualified for a reassignment position and can perform the essential functions only with accommodation, the agency must provide the additional accommodations unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harvey G. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120132052 (2016), the complainant, an engineering technician who suffered from Myasthenia Gravis, sensory-neural bilateral hearing loss, and diaphragmatic paralysis, was required, as part of his position, to conduct onsite visits to collect design data. As his condition worsened, his physician informed the agency that extended driving could cause double vision and endanger him and others on the road. As an accommodation, the complainant sought teleworking.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency determined that the onsite visits were an essential function of his position and offered him two reassignment positions that were two to three hours from his home in Billings, Montana. The complainant declined the positions because of the distance from his home and the expense of relocating. The agency terminated the interactive process and removed the complainant for medical inability to perform.</p>
<p class="noindent">In finding that the agency failed to provide reasonable accommodation, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Harvey G</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Agency found that Complainant was an individual with a disability due to his Myasthenia Gravis condition as well as other conditions. The Agency found, however, that Complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability, and he therefore failed to satisfy the second prong. While the Agency correctly determined that Complainant is an individual with a disability, we find that the Agency erred in determining that Complainant is not a qualified individual. As discussed below, we find that the Agency erred in finding that it satisfied its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unable to engage in significant travel and meet the physical demands of the power plant/dam on-site visits. Complainant specifically requested to be allowed to telework, among other accommodations. However, S1 denied Complainant's request, indicating that face-to-face interactions to conduct on-site visits of field offices is an essential function of the position. ROI-1, at 132. Nevertheless, S1 offered Complainant the choice between two Engineering Technician (Drawing), GS-9, positions for reassignment. S1 specifically noted in the February 2, 2012, memorandum:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In searching for positions in which you are qualified and could perform the essential functions, two alternative locations were identified. Therefore, the Agency is offering you reassignment to the position of Engineering Technician (Drawing), GS-0802-09, at the Yellowtail Field Office or at the Canyon Ferry Field Office [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 127.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant declined the reassignments because they were outside of his commuting area, and the Agency did not offer him relocation costs. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 121. The Fort Smith facility is located over two hours one-way driving from Complainant's Billings, Montana home. The Canyon Ferry facility is located even farther, over three and one-half hours driving one-way from Complainant's home. Complainant did not accept the Agency's reassignment offers, asserting that an unpaid move to either location would result in a financial hardship for him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant stated that he had recently purchased a home in Billings in 2010, near his current work location. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant also maintained that such a lengthy commute would violate his medical restrictions of driving no more than an hour without a rest period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that S1, in the February 2, 2012, memorandum, specifically warned Complainant that if he refused to accept either reassignment, the Agency would most likely take action to remove him from employment for medical reasons. After Complainant did not accept the reassignments for the reasons above, the Agency carried out its warning, terminating him on September, 14, 2012. However, the Commission's regulations explicitly state that an employer must reassign an affected individual to a vacant position that is equivalent based on relevant factors, including geographical location. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance. If there is no vacant equivalent position, the employer must reassign the employee to a vacant lower-level position for which the individual is qualified. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the instant case, the two offered reassignments to Complainant were clearly not equivalent to Complainant's Billings, Montana location in terms of geographical location. The record reflects that the Agency did not continue with the interactive process after Complainant declined the reassignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that when the Agency issued the February 2, 2012, "take it or leave it" offer, with the subsequent termination, it effectively cut off the interactive process with Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Lavern B. v. Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720130029 (Feb. 12, 2015) (affirming the AJ's decision that noted, "'the [a]gency did not continue to engage in the interactive process when it was required to do so, cutting against its defense that it did everything possible to accommodate Complainant."); <span class="Italic">Harden v. Social Sec. Admin</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080002 (Aug. 12, 2011) (finding that agency improperly cut off interactive process with complainant). In the instant case, we do not find that the interactive process or the Agency's ongoing duty to accommodate Complainant was ended by virtue of Complainant's decision not to accept reassignment outside of his current geographical location.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission has recognized that an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process does not, in itself, constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Pitts v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120130039 (Mar. 13. 2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Doe v. Social Sec. Admin</span>., Appeal No. 01A14791 (Feb. 21, 2003)). Liability depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the fact that the Agency failed to properly engage in the interactive process, does not, by itself, demand a finding that Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation. Rather, to establish a denial of a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must establish that the failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, one of the accommodation requests by Complainant was to be allowed to telework from his home in Billings, Montana. Management, however, denied Complainant's request and instead offered him the choice of two reassignments outside of his geographical location. Complainant did not accept either assignment. Complainant elaborated that the reassignments to either location would require long driving commutes for him, in violation of his medical restrictions. <span id="Page_1379"></span>When Complainant declined these reassignments, the Agency did not continue with the interactive process, but instead terminated him. We find that the Agency's termination of the interactive process resulted in its failure to provide Complainant with accommodation. Specifically, had the Agency not given Complainant the ultimatum to accept one of the reassignments, and instead had continued with the interactive process in good faith, it would have clearly found an accommodation suitable to Complainant's restrictions within his geographical location. In particular, we note that Complainant specifically requested telework as an accommodation in his current position in Billings, Montana, which the Agency denied, asserting that this position required travel with face-to-face interaction. But the record reflects that, had the Agency continued with the interactive process, it would have found that it could have provided Complainant the ability to telework with either of the two offered reassignments. We note that, notwithstanding Complainant's restrictions and physical limitations, S1 nevertheless found that Complainant was qualified and could perform the essential functions of the offered reassignments. As such, given that Complainant was deemed qualified for the reassignments, had the Agency not ended the interactive process, it would have found that it could have accommodated him by providing him with telework with either of the offered positions, as became manifest with the announcement of those positions as competitive vacancies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in allowing an employee to telework an employer "may need to reassign some minor job duties or marGINAl functions (i.e., those that are not essential to the successful performance of a job) if they cannot be performed outside the workplace...." Work at Home/Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation, Question 4, available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/work-hometelework-reasonable-accommodation">http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html</a> (last modified October 27, 2005). We further note that an employer should not, however, deny a request to telework as a reasonable accommodation solely because a job involves some contact and coordination with other employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Frequently, meetings can be conducted effectively by telephone and information can be exchanged quickly through e-mail. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that Complainant established that he was a qualified individual with a disability who was denied reasonable accommodation when he was denied telework and subsequently terminated from employment. <span class="Italic">See Saner v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A13291, footnote 1 (Oct. 10, 2002) (noting that "agencies may be responsible for accommodating employees with disabilities with respect to their daily commute to work such as by modifying a work schedule, applying a work-at-home policy where it would be an effective accommodation and would not be an undue hardship, or reassignment to a facility closer to the employee's home."); <span class="Italic">Lavern B</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720130029 (agency denied complainant reasonable accommodation when it, among other things, did not grant his request to telecommute 100 percent of the time). We remind the Agency that the federal government is charged with the goal of being a "model employer" of individuals with disabilities, which may require it to consider innovation, fresh approaches and technology as effective methods of providing reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">Rowlette v. Social Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A10816 (Aug. 1, 2003); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). We believe that providing Complainant with the above reasonable accommodation furthers this goal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that Complainant is entitled to compensatory damages for the Agency's failure to accommodate him. Where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation, damages may be awarded if the agency fails to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the individual with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Gunn v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120053293 (June 15, 2007). We note that the Agency denied Complainant the opportunity to telework, terminating him instead. The Commission observes that an employer must always attempt to keep an employee fully employed as an accommodation, if doing so will not impose an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Veteran's Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111521, footnote 5 (Dec. 4, 2013), <span class="Italic">req. for recon den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520140135 (May 29, 2014). The Agency did not do so here. As such, Complainant's request for telework, as long as it did not impose an undue hardship, clearly should have been preferred over termination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We find that the Agency did not act in good faith in this case. Complainant is therefore entitled to present a claim for compensatory damages on the Agency's failure to accommodate him. <span class="Italic">See West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also Complainant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120121339 (May 8, 2015) (complainant entitled to present a claim for compensatory damages when she was in bad faith denied accommodation leading to her termination).</p>
