<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-51"><span class="space">2.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span></span> and Beyond</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern &#x0026; Sante Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006), the Supreme Court resolved the split in the circuits adopting the more expansive view of the injury requirement under the antiretaliation provision of Title VII. Sheila White, the plaintiff in the case, was hired by Burlington Northern as track laborer. A short time later, she was assigned duties as a forklift operator. Although she sometimes performed the more menial tasks of track laborer, <span id="Page_1501"></span>her primary responsibility was operating a forklift. In September 1997, she complained to Burlington officials that her immediate supervisor repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department, and had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks in front of her coworkers. The supervisor was suspended for 10 days and ordered to undergo sexual harassment training. At the same time, White's forklift operator duties were taken from her and she was assigned only track laborer duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">White filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging sex discrimination and retaliation. Two months later, she filed a second retaliation charge alleging the company had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her activities, a claim which ultimately was dropped from the complaint. A few days after Burlington Northern was notified of the second charge, White was suspended for 37 days without pay for alleged insubordination. That suspension was later rescinded through the company's internal grievance process, and White was reinstated with back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">White challenged the reassignment of duties and her suspension in U.S. district court. The jury found in her favor on both counts. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment, but the Court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span> reinstated the jury's verdict. Although the Court agreed on the outcome, it could not agree on a rationale. Noting the disagreement among the courts of appeals over the proper standards in retaliation cases, the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Seven members of the Court joined Justice Breyer in the majority opinion. Justice Alito wrote a concurring opinion affirming the Sixth Circuit's <span class="Italic">en banc</span> ruling, but disputing the majority's view of the proper standards to apply.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that three separate standards had emerged from the courts of appeals for defining the proper scope of retaliation complaints, Justice Breyer turned to the difference in the statutory language between Section 703(a), which defines unlawful employment practices on the bases of race, color, sex, national origin and religion and Section 704(a), which defines unlawful employment practices based on participation in the complaint process or opposition to a discriminatory practice. In <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern, Justice Breyer</span> observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of the substantive provision differs from that of the anti-retaliation provision in important ways. Section 703(a) sets forth Title VII's core anti-discrimination provision in the following terms:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"(1) to fail or refuse to <span class="Italic">hire</span> or to <span class="Italic">discharge</span> any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his <span class="Italic">compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment</span>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of <span class="Italic">employment opportunities</span> or otherwise adversely affect <span class="Italic">his status as an employee</span>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a). (Emphasis in oriGINAl.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704(a) sets forth Title VII's anti-retaliation provision in the following terms:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to <span class="Italic">discriminate against</span> any of his employees or applicants for employment...because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter." &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a). (Emphasis in oriGINAl.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The underscored words in the substantive provision--"hire," "discharge," "compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," "employment opportunities," and "status as an employee"--explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace. No such limiting words appear in the anti-retaliation provision. Given these linguistic differences, the question here is not whether identical or similar words should be read <span class="Italic">in pari materia</span> to mean the same thing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pasquantino v. United States</span>, 544 U.S. 349, 355, n.2 (2005); <span class="Italic">McFarland v. Scott</span>, 512 U.S. 849, 858 (1994); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Everhart</span>, 494 U.S. 83, 92 (1990). Rather, the question is whether Congress intended its different words to make a legal difference. We normally presume that, where words differ as they differ here, "'Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'"<span class="Italic"> Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court found there were several reasons to believe that Congress had intended the language differences in the statutory provisions. The first reason was that the two provisions serve different purposes. Continuing on in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern, Justice</span> Breyer explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences that its language suggests, for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well. The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 800-801 (1973). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee's efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act's basic guarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, i.e., their status. The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, i.e., their conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other than employment-related discrimination. The substantive provision's basic objective of "equality of employment opportunities" and the elimination of practices that tend to bring about "stratified job environments,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 800, would be achieved were all employment-related discrimination miraculously eliminate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer actions and harm that concern employment and the workplace. Were all such actions and harms eliminated, the anti-retaliation provision's objective would not be achieved. An employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rochon v. Gonzales</span>, 438 F. 3d, at 1213 (FBI retaliation against employee "took the form of the FBI's refusal, contrary to policy, to investigate death threats a federal prisoner made against [the agent] and his wife"); <span class="Italic">Berry v. Stevinson Chevrolet</span>, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996) (finding actionable retaliation where employer filed false criminal charges against former employee who complained about discrimination). A provision limited to employment-related actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take. Hence, such a limited construction would fail to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provision's "primary purpose," namely, "[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms." <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.</span>, 519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court found unpersuasive the arguments of <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> and the U.S. Solicitor General that the language used in Section 703(a) should be construed to similarly limit Section 704(a). The Court in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> also rejected their arguments that support for their position could be found in EEOC guidance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor can we find significant support for their view in the EEOC's interpretations of the provision. We concede that the EEOC stated in its 1991 and 1988 Compliance Manuals that the anti-retaliation provision is limited to "adverse employment-related action." 2 EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1991) (hereinafter EEOC 1991 Manual); EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1988) (hereinafter EEOC 1988 Manual). But in those same manuals the EEOC lists the "[e]ssential [e]lements" of a retaliation claim along with language suggesting a broader interpretation. EEOC 1991 Manual &#x00A7; 614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (complainant must show "that (s)he was in some manner subjected to adverse treatment by the respondent because of the protest or opposition"); EEOC 1988 Manual &#x00A7; 614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, both before and after publication of the 1991 and 1988 manuals, the EEOC similarly expressed a broad interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision. Compare EEOC Interpretive Manual, Reference Manual to Title VII Law for Compliance Personnel &#x00A7; 491.2 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Reference Manual) (&#x00A7; 704(a) "is intended to provide 'exceptionally broad protection' for protestors of discriminatory employment practices"), with 2 EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 8, p. 8-13 (1998) (hereinafter EEOC 1998 Manual), available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html</a> (as visited June 20, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (&#x00A7; 704(a) "prohibit[s] any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity"). And the EEOC 1998 Manual, which offers the Commission's only direct statement on the question of whether the anti-retaliation provision is limited to the same employment-related activity covered by the anti-discrimination provision, answers that question in the negative--directly contrary to petitioner's reading of the Act. <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Having determined that the scope of the anti-retaliation provision is broader than the scope of the anti-discrimination provision, the Court then turned its attention to defining the scope of Section 704(a). Significantly, the Court decided the provision extends beyond work-related or employment-related acts and extends to any action that might well dissuade a reasonable employee from pursuing a complaint or supporting a claim of discrimination. The Court in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The scope of the anti-retaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm. We therefore reject the standards applied in the Courts of Appeals that have treated the anti-retaliation provision as forbidding the same conduct prohibited by the anti-discrimination provision and that have limited actionable retaliation to so-called "ultimate employment decisions."<span class="Italic"> See supra</span>, at 5. B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm. As we <span id="Page_1502"></span>have explained, the Courts of Appeals have used differing language to describe the level of seriousness to which this harm must rise before it becomes actionable retaliation. We agree with the formulation set forth by the Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits. In our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, "which in this context means it well might have 'dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'" <span class="Italic">Rochon</span>, 438 F. 3d, at 1219 (quoting <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, 420 F. 3d, at 662).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We speak of material adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms. Title VII, we have said, does not set forth "a general civility code for the American workplace."<span class="Italic"> Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998);<span class="Italic"> see Faragher</span>, 524 U.S., at 788 (judicial standards for sexual harassment must "filter out complaints attacking 'the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing'"). An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 1 B. Lindemann &#x0026; P. Grossman, <span class="Italic">Employment Discrimination Law</span> 669 (3d ed. 1996) (noting that "courts have held that personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy" and "'snubbing' by supervisors and co-workers" are not actionable under &#x00A7; 704(a)). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with "unfettered access" to Title VII's remedial mechanisms. <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 519 U.S., at 346. It does so by prohibiting employer actions that are likely "to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC," the courts, and their employers. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. And normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such deterrence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2 EEOC 1998 Manual &#x00A7; 8, p. 8-13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We refer to reactions of a reasonable employee because we believe that the provision's standard for judging harm must be objective. An objective standard is judicially administrable. It avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff's unusual subjective feelings. We have emphasized the need for objective standards in other Title VII contexts, and those same concerns animate our decision here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Suders</span>, 542 U.S., at 141 (constructive discharge doctrine); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (hostile work environment doctrine).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We phrase the standard in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters. "The real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed." <span class="Italic">Oncale, supra</span>, at 81-82. A schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Washington, supra</span>, at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child). A supervisor's refusal to invite an employee to lunch is normally trivial, a nonactionable petty slight. But to retaliate by excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee's professional advancement might well deter a reasonable employee from complaining about discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2 EEOC 1998 Manual &#x00A7; 8, p. 8-14. Hence, a legal standard that speaks in general terms rather than specific prohibited acts is preferable, for an "act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others." <span class="Italic">Washington, supra</span>, at 661. Finally, we note that contrary to the claim of the concurrence, this standard does not require a reviewing court or jury to consider "the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 6 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). Rather, the standard is tied to the challenged retaliatory act, not the underlying conduct that forms the basis of the Title VII complaint. By focusing on the materiality of the challenged action and the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, we believe this standard will screen out trivial conduct while effectively capturing those acts that are likely to dissuade employees from complaining or assisting in complaints about discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">It did not take long for the Commission to begin citing <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> with approval. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Postmaster General,</span> 01A62599 (2006), the Commission reversed dismissal of a claim alleging that because of protected EEO activity the complainant was not allowed to work in the registry unit despite being assigned to that unit. It is interesting to note that the EEOC apparently does see any difference between the standard articulated in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> and its own standard articulated in previous case law despite some difference in wording. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding complainant's claim of reprisal, the Commission has stated that adverse actions need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White,</span> 548 U.S._____, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006) (finding that the anti-retaliation provision protects individuals from a retaliatory action that a reasonable person would have found "materially adverse," which in the retaliation context means that the action might have deterred a reasonable person from opposing discrimination or participating in the EEOC charge process); <span class="Italic">see also Lindsey v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999) (citing EEOC Compliance Manual, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998)). Instead, the statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Upon review, we find that claim (1) states a claim of unlawful retaliation in that such an action is reasonably likely to deter an individual from opposing discrimination or participating in the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did, however, in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> uphold dismissal of a claim that the complainant was subject to harassment when on two occasions after filing his EEO complaint he was allegedly questioned on his whereabouts during restroom breaks. The Commission found the allegations were not sufficient to support a claim of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even before <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span>, the Commission was enforcing its broad interpretation of the antiretaliation provision. For example, in <span class="Italic">Zieff v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A52515 (2006), the Commission found that an allegation by the complainant that he was called from a field office to the headquarters office ostensibly for a meeting about one matter, but was subsequently "interrogated and threatened" about misconduct allegations and further threatened with referral to the Office of Professional Responsibility in retaliation for EEO activity stated a claim for relief. The Commission specifically noted that the threats were reasonably likely to deter the complainant or others for engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another pre-<span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> case, the Commission found that the agency erred in dismissing a claim that the complainant's supervisor had, in the presence of fellow letter carriers, "spoke loudly and publicly" about her filing an EEO complaint, and that a coworker told her not to file any complaints and to keep his name out of "EEO papers." <span class="Italic">Dhillon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A55954 (2006). The Commission found that such activity was reasonably likely to deter someone from filing an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, not all actions taken by an employer rise to the level of aggrieving a complainant for purposes of filing a retaliation complaint. In <span class="Italic">Noyes v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A60764 (2006), the Commission held that an allegation that a coworker, in violation of an oral agreement, was allowed to remain at the complainant's worksite for a period of four minutes did not state a claim for relief. Likewise, the complainant's allegation that on one day, rather than making the usual work assignments, the agency asked for volunteers to work with the complainant also failed to state a claim. In both instances the Commission found this was not sufficient adverse treatment to deter a reasonable person from engaging in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In early case law, the Commission held that a complainant must show that some adverse action followed the protected activity. An employee who offered testimony from a coworker about overhearing a conversation in which agency officials threatened to terminate appellant for her EEO activities failed to state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Collins v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01831184 (1984). No adverse action was ever taken and no actual threat to appellant was made. However, the Commission also held, with virtually no discussion, that an alleged threat to an employee, to discourage him from pursuing an EEO complaint, states a claim for relief. In <span class="Italic">Hallowell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963689 (1997), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we reverse the agency's decision to dismiss allegation #2, wherein appellant alleged that he was threatened and discouraged from continuing with his EEO complaint. We have held that all employees have the right to work in an environment free from retaliatory intimidation and such allegations state a claim within our regulations because of the potential that retaliatory harassment poses to the EEO process and to those who may wish to pursue EEO remedies. <span class="Italic">Antol v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952879 (February 15, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">All courts and the Commission had previously agreed that the adverse action need not be a formal personnel action but can include an adverse impact on the terms, conditions or privileges of employment. For example, the Commission has held that an employee who was the subject of a sexual harassment investigation was adversely affected in the conditions of employment where the investigation is the result of reprisal for previous EEO activities. <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 01860416 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission held that when the alleged employment action consists of abusive language or derogatory comments, the employee must show the comments are "so 'pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.'" <span class="Italic">Harris v. Postmaster General</span>, 01882672 (1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (9th Cir. 1982)). The mere use of the word "damn" is not sufficient to show the employee was subjected to a "disadvantaging employment action." For a detailed discussion on harassment or abusive language as a term and condition of employment, see <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, the Commission found that some comments, standing alone, are so egregious that the employee is not required to show an abusive work environment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Price-Darden v. Selective Service System</span>, 01902917 <span id="Page_1503"></span>(1990), the Commission found the complainant fulfilled the adverse action requirement based on one incident where the supervisor gave the employee a loud public admonishment during which she told the employee to stop accusing her of harassment and to discuss any problems with the supervisor rather than filing EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">One court has held that a negative employment reference given for retaliatory reasons is actionable, even if the reference was not the reason the employee failed to get the job. In <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997), the court found the question of whether the employee would have gotten the job in the absence of a negative reference went to the issue of damages and not the issue of liability under Title VII. Other courts have held that a retaliatory refusal to grant a transfer can form the basis of Title VII liability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Randlett v. Shalala</span>, 118 F.3d 857 (1st Cir. 1997), and cases cited therein. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Burger v. Central Apartment Management</span>, 168 F.3d 875 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding that lateral transfer can never constitute adverse employment action).</p>
<p class="noindent">In May 1998, the EEOC adopted what appears to be its definitive position on the subject, including the proposition of <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, that the actual harm suffered goes to the issue of damages and not liability. In EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 8-II(C)(3), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some courts have held that the retaliation provisions apply only to retaliation that takes the form of ultimate employment actions. Others have construed the provisions more broadly, but have required that the action materially affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission disagrees with those decisions and concludes that such constructions are unduly restrictive. The statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. Of course, petty slights and trivial annoyances are not actionable, as they are not likely to deter protected activity. More significant retaliatory treatment, however, can be challenged regardless of the level of harm. As the Ninth Circuit has stated, the degree of harm suffered by the individual "goes to the issue of damages, not liability."</p>
<p class="noindent">Section 8 of the <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> cited above was superseded, in 2016, by EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004, B.1, but the Commission's position on the ultimate issue has not changed. The 2016 Enforcement Guidance reiterates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the employer's action would be reasonably likely to deter protected activity, it can be challenged as retaliation even if it falls short of its goal. The degree of harm suffered by the individual "goes to the issue of damages, not liability." Regardless of the degree or quality of harm to the particular complainant, retaliation harms the public interest by deterring others from filing charges. An interpretation of Title VII that permits some forms of retaliation to go unpunished would undermine the effectiveness of the EEO statutes and conflict with the language and purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Secretary of Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01982664 (1999) (making employee describe previous EEO activity in interview constitutes harm even where employee is selected for promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973618 (1998), the Commission found the employee stated a claim for relief where she alleged that personal items were taken from her desk in "order to blackmail her and so that she would back down from testimony she had provided against Person A in an EEO complaint filed against him by another employee." In <span class="Italic">Meyers v. Chairman of Panama Canal Commission</span>, 01976106 (1998), the Commission found an allegation that the agency denied reimbursement for the theft of two pet toy poodles from the complainant's living quarters in retaliation for filing an EEO complaint stated a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01973399 (1998) (remarks were found retaliatory even though they had no effect on the selection process).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brewton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24363 (2003), the Commission found that requiring the complainant to operate machinery without adequate safety training was an action sufficient to state of claim of reprisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, complainant filed a previous complaint, Agency No. 1G-761-0003-02, which is on appeal with the Commission, EEOC Appeal No. 01A21385. Second, complainant alleges that responsible management officials knew about the complaint including two of her supervisors who were angry with complainant for filing the complaint. Furthermore, in a letter dated May 17, 2002, complainant alleges that she had never worked in Automation prior to April 13, 2002, and that management assigned her to the most difficult machine. Additionally, the Overtime Make-Up Form" states that overtime is accorded based on "necessary skills," which complainant asserts that she did not have. Moreover, complainant asserts that she is classified as a "Manual Distribution Clerk" with different qualifications and skills from that of "Automation Clerks." Further, several witnesses note that employees working in Automation were instructed not to help complainant even though there was potential for harm to complainant and to the machine. Complainant further asserts that the agency disregarded manufacturer guidelines, which states that to guard against unsafe acts, that "the automated system should never be operated with untrained personnel...On-the-job training alone will not suffice." Moreover, one witness attests to a statement made by one of complainant's supervisors that she would be disciplined if she broke the machine or had any major problems. The Commission finds that complainant's claim that she was forced to work overtime in Automation without any safety instruction to constitute an alleged action that is reasonably likely to deter protected EEO activity. Therefore, we find that complainant states a claim of discrimination based on reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Leaving an employee out of a meeting is not a sufficient injury to state a claim. However, when the employee further alleges that she has been given job duties with less responsibility because of EEO activity, that allegation does state a claim. <span class="Italic">Overton v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52338.txt">01A52338</a> (2005).</p>
