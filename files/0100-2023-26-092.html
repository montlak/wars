<h2 class="h2" id="sec17-90"><span class="space">V.</span> RESTRAINT AND INTERFERENCE WITH PROCESS: <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">PER SE</span></span> VIOLATIONS</h2>
<p class="noindent">An issue that is closely akin to reprisal is the issue of restraint from exercising EEO rights or interference with EEO rights. The distinction between restraint and interference cases and reprisal cases is that no element of intent is required in the former, whereas intent is clearly an element of reprisal cases. The Commission often refers to restraint and interference cases as <span class="Italic">per se</span> violations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's handling of restraint and interference allegations remains somewhat muddled. As discussed fully in Chapter 3 in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-12-216.html#sec3-202">Spin-off Complaints</a>," prior to the adoption of Part 1614, the Commission treated allegations of improper processing of EEO complaints as a matter to be dealt with through the formal EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.262. The result was most unsatisfactory. Complainants filed "spin-off" complaints over all sorts of slights, real and imagined. Many of those complaints involved the amount of time the agency took to process the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In Part 1614, the Commission dropped previous references to restraint and interference in its regulations. Under 29 CFR 1614.101(b), it is illegal to retaliate against an employee for participation in the EEO process, or opposition to any discriminatory practice. In MD-110, at 5-14, the Commission now provides that complaints involving the improper processing of EEO complaints should be brought to the attention of the EEO director or processed as part of the underlying complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.107(a)(8) provides for the dismissal of spin-off complaints, which are complaints about the processing of existing complaints. It provides instead that complaints about the processing of existing complaints should be referred to the agency official responsible for complaint processing, and/or processed as part of the original complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency should not treat complaints over the improper processing of EEO complaints by initiating a new complaint process. <span class="Italic">Cyrtzer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01930613 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">This is all well and good, but it still has left an uncertainty over complaints alleging that an agency's actions have the effect of restraining or interfering with a complainant's EEO rights. If a complaint alleges restraint or interference with the EEO process, as opposed to making allegations about the processing of a complaint, the complaint should be handled as any complaint of discrimination or reprisal under Part 1614 of the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01966574 (2000), the complainant was intimidated by agency officials following a visit to the agency's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) to obtain information about her rights. Two hours after the complainant's visit to the OCR, the Acting Director and the RMO came to see the complainant and asked her if she had filed an EEO complaint. The complainant's and RMO's respective versions of what occurred in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> were as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that he told her, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he had just learned about it from "a friend of a friend"; that "everyone knows that disgruntled employees file law suits and that he could destroy [complainant]"; that he could send out a press release: "Disgruntled Employee's Office Reorganized"; that the agency would pay for his attorney; and that he would surely win and would "beat [her] hands down."...The RO acknowledged visiting complainant after he learned from secretarial "rumor" that she was considering a complaint. He denied threatening her if she filed a lawsuit, but indicated that he did say that "look, this stuff is <span id="Page_1544"></span>baseless," that either he or the agency would hire an attorney to defend him, and that he would "win this" because the allegations were untrue....</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the agency's Acting Associate Administrator for the Office of Policy and Analysis (AA) came into the complainant's office the following day and asked the complainant if she planned to file an EEO complaint. The AA told the complainant that filing a suit would be like a "nuclear attack," and that the RMO was "'ruthless' and would use everything legal and illegal to discredit her case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> found that the agency's actions constituted unlawful interference with the complainant's ability to exercise her rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The three separate visits to complainant's work area by three different members of NTIA management shortly after her initial visit to the OCR were intimidating in nature and clearly qualify as overt attempts to discourage her from using the EEO process. Even if we credit the RO's version of what occurred, both the fact that his visit followed so swiftly on the heels of complainant's OCR activity and the substance of his acknowledged remarks are implicitly intimidating, especially given the relative balance of power between him and complainant (a GS-12 nonsupervisory employee). In view of our holding herein, we will order that all agency officials involved in these violations receive training in their responsibilities under the Commission's regulations to refrain from such restraint on employees' exercise of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that attempting to dissuade an employee from filing an EEO complaint is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Commission's regulations against restraint or interference with the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922440 (1994) (attempts by management to dissuade the employee from filing a sexual harassment complaint are "unequivocally prohibited by the regulations...."). A supervisor's statements during a staff meeting regarding "record-keeping, legal sufficiency, and the supposed futility of exercising statutorily protected rights" constituted <span class="Italic">per se</span> reprisal. <span class="Italic">Mindy O. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720150010 (2016). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mindy O</span>. added that the supervisor's "statements demonstrate, at best, an ignorance of his responsibilities under EEO laws and, at worst, blatant disregard for the rights of individuals under those laws."</p>
<p class="noindent">"Actions, such as warning a complainant not to make false accusations or risk disciplinary action may also amount to retaliation on its face. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manuel R. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120142958 (Dec. 2, 2016) (declining to find retaliation where, after a hearing, the record failed to show that the named responsible management official warned complainant not to make false allegations or risk losing his job). <span class="Italic">Shelby R. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020005406 (2022). <span class="Italic">Shelby R</span>. complained to a Director at the agency that his manager refused his request for more hours and instead gave them to a Caucasian coworker. In response, according to the complainant, the Director warned that "if anything [he] said was untrue, [he] would be terminated from [the Agency]." Finding the comment retaliatory, in <span class="Italic">Shelby R</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we certainly understand both the Assistant Director concerns and the Agency's arguments on appeal, we nevertheless find the underlying warning in claim 9 to be retaliatory. We have long held that the truth or falsity of a complainant's allegations goes to the merits of the complaint and is irrelevant as to whether he or she can bring a claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Zhang v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01982202 (Apr. 28, 1999). We are particularly concerned that the broad warning made by the Assistant Director could dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected EEO activity for fear that an unsuccessful EEO complaint could result in disciplinary action. That was the issue of concern in <span class="Italic">Manuel R., supra</span>. While the complainant in that case was unable to prove that the accused management official uttered the alleged warning, there is no such dispute here. We, therefore, conclude that the Agency subjected Complainant to unlawful retaliation as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kaarup v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120072592 (2009), the Commission found a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where a second-line supervisor called the complainant into his office and asked why he did not speak to the supervisor or use the negotiated grievance process before contacting a counselor. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kaarup</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that on April 28, 2006, complainant contacted an EEO Counselor about an alleged act of violence by S1. On May 5, 2006, S2 had a meeting with complainant wherein S2 essentially criticized complainant for contacting an EEO Counselor instead of contacting S2 first, or proceeding through the negotiated grievance procedure. S2 averred in his affidavit that his suggestions to complainant were just about "proper protocol."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that the actions of a supervisor may be <span class="Italic">per se</span> reprisal where he or she intimidates an employee and interferes with the employee's EEO activity in any manner. <span class="Italic">See Binseel v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970584 (October 8, 1998); <span class="Italic">Yubuki v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920778 (June 4, 1993). We find that S2's comments to complainant constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII and the Commission's regulations by interfering with his rights to pursue remedies for violations of equal employment opportunity laws. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.101(b); <span class="Italic">see Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006). Complainant states that he intended to contact the EEO Counselor about age discrimination. We note that complainant could not have prevailed on this underlying claim because he was not over the age of 40, and thus not in the class of persons protected by the statute. However, a person is protected against retaliation for opposing perceived discrimination if he or she had a reasonable and good faith belief that the opposed practices were unlawful. Thus, it is well-settled that a violation of the retaliation provision can be found whether or not the challenged practice ultimately is found to be unlawful. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation, &#x00B6; 8-11.B.3.b, page 8-8 (May 20, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120516 (2015) (battalion commander committed <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation when he instructed complainant and others not to go to EEO office without coming to him first); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120140624 (2015) (supervisor expressed disappointment that complainant did not come to him first and try to work things out).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even comments intended as jokes that specifically reference a complainant's EEO activity can constitute <span class="Italic">per se</span> violations. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Charlie K. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0120142315 (2017), where the complainant's supervisor told the complainant that leadership had spent half of a meeting discussing the complainant's EEO complaint. The Commission dismissed the supervisor's defense that he was only joking with the complainant as irrelevant, but also noted that not all comments referencing an EEO complaint are necessarily <span class="Italic">per se</span> violations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant engaged in EEO activity when he provided a January 28, 2002, declaration in connection with the investigation of an EEO complaint filed by another Agency employee. He also engaged in protected activity when he filed the instant complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that S1 told him that managers had spent half of an October 2009 management discussing Complainant's EEO complaint. S1, who acknowledge making the statement, asserted that he was just joking with Complainant and that his comment was not retaliatory. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Comments that, on their face, discourage an employee from participating in the EEO process violate the letter and spirit of the EEOC regulations and evidence a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the law. <span class="Italic">Binseel v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970584 (Oct. 8, 1998) (complainant told that filing an EEO suit was "wrong way to go about getting a promotion"). Agencies have a continuing duty to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity in their policies and practices. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.101(a). This duty extends to every aspect of agency personnel policy and practice in the employment, development, advancement, and treatment of employees. Agencies are obligated to insure that managers and supervisors perform "in such a manner as to insure a continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal employment opportunity." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(5); <span class="Italic">see also Vincent v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120072908 (Aug. 3, 2009), <span class="Italic">request for recon. denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 0520090654 (Dec. 16, 2010) (<span class="Italic">per se</span> violation found where supervisor mentioned EEO complaints had been filed and said, "What goes around, comes around"); <span class="Italic">Woolf v. Dep't of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083727 (June 4, 2009) (<span class="Italic">per se</span> violation found when a labor management specialist told the complainant, "as a friend," that her EEO claim would polarize the office); <span class="Italic">Binseel v. Dep't of the Army, supra</span>. When a supervisor's behavior has a potentially chilling effect on the use of the EEO complaint process the ultimate tool that employees have to enforce equal employment opportunity the behavior is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1's "joke" about managers discussing Complainant's EEO complaint at a management meeting is reasonably likely to deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity and has a potentially chilling effect on the EEO process. Employees have a right to file EEO complaints and to engage in protected EEO activity without being subjected to comments that managers wrongly intend to be "joking" or "humorous." Managers should never joke about or criticize an employee's protected EEO activity. Nor should managers discuss an employee's EEO activity at a management meeting. While there may be circumstances where it is appropriate for specific managers to discuss the substance of an employee's EEO complaint in furtherance of processing or resolving a complaint, it is never appropriate for an employee's EEO activity to be the subject of general discussion. We find that S1's comment therefore constitutes a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080665 (Nov. 4, 2009) (supervisor's comments about the stress that he experienced because of complainant's EEO complaints had a potentially chilling effect on the exercise of EEO rights and constituted <span class="Italic">per se</span> reprisal); <span class="Italic">Switzer v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120062080 (supervisor's comment that complainant's EEO complaints were "unfounded" violated Title VII by interfering with complainant's EEO rights); <span class="Italic">see also Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation</span> at II.B.1. ("[r]etaliation expansively reaches any action that is 'materially adverse,' meaning any action that might well deter a reasonable person <span id="Page_1545"></span>from engaging in protected activity"). Accordingly, we will order the Agency to post a notice of this finding and to provide EEO training to managers at DFO.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, the Commission held that it is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the regulations to prohibit EEO counselors from being appointed as acting supervisors. <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Secretary of Treasury, IRS</span>, 05930570 (1994). The Commission found the agency's policy prohibiting such assignments constituted impermissible restraint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In both the <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> and <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> cases, there was no discussion of intent to retaliate. The Commission found the agency's actions in each case constituted interference with the EEO process, irrespective of the agency's motivation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Comments constituting <span class="Italic">per se</span> violations do not necessarily have to be made directly to the complainant to be actionable. In <span class="Italic">Matt A. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120161100 (2016), the Commission found a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where the complainant was made aware of comments made by his second-line supervisor to his first-line supervisor that the complainant was a "troublemaker," associated him with a coworker who had filed an unrelated EEO complaint and referred to both as "ring leaders." Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Odilia M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120150311 (2016), seemed to suggest that any reference to an employee's allegations of discrimination contained in a proposed disciplinary action will be viewed as a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation. <span class="Italic">Odilia M</span>. involved a proposed 30-day suspension of the complainant based upon emails sent by the complainant to her supervisor accusing him of harassment and discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Odilia M</span>. found immaterial the supervisor's contention that he proposed to discipline the complainant for the "tone" of her emails rather than the content:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, S1 issued a Complainant a proposed 30-day suspension for sending him six emails, including one with the subject RE: RESPONSE TO [S1] perceived Workplace Bullying and Harassment, another that "was confrontational and disrespectful while accusing your supervisor of discrimination," and a third in which Complainant stated, "I expressed that I perceived that you were discriminatory towards African-American females." Although S1 said that he issued the proposed suspension because of the "confrontational and disrespectful" tone of Complainant's emails, rather than their content, S1 specifically citing Complainant's allegations of harassment and discrimination in a disciplinary proposal has a chilling effect on the EEO process. Moreover, employees accusing their supervisors of harassment and discrimination inherently involves confrontation, so it would have been difficult for Complainant to avoid a "confrontational and disrespectful" tone. Further, although the Agency's table of penalties recommended between a reprimand and removal for a first offense of this type of charge, the length of the proposed suspension appears excessive, given Complainant's alleged conduct. Accordingly, we find that the Agency's issuance of the proposed 30-day suspension was a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation,</p>
<p class="noindent">It is interesting to note in <span class="Italic">Odilia M</span>. that despite its rejection of the supervisor's "tone" argument in regards to the complainant's reprisal claim, even the administrative judge commented on the complainant's "confrontational and disrespectful towards him throughout the hearing" and lack of "respect for authority" in finding that the complainant likely contributed to any hostility in her work environment, and the Commission credited the administrative judge's conclusion in that regard. But, an angry tone along with a comment about the complainant's EEO complain was enough in <span class="italic">Tomeka T. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 2020000390 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Claim 7, the record indicates that at a meeting on June 16, 2016, S2 discussed Complainant's EEO case with other Agency officials including S1. Complainant was in attendance at the meeting. According to the record, S2 repeatedly referred to Complainant's EEO case in an angry voice. The record further indicates that S1 admitted to saying directly to Complainant that he did not commit the misconduct she alleged and that he was offended by the allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 7, we concur with the Agency's own finding that S2's comments constituted a <span class="italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII's prohibition of reprisal discrimination at the June 8, 2016 meeting when he expressed his anger regarding Complainant's EEO claims. S2's comments and conduct were reasonably likely to deter Complainant, or any other employees who were present at the time, from personally engaging in the EEO process. After our own review of the record, we find that the Agency properly found that it had subjected Complainant to unlawful retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Renato K. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120141861 (2016), found a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where the complainant's supervisor (and alleged discriminating official) asked a coworker of complainant's whether she thought he (the supervisor) was prejudice or if his actions were prejudicial. When the coworker asked the supervisor why he was asking these questions, the supervisor responded that the complainant had filed an EEO complaint against him. While in his office, the coworker also observed a copy of the complainant's complaint on the supervisor's desk and noted that it lay there in plain view for three days. These actions, the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Renato K</span>. were reasonably likely to deter the complainant and others from engaging in protected EEO activity and constituted <span class="Italic">per se</span> retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520140168 (2014), the Commission found that the agency may have committed a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where a management official referenced the complainant's civil action in response to a reference request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that, when Complainant's former supervisors provided their responses to OPM regarding Complainant's former employment with the Agency, they divulged information about Complainant's prior EEO activity. According to OPM's Report of Investigation, one supervisor stated "After [Complainant's] termination...the [Complainant] filed a civil action against [the Agency because Complainant was] older and minority." <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM's Report of Investigation at 2. OPM's reports goes on to read, "[The supervisor) does not believe [Complainant] is honest based on his filing a suit for reasons not valid to [the supervisor]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM's report cites the other supervisor as stating that "[Complainant] filed a lawsuit against the Agency for discrimination based on [Complainant] being terminated from [the Agency] for being an older Hispanic." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3-4. Divulging such information may discourage an employee from participating in the EEO process, may violate the letter and spirit of the EEOC regulations, and may be evidence a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the law. <span class="Italic">Binseel v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970584 (Oct. 8, 1998) (complainant told that filing an EEO suit was the wrong way to go about getting a promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072908 (2009), the Commission emphasized that a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation that would tend to discourage an employee from exercising or pursuing EEO rights does not require a finding of intent. In that case, a supervisor, during an EEO talk, told a group of employees that supporting each other in the EEO process was "good," but "what goes around, comes around." The Commission rejected the agency's argument in <span class="Italic">Vincent</span> that the supervisor had no intent to retaliate and, in fact, had no knowledge of complainant's EEO activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation cannot be established because S had no knowledge of complainant's protected activity. The argument is unavailing. As noted above, the Commission has held that the mere utterance of certain words can be a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of law. Even without specific knowledge of complainant's protected activity, S's blanket admonition that employees' mutual support in EEO matters could create a backlash was the type of statement that would reasonably have had a chilling effect on the complainant and her fellow employees. However, as the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Binseel v. Department of the Army,</span> the finding of a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation in this regard would not automatically entitle complainant to individual relief Such relief would require a finding that complainant actually suffered adverse treatment because of her support of CW1's EEO matter.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132430 (2015) (single comment about complainant's representation of coworkers in EEO complaints in presence of others constituted <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120113331 (2014), the Commission explained that with a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation the complainant was entitled to no relief, but it could order training as a prophylactic measure:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to GS's assertion, it is not "unprofessional" for an individual to allege that he or she has been subjected to discrimination or retaliation for protected activity. Rather, it is a statutorily protected right. The statements of FTO and SA-1 demonstrate a further lack of regard for Complainant's statutory rights. ASAC expressed concern about the stress and frustration that FTO and SA-1 experienced, but she did not address whether she took any steps to ensure that they understood and respected Complainant's right to engage in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the statements of GS and others evidence, at best, ignorance of their responsibilities under Title VII; at worst, blatant disregard for the rights of individuals under Title VII. This attitude on the part of managers is reasonably likely to keep them from carrying out their obligations to insure a continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal employment opportunity. The Agency is strongly reminded that there is no place for this type of behavior from any manager of the federal government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the record does not support a finding that Complainant has established a claim of discrimination for which he is entitled to individual relief, the record abundantly supports a finding that there has been a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII. Accordingly, we will order the Agency to provide EEO training to personnel at its ICE Office of Investigations in San Diego, California, and to post a notice of this finding.</p>
<p class="noindent">Upon finding a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ivan V. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120141416 (2016), ordered the agency to conduct an investigation into the complainant's entitlement to compensatory damages, to provide specialized training for all managers, and to consider taking disciplinary action against the responsible management officials. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ivan V</span>. explained the circumstances that constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that two supervisors pulling Complainant into an office and asking if he said that he planned to "play the Latino card" in the context of investigating a complaint from another employee <span id="Page_1546"></span>constitutes a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation because such behavior could have a chilling effect on the use of the EEO process. After a review of the entire record, we find that Complainant established that he was subjected to reprisal discrimination when S1 and S2 asked Complainant if he said that he planned to "play the Latino card."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an administrative judge's <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation finding where the complainant's supervisor, during a work meeting, accused the complainant of providing false information in her EEO complaint, and ordered the agency to provide training to and consider discipline of the supervisor. <span class="Italic">Celine D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120150178 (2017).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Zenia M. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120121845 (2015), the Commission found a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where the agency accessed the complainant's EEO files as part of an investigation involving her use of email:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the disclosure of Complainant's EEO records in the manner described by the EEOCM would be reasonably likely to deter Complainant and others from engaging in protected EEO activity. As articulated by the EEOCM, the Agency's policy is that, if an employee is suspected of some misconduct, in this case not respecting the chain of command structure, or engaging in Privacy Act or HIPPA violations, the Agency may examine the employee's EEO documents. The justification offered by the EEOCM is that these documents are part of a formal investigation and therefore became government property. He also noted that the documents in the Reports of Investigation and other documents Complainant submitted were generated by her, management, and witnesses on government computers and could be shared with individuals who have a need to know.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that, if the Agency believed that Complainant had violated a law or policy, she could be subjected to an investigation like any other employee. In this case, however, the Agency failed to provide a plausible explanation for why her EEO records pertaining to Complaints Nos. HHS-IHS-0212-2007 and HHS-HIS-0050-2009 needed to be reviewed, if the concern was with her e-mails. The only reasonable explanation is that the Agency was seeking to deter her protected EEO activity and that of others. We note in this regard that in one of the e-mails that she sent to the Deputy Director, Complainant indicated that she might be subjected to "continued harassment." According to the EEOCM, this is the e-mail that he turned over to management because it violated the chain of command, and which appears to have led to the investigation of Complainant and the review of her EEO files (Claim 2). Thus, Complainant's complaints about "continued harassment" to the Deputy Director resulted in her being investigated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the record demonstrates that there was a blatant mishandling of Complainant's EEO complaint files. The fact that information may have been generated from government computers does not justify the Agency's disclosure policy. We find that management mishandled Complainant's EEO records and that these actions were reasonably likely to deter her and other employees from engaging in EEO activity. We also note the Agency's admission that Complainant's EEO files were left unsecured in the CEO's office for a period of time. Consequently, we find that Complainant demonstrated that she was subjected to reprisal with regard to claims 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="noindent">The notion that a complaint of interference with EEO rights does not require a showing of intent has been embraced by at least one court. In <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities</span>, 957 F.2d 424 (7th Cir. 1992), the court struck down a facially neutral policy requiring the cancelation of all grievances whenever a claim over the same personnel action was filed in another forum. In that case, the policy was used to cancel a grievance where the employee also filed a complaint under the ADEA. The court specifically found that the employer's intent was not the issue. Rather, because the policy had the effect of imposing restrictions on those who exercise EEO complaint rights, it constituted interference with the process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission followed the <span class="Italic">Board of Governors</span> case in <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Secretary of Social Security Administration</span>, 01976770 (1998). In <span class="Italic">Abrams</span>, the agency had a policy of denying hardship transfers to anyone with a pending EEO complaint. In <span class="Italic">Abrams</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[J]ust as in <span class="Italic">Board of Governors</span>, where the suspension of the employer's grievance process for any claim where an EEO complaint had been filed constituted unlawful retaliation for utilizing the EEO process, so too, does an agency's policy of denying employees who have utilized the EEO process access to the Ombudsman's Office constitute unlawful retaliation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the District Court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">General Motors</span> is directly applicable to the facts of the instant appeal. In General Motors, the District Court found that GM committed a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII's anti-retaliation provision when it precluded employees who had filed EEO complaints from utilizing GM's internal dispute resolution process. The Court noted that the denial of access to a benefit of employment, as opposed to a contractual right, also violates Title VII<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1126, fn. 3; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a); <span class="Italic">Hishon v. King and Spaulding</span>, 467 U.S. 67, 69 (1984). For the foregoing reasons, we hold that it is unlawful to condition an employee's access to an agency's Ombudsman's Office, a privilege of employment which should be made available to all employees, on the non-existence of an EEO complaint, and note that such a policy would have a chilling effect on an employee's right to pursue a EEO complaint of discrimination. Further, the agency's decision to deny appellant access to the agency's ombudsman's Office because he filed an EEO complaint constituted unlawful retaliation in violation of Title VII<span class="Italic">. See supra Board of Governors and General Motors</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that the Second Circuit rejected a similar argument by the EEOC when it concluded that the New York City Transit Authority's policy of referring EEO complaints to its Law Department when brought to the employer's EEO office for investigation and mediation did not violate the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII. <span class="Italic">United States v. New York City Transit Authority</span>, 97 F. 3d 672 (2d. Cir 1996). The Second Circuit concluded that mediation and settlement are forms of defensive tactics employers utilize to combat charges of discrimination, and that "[r]easonable defensive measures do not violate the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII, even though such steps are adverse to the charging employee and result in differential treatment."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 677. The Second Circuit noted that the employer's defensive measures do not affect an employees working conditions or compensation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant appeal, however, the agency's Ombudsman's Office is neither characterized as, nor designed to be an office charged with combating charges of discrimination. To the contrary, the Policy statement of the Ombudsman's Office states that "[the Ombudsman's] involvement...will include working with various agency officials to ensure consistency and fairness in handling Agency-wide issues and problem resolution." By its own terms, the agency's Ombudsman's office is not designed to be a defense mechanism to charges of discrimination brought by employees. Thus, without addressing the propriety of the Second Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">New York City Transit Authority</span>, we find that it is distinguishable from the facts herein, and is therefore inapplicable to the facts of the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite this confusion about the meaning of the new prohibition on using the complaint process to raise allegations that relate solely to the agency's handling of an EEO complaint, case law under the 1992 version of Part 1614 seemed to support the position that the Commission still would entertain such complaints where some concrete harm is alleged. In <span class="Italic">Barlow v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01941951 (1994), the Commission stated, "EEO MD-110 also provides that the agency must process the complaint where the aggrieved person alleges that (s)he was treated differently <span class="Italic">or that (s)he is being adversely affected by a policy or practice having a discriminatory effect on the processing of the complaint on a basis protected by the laws which EEOC enforces.</span> EEO MD 110 at 4-8, 4-9. <span class="Italic">Cyrtzer v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930613 (March 22, 1993)." (Emphasis added.) <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Person v. Postmaster General</span>, 01940545 (1994). Whether or not this trend will continue under the 1999 amendments remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Porter v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956277 (1996), however, the Commission reserved judgment on whether an allegation that an EEO counselor delayed in going forward with a complaint and attempted to persuade the complainant to withdraw his request for counseling stated a claim for relief. The complainant alleged the counselor's actions were taken because of race and prior EEO activity. The Commission remanded the case for development of the record on whether the complainant was aggrieved by these alleged actions. The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Porter</span> is mystifying; it seems the complainant definitely would have been injured in fact by the delay and the attempt to dissuade him from pursuing his complaint. Certainly, those kinds of activities would tend to interfere with or restrain EEO activity and the only question should be whether they occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a distinction between complaints of reprisal and complaints of restraint of or interference with protected activity, but the confines are not precisely clear, as evidenced by the Commission's explanation in <span class="Italic">Lozoya v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01944586 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to 1-a, while appellant's credible testimony and lack of rebuttal lead us to conclude that RA and his deputy attempted to issue a letter of reprimand to the appellant because she sought to invoke the EEO process, for reasons not clear, they abandoned that avenue of redress when appellant's immediate supervisor resisted. We find therefore that appellant fails to establish that she was aggrieved by the action. However, the inquiry need not end here. Restraint of or interference with an individuals protected EEO activity is prohibited by Section 704 of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.261, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103(a). The proximity of the effort to issue a letter of reprimand to the counselor's contact with the RA served at least to chill appellant's efforts to pursue her EEO complaint and interfered in the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Shirley Garcia v. Treasury</span>, 01932967, August 26, 1993 (chilling effect actionable even where appellant not aggrieved); <span class="Italic">See also Mary Ellen Padin v. USPS</span>, 05940032, July 28, 1994 (interference in the EEO process), <span class="Italic">Gerald Holmes v. USPS</span>, 01920196, July 2, 1992 (in considering appellant's contention of reprisal discrimination we are not necessarily confined to the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case analysis since EEOC <span id="Page_1547"></span>regulations prohibit interference with the EEO process and failure to follow regulations is interference).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission attempted to clarify its position in <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01955276 (1997). In that case, the complainant alleged that two managers threatened her with lawsuits if she continued to pursue an EEO complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Boyd</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have recognized that the filing of a state court action for defamation in retaliation for an employee's exercise of Title VII rights violates the anti-retaliatory provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Levi Strauss &#x0026; Co.</span>, 515 F. Supp 640, 623 (N.D. Illinois 1981); and <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Virginia Carolina Veneer Corp</span>., 495 F. Supp. 775, 777-778 (W.D. Virginia 1980); <span class="Italic">see also Berry v. Stevinson Chevrolet</span>, 74 F.3d 980, 986 (10th Cir. 1996) (malicious prosecution in retaliation for filing an EEO complaint violates 5704 of Title VII). The courts have so held because retaliation, whether in the form of a subsequent discharge or a court proceeding, places an added cost on the exercise of statutory rights and, as such, has a chilling effect on the exercise of those rights. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Levi Strauss &#x0026; Co.</span>, 515 F. Supp 640, 642-643 (N. D. Illinois 1981); <span class="Italic">accord Garcia</span> <span class="Italic">v. Lawn</span>, 805 F.2d 1400, 1405 (9th Cir. 1986) (retaliation is likely to cause irreparable harm to the public interest in enforcing the law by deterring others from filing charges). Similar considerations apply in cases arising under the anti-retaliation provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) because the ADEA also depends on employees and applicants for employment to initiate the administrative and/or judicial process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in the instant case, the appellant is not alleging that the agency's managers filed a civil action against her in retaliation for her informal complaint of discrimination. Instead, the appellant is alleging that manager 2 told her in the presence of the facility manager that he would bring a legal action against her if she pursued an EEO complaint against him, and manager 1's attorney wrote her that she would face legal action for slander if she pursued her EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If proven true, these acts would constitute unlawful interference with the exercise of the appellant's EEO rights because they would have placed an undue and potentially chilling burden on the exercise of those rights: the need to weigh the risk of incurring the cost of defending against a slander action against the desirability of obtaining a remedy for the alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.</span>, 117 S. Ct. 843, 848 (1997) (a primary purpose of anti-retaliation provisions is maintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms); <span class="Italic">see also Marr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941344 (June 27, 1996) (a supervisor's attempt to dissuade an employee from participating as a witness constituted unlawful interference with the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The mere fact that the appellant filed the instant formal complaint does not defeat her claim of unlawful interference with the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921027 (March 18, 1993) (merely because the complainant filed an EEO complaint despite the EEO Office's lack of assistance does not mean that the complainant is no longer aggrieved).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these above-stated reasons, the Commission finds that the appellant's allegation--that the agency twice interfered with her right to file an EEO complaint--states a claim of retaliation in violation of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.101(b) and the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII and the ADEA. Accordingly, the Commission reverses the agency's dismissal of the appellant's allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Potential<span class="Italic"> per se</span> Violation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In similar cases of alleged interference with the EEO process under 29 CFR Part 1613, the Commission found that the agency's actions constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Commission's anti-retaliation regulation, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.261, and ordered appropriate remedies. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930774 (June 23, 1994) (a second-level supervisor called a complainant into his office and told her he was upset with her for filing an EEO complaint); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922440 (April 14, 1994) (a manager attempted to dissuade a complainant from filing a sexual harassment complaint about the actions of the ICS; the ICS implied that he would not help the complainant find a better job if she filed an EEO complaint about his actions); <span class="Italic">Crespo v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920842 (September 17, 1993) (a manager mentioned the complainant's prior EEO complaints in a supervisory evaluation); and <span class="Italic">Yubuki v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920778 (June 4, 1993) (supervisor's intimidation constituted unlawful interference with the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These Commission cases are precedent to be followed in cases arising under 29 CFR Part 1614 as well as under 29 CFR Part 1613, even though the anti-retaliation provision of 29 CFR Part 1614 is worded differently than the anti-retaliation provision of 29 CFR Part 1613.1<span class="Italic"> See</span> "Section-by-Section Analysis," 29 CFR Part 1614, 57 Federal Register 12634, 12642 (1992) (the change in language is purely editorial in nature and does not affect the coverage of retaliation as a prohibited practice under the statutes and the regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission made these <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation findings after investigations of the complaint allegations. Indeed, in most cases the question of motivation is a question of fact to be determined after an investigation and/or a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., EEOC v. Levi Strauss &#x0026; Co.</span>, 515 F. Supp at 644 (to establish the propriety of an injunction, the Commission must demonstrate that the defamation action was filed for a retaliatory purpose).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in one case, the Commission found that a manager's actions constituted a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> violation of the anti-retaliatory regulation prior to an investigation. <span class="Italic">Jasper v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920370 (August 7, 1992) (beyond dispute that the Postmaster stated at a supervisors' meeting that too many managers were filing EEO complaints and that these filings would do the managers no good). In another case, the Commission found a violation of the anti-retaliatory regulation when the allegation was raised during the processing of a complaint but not formally addressed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Marr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941344 (June 27, 1996) (supervisor's attempts to dissuade an employee from participating as a witness in the EEO process constituted unlawful interference with the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case the appellant alleges more than that the alleged interference with the exercise of her EEO rights states a claim of retaliation. The appellant alleges, in addition, that the alleged interference is part and parcel of her hostile work environment claim. <span class="Italic">See Cobb v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970077 (March 13, 1997) (the agency should have treated the complainant's multiple allegations of harassment as one hostile work environment claim and considered the alleged incidents as examples of the on-going hostile work environment to which the complainant allegedly was being subjected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in order not to divide the appellant's hostile work environment claim into separate parts, the Commission chooses not to address at this time whether the October 21, 1994 letter, on its face, violated the anti-retaliatory provisions of Title VII, the ADEA, and 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.101(b). <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Virginia Carolina Veneer Corp</span>., 495 F. Supp. at 777 (summary judgment granted based on a finding that the allegations contained in a state court action constituted an admission of a retaliatory motive where the alleged defamatory writings, statements or actions were made only to the EEOC, and to the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission reminds the agency that, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a) (5), it has a duty to provide training and advice to managers and supervisors to assure their understanding and implementation of the EEO policy and program including the anti-retaliation provision set forth in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.101(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the agency is required to take appropriate disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory practices, including retaliatory practices. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(6). <span class="Italic">See</span> "Section-by-Section Analysis," 29 CFR Part 1614, 57 Federal Register 12634, 12642 (1992) (whenever any regulation in Part 1614 speaks of a discrimination complaint, the reference should be read to include a retaliation complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hostile Work Environment Claim</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision described the appellant's complaint as raising several allegations of discrimination based on sex and age. However, it is clear from the wording of the attachment to the appellant's complaint and the description of the appellant's allegations contained in the EEO Counselor's Report, that the appellant is alleging that she has been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex and age and in retaliation for her EEO activities. Therefore, as in the <span class="Italic">Cobb</span> case cited above, the agency should have treated the appellant's multiple allegations as examples of the on-going hostile work environment to which the appellant allegedly was being subjected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand the agency should consolidate the instant case for investigation with any other pending complaints filed by the appellant that contain allegations relevant to her hostile work environment claim. <span class="Italic">See Cobb, supra</span>. Such consolidation would conserve limited administrative resources and also facilitate identification and elimination of discriminatory practices. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">As a result of the <span class="Italic">Boyd</span> decision, it was clear that <span class="Italic">per se</span> violations still existed. What remained unclear was whether there was an element of intent that had to be proved. Unfortunately, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Boyd</span> was sidetracked from reaching that issue because the complaint had not been investigated and, therefore, it was unclear if the allegations were true, and were part of a larger pattern of purported conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Pruette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951567 (1998), the Commission, once again, invoked the <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation doctrine in finding that an EEO counselor had attempted to dissuade the employee from pursuing a complaint. In finding a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation, the Commission cited <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, with approval.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1548"></span>In <span class="Italic">Determan v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01961521 (1998), the Commission finally made clear that a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation does not require a finding of intent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next find that the AJ's conclusion that the agency committed a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> violation of Title VII is not supported by the record. Recent Commission decisions demonstrate that statements made by individuals in a supervisory or managerial position, or by individuals who have responsibility for compliance with EEO laws and regulations, were found to have unlawfully interfered with, or by their statements, had a chilling effect on, an employee's potential utilization of the EEO process....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While intent to dissuade was found in many of these cases, a finding of intent has not always been necessary, and we have also concluded that unintentional statements may have a chilling effect on one's decision to utilize the EEO process.... The facts, here, however, do not demonstrate that S1's statements, either intended to, or actually had, a chilling effect on this appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that appellant approached S1 on February 9, 1993, about her desire to pursue a claim based on her nonselection. S1 and appellant had a good working relationship at that time, and they engaged in a lengthy conversation about the pros and cons of filing such a charge. During this discussion, along with S1's description of the potential impact such a claim may have in the workplace, he also encouraged appellant to file a complaint if she believed that discriminatory animus motivated the selection decision. In appellant's affidavit, she stated: "I believe [S1] made this statement [I would make a lot of enemies if I did file a complaint] because he was a friend and bowling companion of both [the selectee and one of the individuals on the selection panel]." In S1's affidavit, he stated that co-workers may be upset when they found out about her EEO activity. S1 did not indicate that management, or anyone who would be in a position to impact her terms and conditions of employment, would be upset if she filed an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, it is relevant here that the selection decision appellant believed was biased was not made by S1 or any individual in her chain of command.... It is also noteworthy that since their conversation, appellant has filed several charges of discrimination, and S1's statements clearly did not chill her desire to pursue her EEO rights. Here, an open and candid communication took place between a supervisor and his employee, a potential EEO claimant, and unlike our previous decisions, there is no showing that S1 either intended to dissuade appellant, or that the statements, irrespective of intent, had the effect of chilling her EEO rights.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61619 (2006) (supervisor's statements to the effect that "some of you have stuck up for each other who have filed, and that's good, but what you guys have done here goes both ways, and I want you to know, that what comes around, goes around" could be <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Eason v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A40247 (2005), finding a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation based on a finding that the supervisor's actions "could only have been intended to intimidate complainant and to cause him to withdraw from the EEO process."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120082983 (2010), the Commission found that a supervisor had engaged in restraint and interference with the EEO process where he required the complainant to channel all EEO counselor contact through him and then questioned the complainant when he independently contacted a counselor. The Commission rejected the supervisor's argument that he needed to schedule all counselor contact in order to save time and have work assignments completed. The Commission also distinguished the <span class="Italic">Smith</span> case from an earlier case where it had found no restraint or interference when a supervisor arranged for the complainant to meet with a counselor. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee may suffer unlawful retaliation if his supervisor interferes with his EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See Binseel v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970584 (October 8, 1998);<span class="Italic"> see also Marr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941344 (June 27, 1996); <span class="Italic">Whidbee v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120040193 (March 31, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, complainant alleged that when he told S that he had an appointment to meet with the EEO counselor, S stated that he would make the appointments for complainant to see an EEO counselor. He stated that S told the EEO counselor, "[Complainant] has a lot of work to do. You've got to come to the shop [to meet with complainant]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further stated that his previous supervisor allowed him to take official time to go and meet with the EEO counselor, and he informed the EEO counselor that S would not allow him to go offsite to meet with the counselor. He stated that after he told the counselor that he was uncomfortable with S arranging his meetings with the counselor at the work facility, the counselor gave complainant "an official signed paper" that he hoped would persuade S to let complainant go offsite to meet with the counselor. Complainant stated that when he presented the paper to S, S stated, "Oh, you've been to [the Naval Station EEO] office in Norfolk." Complainant stated that when he denied going to the Norfolk Naval Station EEO office, S said, "Yes you have. You've been off--this is proof you've been to Norfolk. I'm going to have to dock your pay, AWOL. You have to--you went there without my permission."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, complainant stated that S asked to see his cellular phone, and stated, "Let me see your phone, you know. I can prove that you called that person [EEO counselor], right, went to Norfolk. That's how you got this paper right here." Complainant stated that he did not allow S to check his cellular phone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S stated that after complainant told him that he had met with an EEO counselor, he told complainant, "[Complainant], instead of, you know, going to Norfolk and wasting all that travel time, to let me know, I'll make the appointment for you and bring the guy down here." stated that he did not want the "extra time" it took for complainant to travel to the offsite EEO office to affect the work that needed to be done.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S further stated that he made several appointments for complainant to meet with the EEO counselor in the general foreman's office "behind a locked door." "And as soon as he [complainant] made me aware that he needed an appointment, I set it up at [the EEO counselor's] earliest convenience." S maintained that the agency's policy is for supervisors to set up EEO appointments with employees who want to meet with a counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, S stated that when he saw that complainant had paperwork from an EEO counselor, he asked him where he obtained the paperwork, and complainant denied that he had been to the counselor. He further stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I said, you know, "Have you gone on any EEO business? He said, "No." I said, "Have you been calling the EEO?" I said, "Well, you are going to have to let me see your cell phone to see if you have." He said, "No." And I let it go.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S further stated that complainant asserted that he had the right to see an EEO counselor whenever he wanted to see the counselor. S stated that he told complainant that although he had the right to see an EEO counselor, he must set up the appointment to see the counselor for complainant during work time. He stated that he told complainant that if he left work without permission, his pay would be docked because he would be AWOL. S stated that he did not dock complainant's pay for attempting to meet with an EEO counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this matter, we find that S's acknowledged actions violated the letter and spirit of EEO Regulations and constitute a <span class="Italic">per se</span> interference with the EEO process. By requiring complainant to inform him anytime complainant needed to meet with an EEO counselor, S impermissibly injected himself into the EEO process. Although S maintained that he needed to schedule employees' appointments with EEO counselors to ensure that work time was maximized and travel time to the offsite EEO office was limited, we are persuaded that S required complainant to always go through him before contacting an EEO counselor. For instance, when complainant produced documents from the EEO office, S interrogated complainant about his past EEO activity and asked to inspect his cellular phone so that he could determine if complainant had contacted an EEO counselor without his knowledge. Moreover, S maintained that the agency's policy is for supervisors to schedule all appointments with EEO counselors for employees. S clearly acted as if he were entitled to arrange all of complainant's interactions with an EEO counselor. Thus, we conclude that S's actions went far beyond a legitimate need to verify complainant's whereabouts during work hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that we have held that there may be special, limited circumstances wherein supervisors may permissibly make alternative arrangements for employees to meet with EEO counselors. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Fermin Salas v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120065120 (June 26, 2009), the Commission held that a supervisor did not interfere in the EEO process when he informed an employee that he must attend training critical to his position but would be provided with access to an EEO counselor during the time period that he completed the training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike in <span class="Italic">Salas</span>, there were no special circumstances here that made it necessary for S to arrange all of complainant's meetings with the EEO counselor in perpetuity. In this case, S established himself as the permanent gatekeeper by which employees must pass before they contact an EEO counselor, which undermined complainant's right to consult a counselor anonymously. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(g). S further entangled himself into complainant's EEO activity when he aggressively interrogated complainant about his past contact with an EEO official and attempted to inspect his cellular phone to determine if complainant had contacted the EEO counselor without his knowledge. This excessive entanglement with employees' EEO activity is reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See John B. Whidbee v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No, 0120040193 (March 31, 2005) (Commission found reprisal when supervisor informed all employees that if they wanted to file an EEO complaint, they needed to discuss it with him first); <span class="Italic">see also Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.</span>, 117 S. Ct. 843, 848 (1997) (a primary purpose of anti-retaliation provisions is maintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms). Thus, we conclude that S <span id="Page_1549"></span>unlawfully retaliated against complainant by interfering with his EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120090596 (2011), the Commission found retaliation based on interference with the process where a supervisor told the complainant it would not be in his best interest to file a complaint even where the supervisor testified it was not his intent to discourage the complainant from filing and pursuing a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee may suffer unlawful retaliation if his supervisor interferes with his EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Binseel v. Dep't of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970584 (Oct. 8, 1998); <span class="Italic">see also Marr v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01941344 (June 27, 1996); <span class="Italic">Whidbee v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120040193 (Mar. 31, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, S2 testified that he told Complainant that it would not be in Complainant's best interest to file an EEO complaint. HT, p. 328. S2 further testified the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Well I asked [Complainant], I said [Complainant], I understand you are going to file an EEO complaint. And I said, well, I don't think it would be in your best interest. I'm not trying to discourage him, I'm telling him that he's got to work with these guys on the floor.... Co-workers have come to me and said, "I don't want to work with the guy." I don't trust him. There's a division in that control room right now. How to cure it, I don't know. I even brought that up to [Complainant] last week, and his response was, "well, when this is all settled, done, and over with, you'll see it wasn't about what you think it is, [S2]." He said we can bring this to an end, and I said it's not "we." I wasn't the one that created the racial strife in there, [Complainant] himself has.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this matter, we find that S2's acknowledged actions violated the letter and spirit of EEO regulations and constitute an impermissible <span class="Italic">per se</span> interference with the EEO process. By approaching Complainant and stating that he did not think it would be in Complainant's best interest to file an EEO complaint, S2 improperly injected himself into the EEO process. Moreover, we construe S2's comments as a flagrant attempt to dissuade Complainant from engaging in the EEO process by suggesting or threatening that he could suffer unpleasant consequences if he pursued his EEO claims. Furthermore, S2 compounded his interference with Complainant's EEO activity by telling Complainant that his EEO activity impaired his relationship with co-workers, was divisive, and created racial strife in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the AJ's finding, it does not matter that Complainant continued to pursue his EEO claims despite S2's interference. The Commission has found that even if a complainant successfully initiates the EEO process in spite of such interference, the complainant is still aggrieved. <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dep't of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955276 (Oct. 10, 1997) ("[t]he mere fact that the appellant filed the instant formal complaint does not defeat her claim of unlawful interference with the EEO process.") We find that S2's comments clearly are reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in EEO activity, and as such, violate EEO regulations. <span class="Italic">See Kirk E. Webster v. Dep't of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120080665 (Nov. 4, 2009) (comments made by complainant's supervisor that the EEO complaints complainant filed stressed him out and that in his 20 years at the agency no one had done anything like what complainant had done to him constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII since such comments are likely to have a chilling effect and deter employees from full exercise of their EEO rights).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tanks v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093549 (2011), the Commission found a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where a postmaster held a "stand up" talk after receiving the results of an inspector general investigation that concluded it could not be determined if the postmaster had sexually harassed an employee. The postmaster gave the talk the day after receiving the investigation report. Although there were somewhat different versions of what the postmaster specifically said, all witnesses agreed that he talked about the effect the allegations had on his marriage of 30 years and had nearly caused his daughter to drop out of medical school. Most witnesses also agreed that the postmaster had made comments to the effect that he knew the employees who had made statements to the inspector general and he would remember who those employees were. The Commission also noted that although the postmaster originally denied making the statements about knowing who the employees were and remembering them, on cross-examination he changed his testimony to indicate that he could not remember making the statements.</p>
