<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-80"><span class="space">1.</span> Partial Compliance--Return to<span class="Bold"><span class="Italic"> Status Quo Ante</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Some of the more complex problems arise in settlement agreements where the complainant receives several benefits in exchange for withdrawing his or her complaint. The question becomes what to do when the agency already conferred some of those benefits upon the complainant at the time of the breach. When a complainant seeks reinstatement of his complaint as a remedy for breach under such circumstances, he must return the agency to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in order to have his complaint reinstated. In <span class="Italic">Lyons v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01976838 (1998), the Commission found that the agency breached its settlement agreement with the complainant. However, before specifically ordering a remedy the Commission urged the complainant in <span class="Italic">Lyons</span> to consider the ramifications of his options:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a breach is found, as the case herein, the remedial relief is either the reinstatement of the complaint for further processing or specific enforcement of the settlement agreement. If an appellant's complaint is reinstated for further processing, then the parties must be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> at the time that the parties entered into the settlement agreement, which requires that an appellant return any benefits received pursuant to the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Armour v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965593 (June 24, 1997); <span class="Italic">Komiskey v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955696 (Sept. 5, 1996). In the present case, appellant repeatedly requested that his complaint be reinstated for further processing. Consequently, on REMAND, appellant shall be advised that in order to reinstate his complaint, a condition precedent is the return of any benefits received through the execution of the other provisions of the agreement. In view of this requirement, we therefore give appellant the option, in accordance with the ORDER below, of either returning the benefits conferred pursuant to the agreement and reinstating the complaint, or keeping the benefits conferred pursuant to the agreement and having the agreement specifically enforced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Standifer v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A20757 (2002), where the agency failed to provide the complainant with priority consideration as specified in the settlement agreement, the Commission remanded the case to give the complainant the option of specific enforcement or reinstatement of her complaint after returning other benefits conferred under the agreement. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A10531 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, when the parties have already performed several terms of the settlement agreement, specific enforcement rather than reinstatement of the complaint is the appropriate remedy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rawlings v. Attorney General</span>, 05910554 (1991). There is, however, an exception to this rule. The Commission has held that reinstatement of the complaint as a remedy for breach of a settlement agreement, where both parties already have executed some of the agreement's provisions, can be accomplished if both parties are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. This includes the agency. In <span class="Italic">O'Farrell v. Postmaster General</span>, 04920001 (1992), the complainant resolved her termination by agreeing to a cash settlement award, reinstatement, expungement of the record, and a voluntary resignation. Thereafter, the Commission found the agency in breach of several portions of the settlement agreement. In addressing the complainant's request that her complaint be reinstated as a remedy, the Commission in <span class="Italic">O'Farrell</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that in order for petitioner to reinstate her complaint and the parties return to the point processing ceased, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, petitioner must return the money received pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement. Courts addressing the analogous issue involving ratification of a release have held that: "A party cannot be permitted to retain the benefits received under a contract and at the same time escape the obligations imposed by the contract.... If a releasor, therefore, retains the consideration after learning that the release is voidable, her continued retention of the benefits constitutes a ratification of the release." (Citations omitted). <span class="Italic">Grillet v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 927 F.2d 217 (5th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Haslach v. Security Pacific Bank Oregon</span>, 57 FEP Cases 702 (D. Or. 1991) ("this retention of the benefit is sufficient to amount to a ratification of the release agreement").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Commission finds that petitioner is required to return the money received as a result of entering into the settlement agreement as a prerequisite to having the agency reinstate her prior EEO complaint. Consequently, if petitioner wishes to reinstate her complaint, she is required, within 30 days of receipt of this decision, to make arrangements with the agency for repayment of the monies she has already received. If petitioner remains in possession of the money received under the settlement agreement, such action will be evidence of her intention to abide by the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the Commission noted that if the complainant elected not to return the money, the agency was obligated to discharge the remainder of its obligations under the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120131820 (2015), where the agency agreed to pay the complainant $437,000 and issue a 1099 to the IRS for that amount. The agency paid the complainant, but issued a 1099 to IRS for $600,000. The agency had also paid the complainant's attorney $163,000. The Commission found that the agency was in breach of the agreement and that the complainant had the option of choosing specific performance--i.e., having the agency issue a corrected 1099 to the IRS in the amount of $437,000--or having his complaint reinstated. Of course, the Commission noted that if the complainant chose the latter, he would have to return the money to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any significant analysis in <span class="Italic">Armour v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01965593 (1997), the Commission ordered the complainant to return any benefits obtained under the settlement agreement if he wished to reinstate his complaint. In that case, the Commission found the complainant and the agency made a mutual mistake of fact in entering into one of the key provisions of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01972651 (1998) (requiring complainant to return all monies received under the agreement in order to elect reinstatement of the complaint); <span class="Italic">Komiskey v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01955696 (1996) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the parties agree to reinstatement in the event of breach, then reinstatement is the remedy that should be granted, if possible. In <span class="Italic">Florio v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A04663 (2001), a settlement agreement was entered into in the presence of an administrative judge and transcribed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Florio</span> found that the parties agreed to reinstatement based on the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, review of the hearing transcript memorializing the terms of the settlement agreement at issue confirms that the parties agreed that complainant could reinstate her complaint if she did not obtain a permanent position in six months. At p. 12 of this transcript, the AJ stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As a final element of the agreement, I guess would be that [complainant] agrees to withdraw without prejudice her complaint at this time, subject to reinstatement only as provided for in this agreement or, of course, as provided by the Commission's regulation, if there's a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that complainant's May 12, 2000 letter requests that "reparations" be made soon or that the complaint be reinstated; and, that the agency's September 8, 2000 response concedes that reinstatement is appropriate under the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as there are cases where specific enforcement is not a viable remedy, there are cases where specific enforcement is the only remedy because the parties cannot be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. For example, in <span class="Italic">Volkmar v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01986664 (2001), the settlement agreement provided that the complainant be placed in a GS-12 Module Manager position, or its "functional equivalent." The agency argued that the position was "abolished" because it was upgraded to a GS-13. The Commission looked at the position descriptions to determine if the upgraded position was the functional equivalent of the position in the settlement agreement, despite the difference in grade between the two positions. Of significance to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Volkmar</span> was the fact that the agency knew the position would be upgraded at the time it entered into the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects, however, that the "newly created" GS-13 position is otherwise the same position referenced in the provision. Furthermore, we note that prior to the execution of the subject agreement, complainant's position as Assistant Module Manager was upgraded to the GS-12 level, suggesting that the upgrade of the Module Manager's position was anticipated at that time. Based on the plain meaning of this provision, the Commission determines that the September 1995 GS-13 Module Manager positions are the "functional equivalents" of the pre-September 1995 GS-12 Module Manager positions referenced in the provision. We are unpersuaded by the agency's argument that the term "reassignment" denotes only a transfer to a position of the same grade. The agency <span id="Page_401"></span>provides no authority for this interpretation. To the extent that the agency interpreted the provision in this manner, such an interpretation should have been reduced to writing as part of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Jenkins-Nye v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01851903 (March 4, 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because some of the provisions of the agreement had been fulfilled, the Commission ordered specific enforcement of the provision at issue. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Volkmar</span> found that placement of the complainant in a temporary position did not fulfill the agency's obligations, and, crediting the complainant's testimony about the availability of positions, ordered the agency to place the complainant in a permanent GS-13 Module Manager position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency argues that no permanent Module Manager positions have become available since the time the settlement agreement was executed, and did not anticipate that any would ever become available because of the mandate to downsize its management staff. Therefore, in an effort to satisfy this provision, complainant was offered a GS-13 Module Manager position as a temporary assignment. [August 3, 1998 settlement attempt and draft amendment to settlement agreement] Complainant consistently disputes the agency's claim regarding the lack of suitable vacancies, contending instead that at least two permanent Module Manager vacancies were filled in 1997, by others instead of being offered to her. In her March 25, 1998 letter to the "Fraud Hotline," complainant more specifically contends that the agency created three permanent Module Manager vacancies in 1997. The agency told complainant not to apply for these positions because she would be awarded one under the terms of the settlement agreement. Instead, however, complainant contends that two of the vacancies were filled as permanent positions, but complainant was offered only a temporary assignment under the third "vacancy." Therefore, not only was she denied the promised vacancy as a permanent position, but she was also precluded from the opportunity to apply for these vacancies along with the other candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the agency's claim to the contrary, we find that complainant's statements in the March 25, 1998 letter to the "Fraud Hotline," as set forth above, to be detailed and credible. Moreover, we note that the agency has submitted no documentary evidence to challenge this account. Accordingly, we find that by failing to place complainant in one of the Module Manager vacancies which occurred in 1997, as a permanent position, the agency breached the provision of the settlement agreement at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission exercises its discretion and orders the agency to specifically comply with the settlement agreement provision at issue, by placing complainant in a permanent GS-13 Module Manager position and to pay attorney's fees and costs incurred by complainant in seeking compliance with this term of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A promise to return the agency to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is not sufficient. The complainant must actually return the agency to that point in order to have his complaint reinstated. In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 04A30002 (2003), the complainant received over $100,000 in benefits settlement agreement that provided for his retirement. The agreement included a clause which the Commission held was void. The Commission gave the complainant the option of having agreement specifically enforced without the offending clause or reinstatement of his complaints upon return of the agency to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The complainant elected reinstatement of his complaints and tendered the agency a payment of $100 as a deposit indicating he would repay the rest after he was reinstated. The Commission rejected the complainant's "self-designated repayment plan" because it did not return the agency to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The Commission gave the complainant one last opportunity to either repay the $100,000-plus to the agency or have the agreement specifically enforced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the agency has committed to performance in a settlement agreement, it may not later argue that the provision is moot. Even though the complainant in <span class="Italic">Shedd v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01995189 (2000), retired before a provision in the agreement was performed, the Commission found that the complainant's breach allegation was not moot. The provision at issue concerned an evaluation the agency had agreed to do. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Shedd</span> ordered specific enforcement, noting that the complainant had already left the agency when the agreement was signed, but he deemed the evaluation provision critical nonetheless:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determines that a reasonable construction of provision 3 placed an affirmative obligation upon the agency to complete a Personnel Management Evaluation in FY 1995. The agency acknowledges that it did not complete an evaluation and argues that because of changed circumstances, it is unable to comply with provision 3. We are not persuaded, however, by the agency's argument that complainant's departure from the agency released it from its duty. According to complainant, he had already left the agency at the time the agreement was entered. Although, as noted above, provision 3 required the agency to complete the evaluation during Fiscal Year 1995, the Commission determines that the agency can still implement the evaluation albeit subsequent to the expiration of the fiscal year identified in the agreement. Noting complainant's assertion that the independent evaluation was a "crucial aspect" of the agreement, we order specific performance of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Newbold v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962371 (1997), the Commission raised, without deciding, the issue of whether a complainant's attorney could be ordered to return an attorney's fee award in order to reinstate a complaint. In that case, the Commission found the agency was in breach of the settlement agreement but noted the complainant had not requested reinstatement of the complaint. Instead, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Newbold</span> sought specific performance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency further informs the Commission on appeal that the appellant has not offered to return the amount paid to him for attorney's fees. The Commission observes that the agency did not reimburse the appellant $2500 for his attorney's fee expenses. Instead, it agreed to, and apparently did, pay a lump sum of $2500 in attorney's fees to the appellant's attorney, a signatory to the agreement. Whether either the appellant or his attorney would be required to repay the agency $2500 in attorney's fees would become an issue only if the appellant were requesting that his complaint be reinstated to remedy the agency's noncompliance. However, in the instant case, the appellant has requested specific performance, not reinstatement of his complaint. Accordingly, the Commission orders the agency to comply with provision 5 of the agreement as authorized by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant indicates on appeal that if the agency does not intend to fully comply with the agreement, he believes that the Commission should order the agency to make a job offer to him, including restoration of seniority to the date he was fired, and payment of the personal expenses he incurred in the EEO process and to obtain enforcement of the agreement. The Commission does not have the legal authority to do what the appellant requests. Under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c), if the Commission determines that the agency is not in compliance and the noncompliance is not attributable to acts or conduct of the complainant, the Commission may order such compliance or it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased. Thus, if the agency does not comply with the terms of the agreement on remand, the appellant can request that his complaint be reinstated at the point which processing ceased pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(a). However, as discussed above, this would raise the issue of whether the $2500 in attorney's fees would have to be returned by the appellant or his attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps it is inadvertent, but a disturbing facet of the <span class="Italic">Newbold</span> decision is that it appears to give the agency the final decision between specific performance or complaint reinstatement by noting that if the agency does not comply this would again raise the attorney fees issue. Given that such a result would make little sense, it may well be that the Commission instead meant that if the agency continued to refuse to comply, the complainant would have the option of continuing to seek specific performance or requesting reinstatement of his complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jarmakani v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01964812 (1998), the Commission seemingly resolved the issue of returning attorney fees. The Commission found that attorney fees need not be returned because an agency's subsequent breach of an agreement did not alter the fact that, at the time of settlement, the complainant was the prevailing party. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Jarmakani</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, where we have ordered the reinstatement of a complaint, we have also required the restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante, i.e.</span>, that a complainant does not retain any benefits received under the SA. <span class="Italic">See Corbbrey v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910885 (May 7, 1992); <span class="Italic">O'Farrell v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04920001 (Feb. 28, 1992). Thus, appellant would have to return any monies received under the SA. The only exception to this would be attorney's fees paid by the agency pursuant to the SA, since the agency's subsequent breach of the SA does not alter appellant's status as a prevailing party as of the time he settled the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Dailey v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950225 (July 29, 1996); <span class="Italic">Eaglin v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910604 (Aug. 21, 1991). Therefore, we find that appellant will not be required to return the attorney's fees previously paid by the agency under the SA as a precondition to the reinstatement of his complaint. Moreover, we note that our decisions have also awarded attorney's fees under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.501(e) for the successful pursuit of an appeal alleging a breach of a SA by an agency<span class="Italic">. See Eaglin, supra; Epstein v. Department of Health and Human services</span>, EEOC Appeal No 01952695 (Mar. 11, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, if appellant instead chooses to seek the agency's compliance with the SA, the agency will be obligated to pay any interest on any sums of money the agency delayed sending beyond the promised deadline.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Basu v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01970460 (1999), the Commission extended its holding in <span class="Italic">Jamarkani</span>, finding that an agency could not excuse its own failure to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement by requiring that the complainant return any fees paid under the agreement. Moreover, the Commission found the fees were paid directly to the complainant's attorney <span id="Page_402"></span>and it was not within the complainant's control to return the monies in any event. Given those circumstances, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Basu</span> ordered that the complaint be reinstated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc</span>. 522 U.S. 422, 118 S. Ct. 838 (1998), the Court announced that mere retention of monies does not amount to a ratification of an agreement to waive the employee's ADEA claims. In <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, the defendant attempted to hold the petitioner to the terms of the agreement when she refused to tender back the monies received under the agreement. The Court found for the petitioner, and stated, "...the employer cannot invoke the employee's failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span><span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, in <span class="Italic">Basu,</span> the Commission held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, there is no dispute that the agency failed to honor the terms of the settlement agreement. In fact, the agency admitted to the breach and agreed to reinstate appellant's complaint. Appellant argues that because of the agency's breach she should not be required to return the attorney's fees. In the present case, the Commission agrees that the agency cannot excuse its own admitted breach of the settlement agreement by claiming that appellant's failure to return attorney's fees awarded therein precludes further processing of the complaint. Moreover, we note that the payment was made directly to appellant's attorney, not appellant, for a successfully completed legal representation, at his address, and therefore, appellant had no control of the money once it was paid to her attorney. For these reasons, the Commission finds that return of the fees is not a prerequisite for continued processing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that in the <span class="Italic">Basu</span> case there was no way the Commission could effectively order the agency to comply with the agreement. The agreement called for the complainant to be temporarily promoted to a GS-14 position and to receive priority referral for GS-14 positions. The agency admitted that it breached these provisions of the agreement. It is not clear that the Commission would have ordered reinstatement of the complaint in <span class="Italic">Basu</span> if there had been a way to order specific enforcement of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to <span class="Italic">Jamarkani</span> and <span class="Italic">Basu</span>, in <span class="Italic">America v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01A30721 (2003), the Commission categorically stated that attorney fees awarded as part of a settlement must be refunded to the agency to return it to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. In <span class="Italic">America</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that fees should be severed from the amount of money required to return the parties to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Attorney fees paid for prosecution of a complaint to the point of settlement are not in the category of relief retained by the complainant for his own benefit, and a settlement agreement that fails to preserve the issue of fees and costs will operate as an implicit waiver of fees and costs. EEOC Management Directive 110, Chpt. 11 (IV)(A), at 11-3 (Nov. 11, 1999); <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01962207, <span class="Italic">RTR granted on other grounds</span>, 05990764 (Oct. 12, 2000). Accordingly, the complainant must arrange with the agency for repayment of the full $92,500.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Tuffano v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120061435 (2008), invoking <span class="Italic">Basu</span> in holding that the complainant did not have to repay the agency a $10,000 lump sum under the agreement in order to have his complaint processed upon a finding of breach.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is less than clear what standards the Commission uses to determine if a breach has occurred and which party has the burden of proof. However, in recent years the Commission's Compliance Officers have become more active and routinely require agencies to produce proof of compliance with Commission decisions. In line with this policy, the Commission appears to have implicitly adopted a policy of requiring agencies to produce proof of compliance when confronted with an allegation of breach of an agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sarnowski v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01892384 (1989). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Swirczynski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912778 (1991) (holding the burden is on complainant to prove breach of an agreement and that complainant must sustain that burden through evidence, rather than mere allegation). The most likely resolution of this seeming conflict is that the complainant initially bears the burden of making a nonfrivolous allegation of breach and to present some evidence that a breach has occurred. At that point in time, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no good faith defense to a breach allegation when the language of the agreement is clear and unambiguous. To find in such circumstances that a "breach was excusable because the agency was making good faith efforts to correct its breach undermine[s] the integrity and enforceability of that document." <span class="Italic">O'Farrell v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910518 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a somewhat cryptic decision, the Commission held that it may not award remedies such as "back pay, promotion or increases in salary." <span class="Italic">Metts v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05970935 (1998). In a breach allegation that involved priority consideration, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Metts</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c) provides the only available remedy upon a finding of breach. The provision provides that if the Commission determines that the agency is not in compliance with a settlement agreement and the noncompliance is not attributable to acts or conduct of the complainant, it may order such compliance or it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased. Therefore, the appellant's are not entitled to remedies such as back pay, promotion or increases in salary as requested by A-1 in his August 1995 letter to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Metts</span> ordered specific enforcement of the agreement by giving the complainant priority consideration for future selections.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the language of <span class="Italic">Metts</span> suggests that the Commission cannot order an agency to grant retroactive relief for breach of a settlement agreement, it is more likely the Commission simply found the complainant in <span class="Italic">Metts</span> was not entitled to such relief because he could not establish that he would have been selected had priority consideration been granted. Specific enforcement would be a meaningless remedy if, in appropriate cases, the Commission could not award retroactive relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01996856 (2001), the Commission, relying on <span class="Italic">Metts</span>, held that it could not award retroactive relief despite a finding that the agency failed to grant the complainant priority consideration. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Holloway</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency clearly breached the agreement when complainant was not given priority consideration. In its decision, the agency notes that if complainant elects specific implementation, "he should receive priority consideration for two years from the date of his election." Complainant argues on appeal, however, that he is entitled to placement in the GS-5 position retroactively, which would now be at the GS-6 level under the terms of the announcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under EEOC Regulation, the remedies available for breach of the agreement are specific performance of the agreement or reinstatement of the complainant's underlying complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(a). Complainant cannot obtain the back pay and position he requested on appeal<span class="Italic">. See Metts v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970935 (June 11, 1998) (In breach finding for failure to provide priority consideration, promotion, back pay, and increase in salary not available.) Because complainant's requested remedy is unavailable, as noted above, we find that complainant should be given the opportunity to choose future priority consideration, or reinstatement of his complaint as offered in the agency decision. Further, because complainant was a prevailing party, he is entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Batchelor v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01997215 (2000) (future priority consideration or reinstatement of a complaint are the only remedies for breach involving failure to grant priority consideration). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Batchelor</span> also alleged that the failure to grant priority consideration was an independent act of discrimination as well as a breach. The Commission ordered the agency to allow the complainant 30 days to seek counseling on the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's position here results in cases where there is essentially no remedy for breach. For example, in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072688 (2007), the agency agreed to rescind a removal, expunge the personnel file of the complainant, reinstate her to a part-time flexible position, and restore her oriGINAl seniority date. Seven years later, the complainant discovered the removal had not been expunged from the personnel record. She had applied for, but not received, several promotions during that period. After finding that the agency breached the clear requirements of the agreement by keeping the removal in her personnel file, the Commission held that the complainant could seek reinstatement of her complaint or specific enforcement. However, the Commission reminded the complainant that to elect reinstatement of her complaint, she would have to restore the agency to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, which would include giving back her job. The Commission did not say if she would also be required to return to the agency seven years of pay. As to specific enforcement, though, the only "remedy" offered by the Commission was to have the removal records finally expunged from the personnel file.</p>
<p class="noindent">In some instances, the passage of time required for an enforcement proceeding may require an alteration in the terms of the agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, 05970889 (2000), the Commission altered the terms of the agreement and enforced it in its altered state where the called-for retirement date of the complainant had already passed by the time of the enforcement order.</p>
