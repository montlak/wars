<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-12"><span class="space">2.</span> Formal Meetings</h4>
<p class="noindent">Aside from any representational rights that an employee may have, either as an EEO complainant or as an employee within a collective bargaining unit, the union itself has a statutory right to be present at certain "formal discussions" between any unit employee and representatives of the agency. Pursuant to 5 USC 7114:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)(2) An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Statute makes clear, the right belongs to the union and not the employee or employees involved in the discussion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Along with the union's right to be present, the union also has the right to be notified, in advance, of any such discussions. Without the corresponding right to notification, the union would not be in a position to exercise its right to be present.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing in the plain language of the Statute makes it applicable to the EEO complaint process. However, in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow CA and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1482, AFL-CIO</span>, 52 FLRA No. 107 (1997), the Authority held that an EEO complaint was a "grievance" within the ambit of 7114(a)(2)(A) and that the union had a right to be present at settlement discussions between agency management and a complainant who was within the collective bargaining unit. In so holding, the FLRA rejected the view of the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Fresno Service Center, Fresno, CA v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983), and adopted the view of the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The Authority, in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1023-24, to support its position that section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not apply to any EEOC proceeding, whether at the informal or the formal complaint stage. In <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the Ninth Circuit held that the union's right to representation at formal discussions pursuant to section 7114(a)(2)(A) "do[es] not apply to the EEO precomplaint conciliation conference involved in [that] case." <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1021. The court held that, by the terms of the applicable EEOC regulation, the meeting was "informal" and it noted the confidentiality requirements of EEO complaints at the informal stage<span class="Italic">. <span id="Page_655"></span>Id.</span> at 1023-24. The court further held that the EEO complaint was not a "grievance, "because the regulatory EEOC procedures involved in the case were unrelated to the contractual grievance process<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1024. In support of this conclusion, the court pointed out that the parties' collective bargaining agreement excluded discrimination complaints from its grievance procedure<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1024-25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously fully considered the conflict between this decision and the D.C. Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, which disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's construction of the term "grievance." In <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, the Authority concluded, consistent with the rationale in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, that a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) can encompass a statutory appeal. Accordingly, to the extent that the Respondent is relying on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, we reject such reliance for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Ray Brook. See Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 589-90.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> on three grounds. First, as the Judge found and the Respondent does not dispute, the EEO proceeding here was at the formal complaint stage. Although formal complaint procedures are governed by regulations promulgated by the EEOC, they lack certain features that the <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> court found "critical" in the informal proceedings at issue there. For example, in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the applicable regulations required that an EEO counselor "seek a resolution of the matter on an informal basis" before the formal complaint system could be activated<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1024 (quoting from 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.213(a)). The meeting at issue in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> was convened by the counselor for this purpose. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In contrast, the meeting in this case took place after the filing of a formal complaint and was convened not by an EEO counselor, but by the Respondent's General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the confidentiality concerns associated with the precomplaint proceedings noted by the <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> court are absent here<span class="Italic">. Cf. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Denver, Colorado v. FLRA</span>, 3 F.3d 1386, 1391 (10th Cir. 1993) (court found meeting concerning Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) proceeding to be a formal discussion, distinguishing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> in part by noting the absence of confidentiality concerns). At the precomplaint stage, the EEO counselor is prohibited from revealing the identity of a person consulting him<span class="Italic">. IRS, Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1023 (citing 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.213(a)). In this case the complainant's identity had already been revealed prior to the first meeting attended by Leader, the Respondent and the Union to discuss the settlement of Leader's EEO complaint. The Union was invited and did attend two settlement discussions concerning Leader's EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, it is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> and its progeny to find that the discrimination complaint at issue is a "grievance" for the purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Under Ninth Circuit precedent, an employee complaint processed under a statutory process is not<span class="Italic"> per se</span> excluded under the definition of "grievance" for the purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A)<span class="Italic">. See VA, Long Beach</span>, 16 F.3d at 1533-34 (meeting with bargaining unit employees in preparation for MSPB proceeding concerned a "grievance"). In distinguishing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span> found relevant that there was no indication that the dispute was excluded from the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and therefore, the complaint could have been brought either under the grievance procedure or under the statutory appeal process<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The court concluded that the case concerned a matter intimately connected with the union's collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1534. There is no indication in this case that discrimination complaints are excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Respondent mistakenly relies on dicta in <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span> characterizing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> as holding that "the protections of the Statute [do not] apply to proceedings conducted by EEOC."<span class="Italic"> Id. VA, Long Beach</span> concerned the applicability of section 7114(a)(2)(A) to discussions regarding MSPB proceedings. In distinguishing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span> unnecessarily overstated the prior holding. We find nothing in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> that supports such a broad reading. Rather, the court in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> limited its holding to the specific circumstances of that case, namely that "5 USC &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) does not apply to precomplaint conciliation conferences such as that involved here[.]" 706 F.2d at 1025.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base, Arizona and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1547</span>, 54 FLRA 716, 723-33 (1998), the FLRA extended its holding in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, and found that a mediation session held by an EEO counselor and investigator with a complainant that ended in settlement was a formal discussion within the meaning of the Statute where the agency was represented by an attorney from the Judge Advocate General's office. The Authority found that a formal discussion occurred, even though the counselor and the investigator served as intermediaries and the attorney and the employee never spoke face-to-face. As the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have the right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A), all the elements of that section must exist. There must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment<span class="Italic">. General Services Administration, Region 9 and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 236</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994) (GSA I).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">1.&#x2003;The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Was a Discussion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Respondent engaged in a "discussion" with the employee about her EEO complaints, within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), and, thus, we will not address this requirement. However, the Respondent argues that this discussion was not "formal" and concerned neither a "grievance" within the meaning of the Statute nor a matter affecting other unit employees. The Respondent additionally argues that neither the OCI investigator nor its chief EEO counselor were "representatives of the agency" for purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">2.&#x2003;The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Was Formal</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">GSA I</span>, the Authority held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In determining whether a discussion is formal within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), [the Authority has] advised that the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined, but that a number of factors are relevant: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) how long the discussions lasted; (6) whether a formal agenda was established for the discussions; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">GSA I</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355. These factors are illustrative, and other factors may be identified and applied as appropriate in a particular case<span class="Italic">. See F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 157 (1996) (Warren). Therefore, in determining formality, the Authority considers the totality of the facts and circumstances<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OCI investigator presided at, and the chief EEO counselor facilitated, the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints. The Respondent disputes the Judge's finding that the OCI investigator and the chief EEO counselor were agents of management on January 19. It asserts that the chief EEO counselor is a "neutral." However, the Respondent does not deny that management was represented at all times by an attorney from the Judge Advocate General's office. The Judge Advocate General attorney participated in the initial settlement discussions of January 18 as well as on January 19. In addition, the Judge Advocate General attorney ultimately drafted and signed the agreement with the employee on January 19<span class="Italic">. See</span> Exceptions at 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the concession by the Respondent that management was represented at all times by an attorney from the Judge Advocate General's office, we, therefore, find it unnecessary to address, and do not adopt, the Judge's findings that the OCI investigator and the chief EEO counselor are also "representatives" of the Agency within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Similarly, we do not address the Respondent's contention that the chief EEO counselor is a "neutral." In addition, we do not address the Respondent's contention that the OCI investigator is not a representative of the Agency because of her organizational location.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that since the Judge Advocate General attorney was not the employee's first level supervisor, the mediation session was not attended by an Agency representative of the sort that would indicate a "formal" meeting. Although there is no doubt that she was not the employee's first level supervisor, it is clear that the Judge Advocate General attorney represented a high level of management. The Judge identified the attorney as "the Chief of Civil Law" in the Judge Advocate General's office. Judge's Decision at 2. The attorney identified herself at the hearing as "chief of adverse actions." Transcript at 120.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an attempt to support its contention of "informality," the Respondent describes the back and forth nature of the mediation/investigation session. The record does not show that the Judge Advocate General attorney was physically present at the January 19 mediation/investigation session with the employee, and the Judge made no finding as to that point. The attorney testified that she was never in the room with the employee on that day<span class="Italic">. See</span> Transcript at 125. The employee testified that she remembered that the attorney brought the proposed settlement agreement into the room but "didn't say a word to anybody" and then left<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 76.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the evidence is inconclusive that the employee and the Judge Advocate General attorney ever spoke directly to each other on January 19, they communicated extensively through the chief EEO counselor. The record shows that at that mediation/investigation session, the chief EEO counselor was "in and out of the room" relaying the employee's position regarding a proposed settlement agreement to the Judge Advocate General attorney and returning to present the Respondent's position to the employee<span class="Italic">. See</span> Transcript at 125-26, 130-31, 195-99, 233-35, 260-67. <span id="Page_656"></span>Moreover, this process ultimately produced a settlement agreement signed by the Judge Advocate General attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if they were communicating exclusively through the chief EEO counselor, it is clear that both the employee and the Judge Advocate General attorney were engaged in responding to each other's settlement positions, and that they were no less engaged than if they had been speaking face-to-face--as they had been speaking the previous day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A normal mediation technique is to have people in different rooms with someone going back and forth conducting the negotiation. The Union's interest and right to be represented at face-to-face negotiations of a grievance, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., GSA I</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355-56, applies as well, in our view, to a negotiation conducted through a mediator. Under these circumstances, the Judge Advocate General attorney was effectively present at the January 19 mediation/investigation session. Thus, the nature of the communication during the mediation/investigation session on January 19 does not undermine the overall formality<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach California</span>, 41 FLRA 1370, 1379-80 (1991), (<span class="Italic">VAMC, Long Beach</span>), enforced, 16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994) (an interview conducted by telephone was "formal" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints took place outside of the employee's work area indicates that it was formal. The Judge found that it took place "a mile or more away from [the employee's] work site." Judge's Decision at 10. The Respondent does not dispute this finding, but describes the meeting site as "a neutral location outside of the employee's work area." Exceptions at 5. Meetings held outside an employee's immediate work area are associated with formality, while those held in the work area are not<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 45 FLRA 1332, 1335-36 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>) (shop floor discussion not formal); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Depot Tracy, Tracy, California</span>, 37 FLRA 952 (1990) (meeting held in employee lunchroom formal); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration Field Operations, Region II</span>, 29 FLRA 1205, 1216 (1987) (meeting at supervisor's desk near employee's seat assignment not formal). In view of the fact that the mediation/investigation session was held on the Respondent's premises, it is not clear whether it is properly characterized as having been at a "neutral location," as the Respondent maintains. In any event, even if this location were viewed as "neutral," it does not outweigh the fact that it was an Agency location outside the employee's immediate work area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The length of the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints similarly indicates that it was formal. The Judge found that the January 19 mediation/investigation session culminating in the settlement agreement lasted three hours<span class="Italic">. See</span> Judge's Decision at 10. As the Respondent describes it, "[t]he mediation process lasted over a two day period covering a period of seven and a half hours." Exceptions at 5. The Respondent presents no basis, and none is apparent given all the other evidence in the case, for describing a three hour mediation/investigation session--much less a seven and one half hour session extending over two days--as impromptu or spontaneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that an agenda was established for the January 18 and January 19 mediation/investigation sessions of the EEO complaints. The Judge found that "there clearly was a pre-established agenda for the meeting." Judge's Decision at 10. The Respondent asserts that "there was no formal agenda for the informal mediation session." Exceptions at 3, 5. The Authority has relied on a variety of evidence to conclude that a particular meeting had or did not have an "agenda." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 159 (message received by one military command from another found to be agenda for formal discussion); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 45 FLRA at 1336 (no agenda where supervisor "thought through his plans for the meeting," but did so only five or ten minutes in advance); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C. and VA Medical Center, Brockton Division, Brockton, Massachusetts</span>, 37 FLRA 747, 754 (1990) (agenda found where supervisor distributed old and new shift schedules and asked employees to choose new shifts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge does not say precisely what he found to be the "agenda" in this case, the record shows that the OCI investigator sent the employee a memorandum some two weeks prior to the mediation/investigation session. This memorandum referred to the issues in the employee's complaints, explained the general plan of the meeting, and laid out certain ground rules<span class="Italic">. See</span> General Counsel Exhibit 2. The investigator sent a copy of this memorandum to the Respondent's chief EEO counselor<span class="Italic">. See</span> Respondent Exhibit 12. To the extent that the OCI investigator's memorandum shows that the mediation/investigation session to discuss the employee's EEO complaints was planned in advance and had a set of clearly-defined objectives and procedures that were communicated to all the participants, we find that this memorandum was an "agenda" for the mediation/investigation session.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the employee's attendance may not have been mandatory in the sense that she could face discipline for refusing to meet with the OCI investigator, the evidence shows that she had reasonable grounds to conclude that her complaints could be adversely affected if she did not attend. The Judge found that the employee "considered the meeting to be mandatory." Judge's Decision at 4, 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that "[t]he meeting was conducted by mutual consent[,]" presumably meaning that it was voluntary. Exceptions at 5. The OCI investigator testified that the employee's attendance was "not mandatory" and that she had never heard of a complainant being disciplined for refusing to speak with an OCI investigator. Transcript at 168-69. However, the OCI investigator's memorandum to the employee, discussed above, states that "[f]ailure to cooperate in the investigation. . .will not stop the investigation. It will, however, result in recommendations based on available information and may be the basis for an adverse inference concerning the position of the nonresponding party." General Counsel Exhibit 2 at 2. Based on this, we find that attendance by the employee at the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was, in effect, mandatory. Nevertheless, even if attendance were not mandatory, the other indicia of formality support our conclusion that the session on January 19 was a formal discussion<span class="Italic">. See, Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 159.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that "the meeting resulted in a signed settlement agreement[,] reflecting the results of the meeting." Judge's Decision at 10. The Respondent asserts merely that "no notes [were] taken." Exceptions at 5. The record does not indicate that anyone took notes or minutes during the actual settlement on January 19, but it is unclear whether notes or minutes would have been expected. In her memorandum to the employee, the OCI investigator stated that "[t]he entire mediation conference is confidential, except for information which I would be required to report by law[,]" and "[a]side from minimal notes and the actual [settlement] agreement, if any, no report or testimony unique to the mediation conference will be included in the discrimination complaint file." General Counsel Exhibit 2 at 2. To the extent that the initial focus of the January 19 mediation/investigation session had shifted from mediation to investigation, however, the record shows that the OCI investigator was in the process of transcribing the employee's statement into her computer when the Respondent presented its settlement offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, and considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, we are persuaded that the evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was a "formal discussion" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., GSA I</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355-56 (settlement negotiations of an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board between an agency and the employee and her private attorney constituted formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 16 FLRA at 1033-34, is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority adopted a Judge's conclusion that meetings to settle an EEO complaint were not formal. In that case, the Judge viewed as dispositive that the presiding official was a facilitator, attendance was not mandatory, and the manner of the discussion was not confrontational. As explained above, for the purpose of determining whether the discussion was formal, we view the January 19th session as, in effect, mandatory. In any event, to the extent that <span class="Italic">SSA</span> implies that a facilitated discussion in general, or a mediated negotiation in particular, can never be "formal" under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, we reject that conclusion. In our view, a union's statutory right to notice and an opportunity to be present during a discussion is not diminished when the discussion between employees and agency representatives is conducted in a nonconfrontational manner through a neutral third party<span class="Italic">. SSA</span> will no longer be followed to the extent it implies that a discussion conducted in this way will never be found "formal" within the meaning of the Statute. We will continue to look at the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a discussion is formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's reliance on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> to support its position that meetings may be found informal when the "regulatory framework" of the EEOC characterizes them that way. Exceptions at 6. The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 52 FLRA 1039 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Barstow</span>) issued after the Judge's decision in this case. In <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, the Authority concluded that a meeting, at which management presented an employee with a proposed settlement agreement of a formal EEO complaint, was a formal discussion of a grievance that the union should have been permitted to attend. In reaching this conclusion, the Authority pointed to its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution (Ray Brook, New York)</span>, 29 FLRA 584, 589-90 (1987), <span class="Italic">affirmed sub nom. American Federation of Government Employees Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>). In <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, the Authority decided to follow the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> over that of the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> and held that a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) can encompass a statutory appeal. For the reasons stated in <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, we reject the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_657"></span>3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Was Between a Representative of the Agency and a Unit Employee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the Respondent concedes that the attorney from the Judge Advocate General's Office was its representative and had settlement authority for purposes of this case. Exceptions at 5. The Respondent asserts that the Judge Advocate General attorney was not a supervisor of the employee. However, nothing in section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute requires that a "representative" be a supervisor<span class="Italic">. Cf. VAMC, Long Beach. California</span>, 41 FLRA at 1379 (undisputed that respondent's attorney who conducted telephone interview was respondent's representative); and <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 39 FLRA 298, 311-12 (1991) (finding respondent "responsible for the acts and conduct of its agent, regardless of the organizational location of its agent"). Thus, we conclude that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was between a "representative" of the Agency and a unit employee within the meaning of section 7114(a) (2) (A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">4.&#x2003;The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Concerned a Grievance</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge correctly concluded that the formal EEO complaints filed by the employee constituted a "grievance" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A)<span class="Italic">. See Barstow</span>, 52 FLRA at 1045-46. We reject the Respondent's assertion that section 7114(a)(2)(A) cannot recognize as a "grievance" any matter that the parties have excluded from their own negotiated grievance procedure. The statutory definition of a grievance is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. Agencies and unions remain free to exclude from their grievance procedures any matters they choose. This does not preclude matters they exclude from their grievance procedures from being "grievances" under the Statute if they otherwise meet the elements of section 7103(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's argument that the Union had no right to be present at the "mediation" in this case because that mediation affected only the employee herself, not the bargaining unit as a whole, is also misplaced. Exceptions at 9. Section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not require that a "grievance" manifest some effect on other employees in the bargaining unit before it may become the subject of a formal discussion<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Barstow</span>, 52 FLRA at 1045-46; <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina</span>, 32 FLRA 222, 230 (1988) ("[S]ection 7114(a)(2)(A) requires that a formal discussion be connected with a grievance of a bargaining unit employee or with any personnel policy or practices or other general conditions of employment affecting bargaining unit employees."). The Authority's determinations under section 7114(a)(2)(A) are "guided by that section's intent and purpose--to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit--viewed in the context of a union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 589.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we conclude that the grievance did affect the bargaining unit as a whole. This conclusion is supported by testimony from the employee and from the Respondent's own witnesses about the employee's concern that she not be placed in a job for which other employees may have been competing<span class="Italic">. See, e.g</span>., Transcript at 205-06, 232, 237. The Respondent concedes that the employee herself insisted on modifying the proposed settlement agreement to provide that it would have no "impact" on other bargaining unit positions<span class="Italic">. See</span> Exceptions at 12. The Respondent consented to this modification and created a new position for the employee. Its present argument that the settlement discussions had no effect on other unit employees because the discussions resulted in an agreement that other employees would not be affected is without merit. For example, the allocation of a position to the employee would necessarily deprive other employees from bidding on that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;The Presence of a Union Representative at the January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Would Not Conflict With EEOC Regulations or the ADR Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">EEOC regulations</span>. As the General Counsel points out, the Respondent does not contend that 29 CFR Part 1614 and EEO MD 110 actually prohibit the presence of a union representative at the formal discussion of an employee's EEO complaint. Rather, the Respondent asserts only that those regulations do not provide for the union's presence: "[n]in 29 CFR Part 1614 does that regulation allow for the exclusive representative's presence, unless the exclusive representative is the complainant's designated representative." Exceptions at 9. The fact that 29 CFR Part 1614 does not mention the right of a union to be present at a formal discussion of an EEO complaint does not mean that the union's presence is forbidden or that that regulation necessarily conflicts with the protections of the Statute<span class="Italic">. Cf. Barstow</span>, 52 FLRA at 1046. Indeed, the Respondent points to no such conflict in this case. The Respondent does assert that the Authority is not "entitled to deference in interpreting the law involving the processing of individual EEO complaints." Exceptions at 10. However, in the absence of any apparent inconsistency between section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute and "the law involving the processing of individual EEO complaints[,]" nothing in this case requires the Authority to make such an interpretation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Further, because we find no conflict between the EEOC regulations and the Statute, it is not necessary to determine whether those regulations would trump the Statute in general, or section 7114(a)(2)(A) in particular.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also relies on <span class="Italic">dictum</span> by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189, that Congress has explicitly decided that a conflict between the rights of identifiable victims of discrimination and the interests of the bargaining unit must be resolved in favor of the former. Again, however, the Respondent identifies no conflict between the rights of the employee in this case and those of the Union or the rest of the bargaining unit. In particular, it does not dispute the Judge's finding that the employee not only never objected to the Union president's presence at the settlement discussions but, "[o]n the contrary, she had wanted him to be present." Judge's Decision at 5, n.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">2.&#x2003;Administrative Dispute Resolution Act</span>. Section 574 of the ADR Act, titled "Confidentiality," deals with circumstances under which certain communications made during dispute resolution proceedings may not be disclosed by the parties or by the neutral outside those proceedings. An exclusive representative that is a "party" to the proceedings would presumably be bound by the nondisclosure provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 574. The focus of section 574 of the ADR Act is on the protection of the confidentiality of alternate dispute resolution proceedings and not on who may attend such proceedings. Thus, the mere presence of a union representative at a dispute resolution proceeding where all the elements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) were met, in and of itself, would not conflict with those provisions of the ADR Act. Further, because we find no conflict between the ADR Act and the Statute, we need not determine whether the ADR Act, if applicable, would trump the Statute in general, or section 7114(a)(2)(A) in particular.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reliance on such cases as <span class="Italic">TRACON</span>, 51 FLRA 115, in which the Authority found that the Privacy Act precluded the disclosure of an EEO settlement agreement, is misplaced. In contrast to those cases, the Union here has not requested any information and the Respondent has not been charged with refusing to provide any. Further, the fact that section 7114(b)(4) may not require an agency to disclose an EEO settlement agreement to a union does not mean that a union has no right under section 7114(a)(2)(A) to attend the formal discussion of an EEO complaint, whether that discussion results in a settlement agreement or not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that either EEOC regulations or the ADR Act conflicts with section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute or otherwise precludes the Union's right to be represented at the discussion in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an unpublished opinion, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the FLRA in <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, 208 F.3d 221 (9th Cir. 1999) (Table). In the memorandum of decision, the court noted that the collective bargaining agreement in question excluded allegations of discrimination and concluded that the EEO complaint was not a grievance within the meaning of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The result of the FLRA decisions and the decisions of the Ninth Circuit and D.C. Circuit, combined with the silence of the EEOC, is that the rules surrounding union representation in the EEO process remain unsettled. However, agency representatives need to be aware that there is some danger of finding an unfair labor practice if they exclude a union from certain portions of the EEO process. Nor should it be assumed that all complainants will be in favor of the union participating. When the union attempts to participate in the EEO process through 7114(a)(2)(A), it represents the interests of the union and not the individual complainant. Those interests may or may not be perfectly aligned with those of the complainant.</p>
