<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-87"><span class="space">9.</span> Reading Assistants</h4>
<p class="noindent">The provision of a reading assistant is not the only possible accommodation for a blind employee. There are technological advances that, in fact, may prove superior to a reading assistant. In <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01952691 (1996), the Commission found that although the agency endeavored to provide technological assistance, it had not reasonably accommodated the complainant because the equipment never properly worked. Moreover, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bernard</span>, held that the provision of a reading assistant did not constitute reasonable accommodation under the circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Record evidence indicates that appellant would be able to perform the essential duties of the VBC position with reasonable accommodation. Consequently, the Commission finds that appellant is a qualified individual with a disability. The issue, then, is whether the agency met its obligation to reasonably accommodate appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Technical Assistance Manual on the Employment Provisions of the Americans' With Disabilities Act (ADA) provides the following guidance as to what constitutes a reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done that enables a qualified individual with a disability to enjoy an equal employment opportunity.... Reasonable accommodation must be provided to enable a qualified applicant to perform the essential functions of the job s/he is seeking, and to enable a qualified employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job currently held.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at III-3. The Technical Assistance Manual further states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A reasonable accommodation must be an effective accommodation. It must provide an opportunity for a person with a disability to achieve the same level of performance or to enjoy benefits or privileges equal to those of an average similarly-situated nondisabled person.... A reasonable accommodation need not be the best accommodation available, as long as it is effective for the purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at III-3,4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The essential functions of the VBC position involved answering the telephone, using the Target system, and accessing information in written reference material. In performing these duties, appellant's primary problem was in accessing written materials. Although the equipment procured, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the Arkenstone System, was sufficient to perform these tasks, the agency failed to take the necessary steps to ensure that the System was fully operational or that appellant otherwise had access to the written reference materials and forms in an electronic format.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's expert witnesses testified that the Arkenstone System, in fact, could store and retrieve documents scanned into the PC by the use of a word processing program with search capability and by executing the proper keystrokes. Moreover, the Project Manager indicated that the Arkenstone manual was well written and clearly described how to set up and operate the System. She also indicated that the manual included an "800" telephone number for inexperienced users to obtain technical support. The record showed that agency officials were aware that the System was not working as anticipated as early as January 1993. In his testimony, the IRM Assistant Chief admitted that no one in IRM was experienced in the use of adaptive equipment. Nonetheless, record evidence fails to show that he ever read the manual, used the "800" number to obtain technical assistance, attempted to exchange or return the equipment to the company when it did not perform as expected, or suggested an outside contractor to set up the equipment and train appellant in its use. The Commission also notes that the IRM Assistant Chief admitted that he may have avoided going to appellant's terminal because of personality conflicts with VBC 2. Further, assuming that agency officials believed that appellant was unable to use the equipment to store and retrieve VBC reference materials, there is no evidence to show that they took any other steps, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, those recommended by the SAF Vocational Specialist, to make this information accessible to appellant electronically.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these facts, the Commission finds that the agency could have provided reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his position. That is, the agency could have provided functional adaptive equipment to appellant or taken other steps to make the VBS written reference materials accessible to him <span id="Page_1353"></span>in electronic format. In making this finding, the Commission recognizes that the agency did not receive the Arkenstone System until October 1992. Nonetheless, record evidence makes clear that the System never was fully functional and that appellant never was able to access the reference materials necessary to perform his job at any time during his tenure as a VBC (through September 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further finds that under the circumstances of this case, providing appellant with a full-time trainer/reader did not constitute a reasonable accommodation. One of appellant's essential duties was to obtain information for callers from written reference materials. Because appellant could not read these materials, he was totally dependent on a reader to locate information and communicate it to him. Both expert witnesses testified that the use of speech assisted technology was preferable to full-time reliance on a human reader because the individual could retrieve the information independently, and more quickly, as well as interpret it on his own. In addition, appellant described the problems he experienced when a trainer/reader was away from his workstation. Moreover, the Commission notes that this was not a temporary measure but a situation that was ongoing for at least 9 months. Under the circumstances, the Commission finds that the provision of a reader was not an effective accommodation, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it was not adequate to enable appellant to perform the essential functions of the position. Consequently, the Commission finds that the agency did not meet its duty to provide appellant reasonable accommodation by the use of a trainer/reader in place of functioning adaptive equipment or other access to written reference materials and forms in electronic format.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency presented a number of reasons as to why appellant's equipment was not functional, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the impending move, the lack of familiarity with adaptive equipment, and so on, there was no evidence to show that providing appellant with adaptive functional equipment or using some other method to make the written reference material accessible to him electronically would have constituted an undue hardship for the agency. In this regard, the Commission notes that the evidence failed to establish a financial limitation on the agency's ability to provide reasonable accommodation. Consequently, the Commission finds that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there are situations where a reading assistant is an appropriate accommodation in lieu of equipment modifications or acquisition. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120080209 (2010), the complainant, a blind claims representative, enrolled to take courses in the agency's GO Learn system. After he registered, he discovered he could not take the courses because the agency's online system was not compatible with the Job Access with Speech (JAWS) computer program that translates text to voice. The complainant requested as an accommodation that the agency make JAWS compatible with its GO Learn program. The agency responded that it could not make JAWS compatible with GO Learn because JAWS was a program purchased from an outside vendor. The agency did attempt to accommodate the complainant by providing him with a reading assistant and making equivalent course available to him. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, found that the agency had accommodated the complainant and that he was not entitled to the accommodation of choice where agency had provided an otherwise effective accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. After a review of the record, we find that the agency reasonably accommodated complainant. As the record reflects, the agency attempted to resolve the compatibility of JAWS with the GO Learn system, but was unsuccessful because the program was purchased from an outside vendor. The record further reflects, however, that the agency provided complainant with a reader assistant, and he could have worked on the GO Learn system with the reader assistant. Although complainant maintained that there was no time to work with his reader assistant on the GO Learn system, the record demonstrates that one day every other week employees are given the opportunity to not work on claims. Complainant could have used this time to work with his reader assistant on the GO Learn system. Moreover, the record reflects that complainant completed courses that were made available to him as a substitute to the GO Learn system and obtained certificates in those equivalent courses. The agency was not required to provide complainant with the accommodation of his choice, but could select between different accommodations as long as its selection was effective. 29 C.F.R. Part 1630; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities</span> at p 17. Therefore, we find that the agency reasonably accommodated complainant in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Donovan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120101794 (2010) (reading assistant for blind employee was reasonable accommodation where agency IT department was unable to install Dragon software on computer because of conflict with other software).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has drawn a distinction between reading assistants who enable an employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position and reading assistants who would essentially perform essential functions of the position for the employee. An agency is not required as a reasonable accommodation to provide the latter. In <span class="Italic">Porter v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A34131 (2004), the Commission found a complainant whose job consisted primarily of reading handwritten materials was not entitled to a reading assistant as a reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that providing visually impaired employees with readers is an accepted form of reasonable accommodation. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2) provides that reasonable accommodation may include but is not limited to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i) Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities: and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials, or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> complainant is an individual with a disability, we conclude that the agency has shown that providing complainant with a reader as an accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship on the agency. Here, complainant indicates that there is equipment that he could use to perform many of the duties of the Secretary position; namely, a Brailler, Braille paper and tape, a scanner, headphones for the computer, speech adaptive software for the computer, a sound probe for the telephone, and a cassette dictation machine to process letters and reports. Complainant also suggests that in the event that there were duties he was unable to complete, a "job swap" could occur, wherein he would perform some of the duties of another employee in exchange for helping complainant to accomplish his duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Area 9 Director for the Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) Compliance Division (D1), explains that while the agency could provide accommodations for complainant, he would still not be able to perform one of the essential functions of this position; namely, reading handwritten materials, unless he had a reader to assist him. In his affidavit, D1 states as follows: "In order to accomplish the many varied tasks of the Secretary position, a totally blind person would need to have someone do the proofreading and read all of the information that is needed to do the computer system inputs of inventory items, statute updates, status code updates, etc. That means someone else, not the individual with the disability, would be performing the essential functions of the Secretary position." Report of Investigation (ROI), at 150. As to complainant's contention that he could use a scanner to read typed material, D1 notes that 70 to 75% of the documentation handled by the Secretary is handwritten, and not typed. D1 explains that the "Revenue Agent Group receives a large volume of external mail from taxpayers which more often than not consists of handwritten envelopes, handwritten letters, and handwritten completed forms." ROI, at 152. Complainant does not dispute that the scanner cannot read handwritten material. D1 also addresses complainant's suggestion regarding a "job swap," stating that "Apart from the Secretary position at issue here, there are no other clerical or support staff positions in the Revenue Agent Group in which a "job swap" could occur to accommodate [complainant] for those duties he is unable to complete with or without the accommodation of adaptive equipment."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that reading handwritten materials is an essential function of the Secretary position at issue. Further, under the circumstances of this case, we find that providing a reader is not a reasonable accommodation for complainant. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952691 (March 28, 1996) (finding that providing a Veterans Benefits Counselor with a full time reader/trainer did not constitute a reasonable accommodation because one of the Counselor's essential duties was to obtain information for callers from written materials, and complainant was totally dependent on a reader to locate information and communicate it to him); <span class="Italic">Cox v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 03890126 (February 6, 1990) (finding that a part-time reader was a reasonable accommodation for complainant who was a library technician). In <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> the Commission found that the reader was not actually performing complainant's job responsibilities in that the reader was only needed to read titles to complainant, as complainant directed, and it was complainant who did the actual verification work by typing the titles into the computer and determining what classification the titles would fall under. We find that the instant case is more similar to Brown, in that here, the reader would be performing complainant's job responsibility for him if s/he was required to read every piece of handwritten material that crossed complainant's desk. Accordingly, we find that the agency has demonstrated that under the facts of this case, a reader would impose an undue hardship, and the agency has not violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to select complainant for the Secretary position.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that an agency obtain a separate reading assistance as a reasonable accommodation. However, if the agency relies upon coworkers <span id="Page_1354"></span>to assist an employee with an individual it is not an effective accommodation when some coworkers are not willing to assist the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">One issue with reading and other assistants is the availability of those individuals to employees who need them as accommodations. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120122085 (2014), the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment for the agency where questions of fact remained as to the availability of the assistant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second issue concerns the effectiveness of the accommodations Complainant was receiving. The Agency asserts that the accommodations it provided Complainant were sufficient to enable Complainant to do all of her work onsite. In contrast, Complainant claimed she struggled with the Dragon software because of the lag time and the difficulty in utilizing the software with Excel. Complainant also stated that although the Agency provided her with an assistant, this did not always work out as she needed to make an appointment with her and could not always anticipate when she would need assistance. Complainant stated that the assistant was sometimes unavailable because the assistant also worked with someone else. Consequently, Complainant often aggravated her condition and experienced increased pain in order to accomplish her work. Thus, it is unclear as to whether Complainant was actually receiving effective accommodation for her disability.</p>
