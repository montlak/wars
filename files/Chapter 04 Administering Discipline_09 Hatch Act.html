<h2 class="h2">HATCH ACT</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Working for the federal government is vastly different from most private sector jobs in that public servants must adhere to a number of rules, regulations, and restrictions. The rule that most protects our political system from improper influence and limits political activity within the executive branch is the Hatch Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Hatch Act gets a lot of publicity during presidential campaigns, but violations can occur anytime politics are involved. Before we break down the Hatch Act's rules, let's start with some key facts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Violating the Hatch Act is a serious matter. Violations can lead to a reduction in grade, suspension, reprimand, fines, a ban from federal service for up to five years, and even removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Does the Hatch Act require that the same rules be followed by all federal employees? The answer is a little more complicated than a simple yes or no. The Hatch Act rules generally apply to most federal executive branch employees and employees working at independent agencies classified under the legislative and judicial branches unless they are specifically excluded by law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Less and further restricted employees.</b> Other Hatch Act restrictions apply depending on whether the employee qualifies as a less restricted employee, further restricted employee, or high-level political appointee. The additional restrictions on further restricted employees apply to certain types of employees across agency lines in addition to all employees from certain agencies (mostly those involved in national security and law enforcement, serving in career SES positions, or certain adjudicatory roles).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Manager's role.</b> Your role is to uphold the ethical standards for federal employees and work with HR to ensure your employees know how to comply with the Hatch Act and avoid violations. You also serve as a role model, meaning you must abide by these rules as well.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a manager, you are always held to a higher standard. This is as true of the Hatch Act as it is of any other law, rule, or policy. In particular, you can expect a very serious reaction to anything that smacks of an attempt to exert political influence on subordinates, suppliers, or clients. All it takes is one complaint to the Office of Special Counsel, which is charged with enforcement of the Hatch Act, or to your agency inspector general.</p>
<h3 class="h3">When political activity occurs</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Understanding the Hatch Act's political activity rules can be challenging because they are complex and extensive. There are a number of items to consider when you know or suspect that political activity has occurred. To help your base of knowledge, the items outlined below are important and will help you to avoid inadvertently violating the political activity rules. Be sure to review each item because going over just a few will leave you only partially prepared.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Understand the penalties for violations and know who to contact in HR for Hatch Act issues.</b> The Hatch Act is complicated even for seasoned professionals whose job it is to deal with these rules on a daily basis. This means that you must use HR as a resource when faced with a Hatch Act situation. Permitting a rules violation is risky because you or your employees could face severe penalties. The possible penalties for violating the Hatch Act include removal, reduction in grade, being barred from federal service for up to five years, suspension, reprimand, or a civil fine up to $1,195.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When political activity comes up, managers must ensure they and their employees are aware of which political activities are permitted and prohibited. It's not necessary to memorize every rule, but you should have a general understanding so that when violations or possible violations occur, you'll know to consult HR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Grasp the definition of 'political activity' under the Hatch Act.</b> Political activity is anything geared toward the success or failure of a partisan political candidate, group, or party. This definition is broad and encompasses even minor political activity. You don't have to protest in a picket line about a certain candidate to qualify as political activity. Even simply clicking "like" on Facebook counts as political activity if it involves a partisan candidate, group, or party.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Research the specific rules for lesser and further restricted employees.</b> In addition to the five main prohibitions outlined below, federal employees must abide by another set of rules depending on whether they fall into the less restricted employees, further restricted employees, or high-level political appointee category.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This means managers must know whether their employees fall into the less or further restricted category. Generally, employees are less restricted employees, unless they qualify as a further restricted employee or another exemption.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Further restricted employees are generally from specific law enforcement and intelligence agencies, career SES, administrative law judges, administrative appeals judges, and members of contract appeals boards. They have tighter restrictions on their political activity, so not only do they have to abide by the rules for less restricted employees, they also have to follow an additional set of restrictions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Five general prohibitions on political activity.</b> The Hatch Act has five main prohibitions that apply to most federal employees. The first four apply at all times, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. The fifth rule applies depending on the time, place, and manner of the political activity. Under the 24/7 prohibitions, federal employees may not:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. Use their official authority or influence to affect the outcome of an election.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">This means you may not try to politically influence subordinate employees, mentees, or trainees. As a manager, influencing your employees' political activities is inherently coercive. Mentors and trainers are treated the same as managers under this rule. Therefore, mentors and trainers may not politically influence their mentees and trainees. In addition:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> This rule does not merely mean that you can't force employees to attend a certain political fundraiser. For example, it also means you cannot send them an invitation or make a passing comment like, "Hey, you should come to this fundraiser." Managers are also prohibited from sending a political advocacy email to a subordinate.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You may not use your official title or position when engaging in political activity. This means you cannot be a keynote speaker at a political fundraising event or otherwise use your title when engaging in political activity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Beware of how you use social media. You can fill out the political views field on your Facebook, Twitter, or other social media profile and identify your place of work. However, if you do so, you cannot then express your political views there, such as by blogging on that account, because that would count as using your title or position to affect the outcome of an election. You also cannot convert your personal social media account to an official one if doing so would transfer over political content.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be especially careful if you have subordinates as Facebook "friends" or Twitter "followers." If you do not identify your position and agency, then you may advocate for or against a political party, group, or candidate on social media if "friends" with subordinate employees but only if the statements are directed at all social media "friends" or "followers." You may not direct political advocacy statements specifically toward subordinate employees or to a subset of friends that includes subordinates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. Solicit, accept, or receive political contributions.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a manager, you must understand the extensive actions covered under the prohibition against soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions. Under this ban, federal employees:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May not work a phone bank if asking for contributions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May not ask for donations whether by mail, email, or social media.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May not host a fundraiser, invite others to a fundraiser, share or like posts about political contributions on social media.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You must take special care when it comes to technology. Federal employees violate this rule when:</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Forwarding emails with donate buttons, invitations to fundraising events, or links to donation pages.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Sharing, liking, tweeting, or retweeting solicitations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Liking a friend's post that asks for donations to a candidate. However, liking a candidate on Facebook where the candidate is not asking for donations is not a violation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees are not responsible for the acts of a third party that occur on their own social media pages. If a federal employee's friend posts a link to the contribution page of a political party, partisan candidate, or partisan political group, or otherwise solicits political contributions, the employee does not need to take any action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>3. Be candidates in partisan elections.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Hatch Act, an individual is considered a candidate by:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Collecting signatures for nominating petitions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Fundraising.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Announcing candidacy to the press or public.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assembling a campaign committee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Filing nominating petitions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Forming an exploratory committee to determine whether candidacy would be a viable option.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Having a political action committee raise money on the employee's behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Note, however, that the holding of a partisan political office does not violate the Hatch Act. Only the partisan candidacy for the office violates the Hatch Act. For example, if an employee was elected to a partisan political office prior to commencing federal service, continuing to hold the position after starting their federal job wouldn't violate the Hatch Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>4. Solicit or discourage political activities of a person with business before their agency.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal employees may not knowingly solicit or discourage the political activity of anyone with business pending before their employing office. Business includes an ongoing audit, investigation, or enforcement, application for a grant, contract, license, permit, ruling, compensation, or certificate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>5. Engage in political activity when on duty, in the federal workplace, wearing a government uniform or official insignia, or operating a government vehicle.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Hatch Act defines political activity broadly to encompass any activity directed toward the success or failure of a partisan candidate, party, or group. Employees may not engage in anything that falls under this definition of political activity while:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>On duty.</b> The term "on duty" includes your regular work hours, plus any time spent teleworking or on official time for union duties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>In the federal workplace.</b> This term includes any government facility even if you are off duty. The term encompasses break rooms, conference rooms, union offices if inside a federal building, along with gyms and cafeterias in the federal building.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Wearing an official uniform or insignia.</b> This term also covers agency logos even if they do not show the agency name, along with casual agency apparel such as T-shirts or hats.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Using a government vehicle.</b> A government vehicle includes vehicles that are government owned, sponsored, leased, or rented for government purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Keep in mind that technology makes this rule particularly challenging because employees often use their smartphones, emails, and internet access at various times during the day at work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While on duty, in the federal workplace, wearing official uniforms or insignia, or using a government vehicle, federal employees may not:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Display partisan political screen savers, posters, candidate photographs, etc.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Display iPad or smartphone cases or covers with pro-candidate images.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Make partisan political online donations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Send a partisan political email, blog, tweet, or post on social media, regardless of whether they are using a personal device or email account.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Share or forward partisan political content authored by others.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Share or forward partisan political content to friends or like-minded coworkers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Display coffee mugs, buttons, or other paraphernalia with partisan political messages such as "Vote for...," "I support...," or "Register for..."</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Place political bumper stickers on government vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Social movements.</b> Wearing T-shirts or masks supporting social movements, such as "Black Lives Matter" or "Blue Lives Matter" logos, have become popular. However, employees should be warned that they could be violating the Hatch Act if such support or expression is in conjunction with a partisan candidate, partisan political party, or partisan group.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee merely shows support for or opposition to Black Lives Matter or Blue Lives Matter, it is not prohibited by the Hatch Act, even if the activity occurs on duty or in the workplace. So, wearing a pin, T-shirt, mask, or similar item that says Black Lives Matter or Blue Lives Matter is not prohibited in the workplace by the Hatch Act if the expression remains nonpartisan. In addition, generally under the Hatch Act, employees may attend protests supporting nonpartisan issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, the display of such a phrase at work would likely constitute prohibited political activity if it appears in conjunction with speech or statements about a candidate, political party, or elections. Wearing a T-shirt that states "Black Lives Matter" with the words "Democratic National Party" or "Vote Democrat" underneath on a work video call would not be permitted. Similarly, wearing a mask to work with "Blue Lives Matter" and the words "Vote Republican" underneath would constitute prohibited political activity that violates the Hatch Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally under the Hatch Act, attending protests supporting nonpartisan issues is treated the same as other social movements such as the Women's March or gun rights protests. Employees may attend.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While agencies may not use the Hatch Act as a basis for prohibiting permissible expression, there may be other laws, rules, or regulations that may apply and govern employee conduct while in the workplace or on duty. Employees still must ensure they are not violating any agency conduct policy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some agencies, for example, have standards of conduct that clearly state employees may be disciplined for making defamatory or irresponsible statements. To be safe, encourage employees to consult with the agency ethics or legal office for additional guidance when the situation is unclear.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Take action when you see a potential violation.</b> You cannot ignore violations of the Hatch Act. As a manager, you set the tone for your employees. If you ignore Hatch Act violations, your employees will continue to violate the prohibitions thinking no one is monitoring them. Eventually, someone may report the issue up the chain of command, which could lead to disciplinary action against you. You may even want to arrange for Hatch Act training which will put staff on notice that you and others will be monitoring adherence, and it will help everyone understand limits and prohibitions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By taking violations seriously, you have a better chance of rectifying small issues before they require disciplinary action. Often enough, employees mistakenly believe a particular political activity is allowed. If you see a minor violation, talk to HR about your options. If a violation is very minor, HR may advise warning the employee to ensure the employee does not engage in that particular activity again. If the employee continues to engage in the violation, HR may advise you to proceed with discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For more complicated violations, HR may decide to involve the OSC, which can provide guidance on how to proceed. Sometimes the OSC helps obtain a settlement with the employee, where the employee agrees to a certain form of discipline. Other times, the OSC may choose to prosecute the violation in front of the MSPB.</p>
<h3 class="h3">When nonpartisan becomes partisan</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Sometimes employees get involved in heated discussions about current events or issues, and you might become concerned they are engaging in political activity prohibited by the Hatch Act. This chapter will help you recognize whether these conversations have moved into partisan territory -- and therefore violate the Hatch Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While talking about current events may start out as nonpartisan -- unrelated to a political party or candidate -- these discussions can become political activity when combined with something that advocates for or against a political party, partisan political group, or a candidate for partisan political office. For example, generally the Hatch Act would not prohibit comments or displays on abortion or gun rights. However, these nonpartisan issues can easily become Hatch Act-prohibited political activity if the employee is using the discussion to advocate for or against the Republican or Democratic political party or candidate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Factors to consider.</b> When investigating allegations that on-duty discussions or presentations about current events or policy issues might be prohibited political activity, the Office of Special Counsel will consider the following factors:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The content of the discussion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The timing of the discussion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The size and composition of the audience.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The relationship of the participants involved.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The context in which the discussion occurred.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The medium used, such as email or in-person contact.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether a candidate or party is mentioned, even if there is no express advocacy for or against the candidate or party.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Less restricted employees</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Hatch Act places different levels of restrictions on two categories of employees -- less restricted and further restricted employees. Generally, less restricted employees may actively participate in political campaigns or partisan political management, so long as they follow certain limitations. This means less restricted employees must abide by the five main prohibitions in addition to the rules for less restricted employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most federal employees are less restricted unless they serve in a position of higher responsibility such as law enforcement, national security issues or intelligence, administrative judges, or career Senior Executive Service. Less restricted employees include General Schedule, wage grade, presidential appointees with Senate confirmation, Schedule C, and noncareer Senior Executive Service members who do not work for agencies with further restricted employees. If you're uncertain about whether one of your employees is less or further restricted, contact your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Less restricted employees may generally:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Register with a political party and vote.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assist in voter registration drives.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Distribute partisan election campaign material on their own time, off federal property, and not while wearing official insignia or uniforms, or driving government vehicles.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Engage in partisan political campaigning such as organizing campaign events and speaking on behalf of a candidate.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Engage in partisan political management such as holding party office, organizing party events, and serving on party committees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Contribute money to political organizations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Attend fundraising functions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Join a political party or club.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be candidates for public office in a non-partisan election.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> They may not, however:</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use official authority or influence to interfere with an election. This includes using an official title for political purposes or coercing subordinates to volunteer or contribute to a campaign.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Solicit or discourage political activity with anyone with business before their agency.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Solicit or receive political contributions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be candidates in partisan elections. An election becomes partisan when a candidate receives the endorsement of a political party, uses political party resources, or announces candidacy on behalf of a political party. Exemptions are granted by the Office of Personnel Management for certain communities with high percentages of government employees as residents.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Participate in partisan activities while on duty, in a government office, while wearing an official uniform, or while using an official government vehicle.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Wear political buttons at work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Send or forward emails attempting to sway the political opinions of colleagues while on duty, on federal property, or using government equipment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Write blog posts that express support or opposition to partisan political candidates and political parties while on duty, on federal property, or using government equipment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Post links to the contribution web page of any political party, groups, or candidates.</li>
</ul><h3 class="h3">Further restricted employees</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Further restricted employees have the heaviest burden under the Hatch Act, as they are encumbered by more political restrictions than their counterparts, less restricted employees. Further restricted employees may <i>not</i> actively participate in political campaigns or partisan political management. This means further restricted employees must abide by the five main prohibitions in addition to the rules for further restricted employees -- which are more stringent than the specific rules for less restricted employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal employees are further restricted if they work at one of the agencies or in one of the positions on the further restricted employees list below. Generally, further restricted employees come from law enforcement, national security, or intelligence agencies. In addition, regardless of the agency, administrative judges and career Senior Executive Service qualify as further restricted. If you're uncertain about whether one of your employees is less or further restricted, contact your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies and employees subject to the greater restrictions of the Hatch Act are known as further restricted employees. They include individuals working at the following agencies or in the following positions:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Central Intelligence Agency.</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Social media: general information</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">All federal employees should be very cautious about using government computers or work time to post to their own or other social media accounts since expressions of political opinion and partisan political activity may easily creep into posts. Even when employees engage in political communications on their own time, they may run afoul of the Hatch Act if they do so while on duty or simply like a post inviting supporters to a political fundraiser.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your HR office or designated agency ethics officer should be consulted periodically to ensure your employees receive regular training on the Hatch Act, as the OSC periodically updates its guidance on how to avoid Hatch Act violations when using social media. Regular training and reminders are important because the OSC often makes clarifications or changes that account for technological developments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Social media platforms -- such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. -- can lead to violations unless employees are careful when posting, following, liking, tagging, sharing, retweeting, and engaging in other similar activities. To avoid penalties for violating the Hatch Act, not only must employees be vigilant about how they use social media, but they must also know when and where they are prohibited from using social media to engage in political activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How much employees must restrict their political activity, including on social media, depends on whether they qualify as less restricted employees or further restricted employees. In addition, five general prohibitions apply to federal employees regardless of whether they qualify as less or further restricted. The OSC splits these five prohibitions into two groups -- the on duty or at the workplace prohibition and the 24/7 prohibitions. Unless an exception applies, generally federal employees may <b>not</b>:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Engage in political activity while on duty, in a government office, or using a government vehicle -- the on duty or at the workplace prohibition.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Use their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect an election at any time -- a 24/7 prohibition.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Knowingly solicit or discourage the political activity of anyone with business before their employing office at any time -- a 24/7 prohibition.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Knowingly solicit or receive political contributions at any time -- a 24/7 prohibition.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">5.</span> Be a candidate for public office in a partisan election at any time -- a 24/7 prohibition.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3">Social media: universal restrictions</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">On duty or at the workplace prohibition <b>-- may nots.</b> Generally, employees may not post, like, share, or retweet a message or comment in support of or opposition to a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group while on duty or in the workplace, even if their social media account is private. For example, while on duty or in the workplace, employees may not:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Like or share a post about an upcoming event supporting a candidate in a partisan race while eating lunch at the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Like or retweet a presidential tweet endorsing a congressional candidate while they are teleworking from home and on duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Like, follow, or friend the social media account of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group while on duty or in the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use an alias on social media to engage in any activity that is directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group while on duty or in the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Post, share, tweet, or retweet from personal social media accounts that display a political party or current campaign logo or the photograph of a candidate in a partisan race as a profile picture.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>On duty or at the workplace -- may dos.</b> Employees may:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Like or tweet a message encouraging others to vote for a favored candidate in a partisan race when they are at home after work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Like or share a friend's post about an upcoming event supporting a political party from a personal iPad when teleworking from home and on a lunch break in which they are not in a pay status.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Continue to follow, be friends with, or like the official social media accounts of government officials after those officials become candidates for reelection, such as continuing to follow the Twitter accounts of the president or members of Congress after they announce their candidacies for reelection.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Display a political party or current campaign logo or the photograph of a candidate in a partisan race as a profile picture on personal Facebook or Twitter accounts. However, they may not post, share, tweet, or retweet on those accounts while on duty or in the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Display a political party or campaign logo or photograph of a candidate in a partisan race as a cover or header photograph on their personal Twitter or Facebook account, such as using a recent photograph taken with a candidate in a local partisan race as the header on a personal Facebook account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>24/7 prohibitions -- may nots.</b> At any time, employees may not knowingly solicit, accept, or receive a political contribution for a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group, nor use their official authority or influence to affect the outcome of an election. In applying these rules to social media, employees <b>may not</b>:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Post or tweet a message that solicits political contributions or invites people to a fundraising event, such as tweeting a message asking Twitter followers to contribute five dollars to help a candidate in a local partisan race or posting a message on Facebook inviting friends to join you at a political party's annual fundraising event.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Like, share, or retweet a post that solicits political contributions, including invitations to fundraising events, such as tweeting a message offering to match the donation of the first five friends who donate to a certain candidate in a local partisan race, or liking or sharing a message posted on your Facebook page or a tagged post that asks for donations for a partisan political group.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use an alias on social media to solicit a political contribution for a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or a partisan political group.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use their official titles or positions when posting messages directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group. For example, an employee may not mention his official title or position when posting a positive comment on the Twitter account of a candidate in a local partisan race while off duty or away from the workplace, even if the Twitter account is private.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use a LinkedIn account to post or share messages directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group when the LinkedIn profile headline includes their official title or position.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use a social media account designated for official purposes to post or share messages directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group. All such official social media accounts should remain politically neutral. For example, an employee who accesses a Twitter account used for official purposes may not retweet or like a political party's tweet expressing support for a candidate in a partisan race.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Engage in political activity on a personal social media account if they are using such accounts for official purposes or posting in their official capacities. According to the Office of Special Counsel, no single factor is dispositive. Factors indicating a personal social media account is being used in ways that suggests it is an official social media account include whether the account:
<ol class="num-ri">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span>Contains little to no personal content.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Identifies the individual as a federal employee.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Extensively uses photographs of the employee's official activities.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Often references, retweets, likes, comments, or otherwise shares material related to official activities.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">5.</span> Is linked to an agency website or other official page.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>24/7 prohibitions -- may dos.</b> Generally, so long as they do not violate the on duty or at the workplace prohibition, employees may:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Donate to the campaign of a candidate in a partisan race.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Leave posts on their Facebook pages or not un-tag their names from posts that ask for donations for partisan political groups.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Accept invitations to, or mark themselves as "attending," fundraising events on social media when not on duty or in the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Include their official titles, positions, and where they work in their social media profiles, even if they also include their political affiliations or otherwise use their accounts to engage in political activity. For example, while away from the workplace and off duty, employees may post Facebook messages or tweets supporting a candidate in a partisan race on their Facebook or Twitter accounts which include their official titles or positions, where they work, and their political affiliations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Friends with subordinates</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Be especially careful if you have subordinates as Facebook friends or Twitter followers. Although supervisors may friend or follow subordinates, supervisors may not try to influence the political activity of subordinates. Therefore, supervisors and managers may never send to subordinates, or to a subset of friends that includes subordinates, any message that is directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group. For example, supervisors <b>may not</b>:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Mention or use a subordinate's Twitter handle when tweeting support of a candidate in a partisan race; or</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Send their opinions about which candidate to support in a partisan election via Facebook Messenger to a recipient group that includes a subordinate employee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Social media: further restricted employees</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Further restricted employees, who include employees of particular law enforcement and intelligence agencies, career SES members, administrative law judges, and members of contract appeals boards, have tighter restrictions on their political activities. Make sure you know whether your agency or position is categorized as further restricted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Further restricted employees may not take an active part in partisan political management or campaigning. Therefore, when using social media, they:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May not share or retweet posts from, or the page of, a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group at any time, even if they are not on duty or in the workplace. For example, further restricted employees may not:
<ol class="num-ri">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Share a political party Facebook post about voting on Election Day, even when at home using a personal cell phone.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Share the campaign Facebook page of a candidate in a partisan race, but they may like the page.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Share a post from a friend who shared a Facebook post from the campaign of a presidential candidate.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May not link to campaign or other partisan material of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group, even if they are not on duty or in the workplace. For example, further restricted employees may not:
<ol class="num-ri">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Include in their Facebook profiles the link to the website of a candidate in a partisan race.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Tweet a message in support of a candidate in a partisan race that includes a link to that candidate's Twitter account.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">However, while not on duty or in the workplace, further restricted employees <b>may</b>:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Post to or like the social media accounts or messages of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group. For example, if a friend is running for Congress, further restricted employees may like the campaign Facebook page or post a message of support on the friend's page, provided they are not on duty or in the workplace and do not violate any other prohibitions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Engage in political activity on social media, provided it is not done in concert with or on behalf of a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group. For example, further restricted employees may tweet their own messages advocating the defeat of a presidential candidate, provided they are not on duty or in the workplace and do not violate any other prohibitions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Teleworkers</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Make sure that employees understand that even when they are teleworking, they are subject to the Hatch Act's on-duty restrictions. For example, if an employee wants to post their views about a candidate on social media or make a political donation, they must ensure that they are not on duty when engaging in such activities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees who are working a regular work schedule while teleworking have the same on-duty status as if they were reporting to their regular duty stations. They are subject to the Hatch Act's on-duty prohibition during the hours they are working. Note that, unless agency policy says otherwise, employees are not considered on duty, i.e., in a pay status, during their lunch break. Employees who work irregular hours are considered on duty any time they are performing official duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Social media use.</b> The rule that employees may not post, like, share, or retweet a message or comment in support of or opposition to a political party, candidate in a partisan race, or partisan political group while on duty or in the workplace &#x2013; even if their social media account is private &#x2013; applies equally to employees in the agency workplace and to teleworkers. Here are some examples to help you understand how this plays out for an employee who is teleworking:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is teleworking from home and on his lunch break, in which he is not in a pay status. The employee is looking at Facebook on his personal iPad and sees that a friend posted a message about an upcoming event supporting a political party. Because the employee is on his lunch break and not in a federal building, he may like or share that post.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is teleworking from home and looking at Twitter on her personal computer. She sees that the president tweeted an endorsement of a congressional candidate. She may not like or retweet that message while on duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is teleworking and looking at Facebook on his personal smartphone. He sees that a Senate candidate posted a message asking for votes on Election Day. He may not post a comment in support of that message while on duty.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Videoconferencing and other virtual communications.</b> Employees who telework are likely regularly required to participate in videoconferencing, using platforms such as Skype, Teams, or Zoom. While participating in work-related videoconferencing, employees are subject to the same on-duty Hatch Act restrictions as when they attend meetings or communicate in-person with others at work. This means that during work-related videoconferencing, employees should not:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Wear a campaign t-shirt or hat.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Have any partisan materials -- such as campaign signs or candidate pictures -- visible to others.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use a profile picture for the videoconferencing application that shows support for or opposition to a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office (for example, candidate images, campaign slogans, or political party symbols).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">You are responsible for complying with the Hatch Act and working with HR to ensure your employees know how to avoid violations. Although it's not necessary to memorize each rule verbatim, you should be able to spot potential Hatch Act violations so you can approach HR to figure out how to address the situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Use social media to engage in political activity at the office or while on duty.</b> Federal employees may not engage in political activity while at a federal workplace, on duty, wearing official apparel or insignia, or using a government vehicle. This includes posting political comments on Facebook, liking a partisan political post, or tweeting a link to a political article. Remember political activity is any activity that is directed toward the success or failure of a partisan political candidate, party, or group.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Use email to forward political emails.</b> Although this sounds easy, employees often forget that political emails count as political activity. That means employees cannot forward or send them while on duty or at a federal workplace. In addition, political emails often have links to political contribution pages. So employees have to be doubly careful even when sending them while off duty or away from a federal workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Forget that you also have to comply with the Hatch Act.</b> As a manager, you set the tone for your employees. If you are posting political items on Facebook during the workday, your employees will think that they can do the same. Eventually, someone may report the issue up the chain of command, which could lead to disciplinary action against you.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore Hatch Act violations by your subordinates.</b> You cannot ignore any violations of the Hatch Act. If you ignore Hatch Act violations, your employees will continue to violate the prohibitions thinking no one is monitoring them. This will allow the problem to only get worse over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. May a federal employee engage in political activity while wearing a shirt with his agency's logo if he is off duty and away from government property?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Since others could interpret the agency logo as an official uniform, an employee may not engage in political activity while wearing the shirt even when off duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. May I put a political bumper sticker on my personal car?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes with some limitations. Generally, federal employees may place a partisan bumper sticker on their car and park it in a federal parking lot. The employee must cover the bumper sticker if the car is used for official duties and can be clearly identified as being used for official duties. In addition, federal employees may not turn their vehicles into campaign mobiles by displaying bumper stickers in a way that would rise to the level of political activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. May a federal employee post a link to a candidate's Facebook contribution page from her own?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Both further and less restricted employees are prohibited from posting links that go to a partisan group or candidate's contribution page at any time, regardless of how the employee posts the link. This means that employees may not link to a candidate's Facebook contribution page.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. When can a federal employee get involved with fundraising as part of a political action committee?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Under a very narrow exception to the general proscription against political contributions, certain less restricted employees may solicit, accept, or receive political contributions for a qualifying multicandidate political committee of a federal labor or employee organization. This exception only applies when fundraising for a political action committee that qualifies as a multicandidate political committee of a federal employee or labor organization. However, employees must remember that this exception only applies if all of these criteria are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonetheless, federal employees may make voluntary allotments of their own salary to political action committees, if they work for an agency that allows them to do so. To avoid violating the on-duty prohibition, employees should obtain blank direct deposit forms from the payroll office to make such an allotment, but complete them while not on duty, in a federal workplace, wearing an official uniform, or using a government vehicle. In addition, employees must remember to mail the completed forms and should not personally deliver any of these types of forms to the payroll office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does volunteering my time for a political campaign count as a prohibited political contribution?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Political contributions do not include the value of services provided without compensation by any individual who volunteers on behalf of any candidate, campaign, political party, or partisan political group, according to the OSC. Therefore, an employee is not making a political contribution when volunteering for any of these individuals or groups but must still make sure to comply with the remaining Hatch Act rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does being friends with subordinates on Facebook violate rules on using official authority?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Federal employees are prohibited from using their official authority to influence elections or other people's political activities, including subordinates. Therefore, when friends with subordinates, federal employees could violate the official authority prohibitions if they post anything on Facebook or other social media that influences a subordinate's political activities. According to the OSC, a manager's statements must be directed at all Facebook friends, and not specifically at subordinate employees. For example, a supervisor is permitted to post an opinion about a candidate in the status field. However, a manager is not permitted to specifically direct political statements to subordinate employees in a Facebook message or in an email. The distinction is whether the manager was specifically targeting the subordinates or whether the subordinates see the manager's statements by chance. As an additional restriction, further restricted employees may not post links to these groups or individuals even if the link is not targeting subordinates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are federal employees on duty when they take lunch or a break?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Generally, employees are not treated as "on duty" during meals and breaks. However, if they are still at a federal workplace during a meal or break period, they are prohibited from engaging in any political activity. This means that they may not engage in political activity in the cafeteria of a federal building even when the cafeteria is in a space leased by a contractor, according to the regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, whether an individual is permitted to engage in political activity during a break that is off federal property is likely to depend on the type of employee. For example, a less restricted employee may stuff envelopes for a mailing on behalf of a candidate for partisan political office while sitting in the park during a lunch period if he is not considered to be on duty during lunch. A further restricted employee may not do so if this activity rises to the level of actively engaging in political campaigns.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can a federal employee put a sign in front of her house supporting the Republican or Democratic presidential nominee?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Generally, employees may place a sign or banner supporting a partisan political candidate in front of their home, although further restricted employees must make sure they do not do so in concert with a partisan political party, group, or candidate. This means that further restricted employees are permitted to put up a sign supporting the candidate, but they cannot put up a sign that was paid for, sponsored by, or requested by the candidate's political party. For example, an individual may display a homemade sign stating "Smith for Senate," but not a sign printed by the Republican Party, or one stating that it was sponsored by the Democratic Party.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are there any restrictions on liking someone or something on Facebook?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Federal employees may friend, like, or follow the social media pages of a partisan group, party, or candidate, but not while on duty or at the federal workplace. However, further restricted employees, who want to like, fan, friend, or follow must not do so if the action involves posting, linking to, sharing, or retweeting partisan material from a party, group, or candidate.</p>
