<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Elements of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span></span> Case</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> spoke in terms of disparate treatment, the actual theory is much broader. The facts that give rise to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case are those facts which "if unexplained reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Weinstein v. USPS</span>, 01830674 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932793 (1994), the Commission expressed the requirements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case another way:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to satisfy this burden, appellant must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the alleged bases<span class="Italic">. McDonnell Douglas, supra; Furnco Construction Co. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567 (1978). This means that appellant must present a body of evidence such that, were it not rebutted, the trier of fact could conclude that unlawful discrimination did occur.</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure to establish a specific element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case "may be overcome if appellant sets forth some evidence of agency actions from which, if otherwise unexplained, an inference of discrimination can be drawn." <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934794 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Jatoi v. Hurst-Euless-Bedford Hosp. Auth.</span>, 807 F.2d 1214, 1219 (5th Cir. 1987) and <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Roadway Express</span>, 687 F.2d 85, 86 (5th Cir. 1982)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996097 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Stated another way in <span class="Italic">Potter v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720120029 (2013);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claims of disparate treatment are generally examined under the tripartite analysis first enunciated in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). For a complainant to prevail, she must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination, i.e., that a prohibited consideration was a factor in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802; <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For instance, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment as alleged herein, Complainant must show that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action concerning a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (3) she was treated differently than similarly situated employees outside her protected class, or there is some other evidentiary link between membership in the protected class and the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">McCreary v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120070257 (Apr. 14, 2008); <span class="Italic">Saenz v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950927 (Jan. 9, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">At the outset, the reader should realize that direct evidence of discrimination exists in very few cases. In most cases, complainants must rely on circumstantial evidence. The inquiry starts by requiring the complainant to present a set of facts that would support an inference of discrimination if otherwise unexplained. Most often, this will involve a set of circumstances that reflect disparate treatment of employees in different protected categories. The theory is broad enough, though, to cover any set of circumstances that, if left unexplained, would support an inference of discrimination. This notion was reinforced recently by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Group</span>, 517 U.S. 368, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed.2d 433 (1996), discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination has been established, the focus is not on the inferences that are most likely or even more likely than not. The focus is entirely on whether the facts <span class="Italic">could</span> support an inference of discrimination. In virtually all circumstantial evidence cases, there will be other inferences that could be drawn from the same set of facts. In many cases, those other inferences will be as plausible, if not more plausible, than the inference that the employer has engaged in discrimination. That there are other inferences that could be drawn does not undermine the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. At this stage of the analysis, the complainant is not required to discredit the other inferences that could be drawn. In the first instance, it is incumbent upon the employer to assert which of those possible inferences actually motivated its conduct. The complainant's evidence is then evaluated to determine if the reasons asserted by the employer for acting are pretextual. The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis is based on narrowing the focus of the dispute through a three-step process in which the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is the first step.</p>
<p class="noindent">The exact elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case vary depending on the factual situation involved. In most cases, the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will consist of the appellant demonstrating that he is a member of a protected class, that the agency took some employment action, and that, in taking that action, the agency treated the appellant differently than similarly situated employees outside of the protected class. It is important to bear in mind that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> formula is for analytical purposes only. It does not dictate the order that evidence is presented at an EEO hearing. The appellant always bears the ultimate burden of proof on the issue of discrimination. Evidence important to the appellant's case should not be withheld during presentation of the case-in-chief on the assumption that the appellant will be allowed to introduce further evidence at the conclusion of the agency's defense.</p>
<p class="noindent">"Disparate treatment. . .is the most easily understood type of discrimination. The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex or national origin. . . ." <span class="Italic">Cox v. Department of Navy</span>, 01822334 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S.</span>, 431 U.S. 324 (1977)); <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978). The female appellant in <span class="Italic">Cox</span> failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination where similarly situated male employees also were required to perform duties above and below their officially assigned duties. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Reed v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01821369 (1983) (male appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where all similarly situated employees were male and the female alleged that the discriminating official hired the appellant). In <span class="Italic">Burke v. USPS</span>, 01830765 (1983), the appellant, a white male, alleged that denial of leave without pay (LWOP) for union activities was based on race discrimination. The EEOC found appellant failed to present a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because the evidence demonstrated that the only other union official at the installation, also a white male, was granted LWOP for union activities. The appellant failed to show that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees in a different protected group, even though he established that he was treated differently than another employee. In other words, because both the complainant and the comparison employee were of the same race and gender, the difference in their treatment did not support an inference that the difference was because of race or gender.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is essential to remember that Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act and the ADEA do not prohibit unfair treatment in general. They only prohibit unfair treatment if the basis of that treatment is one of those specifically listed in the respective acts. To equate unfair treatment with discrimination is to overlook the fundamental purpose of antidiscrimination laws.</p>
<p class="noindent">A failure to allege disparate treatment in the formal complaint can result in a finding of no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and be grounds for dismissal of the complaint as outside of the EEO purview. <span class="Italic">Gerlitz v. USPS</span>, 01830774 (1983) (allegations of poor treatment by the supervisor were insufficient to support a complaint of age discrimination where there is no allegation that younger employees were treated more favorably).</p>
<p class="noindent">The elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case may vary, and there is no rigid requirement that the complainant show she was treated less favorably than similarly situated males. "<span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Co. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567 (1978), teaches that it is sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by showing that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably than the complainant. It is not necessary, however, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by making this comparison where circumstances dictate otherwise." <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 01850845 (1986) (an allegation of discrimination under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and pregnancy is confined to females). Strict adherence to the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is inappropriate and the elements must be varied to properly frame the issue presented by the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01881467 (1988). In lieu of demonstrating that he was treated differently than a similarly situated coworker, a complainant may demonstrate that he was meeting the legitimate expectations of the agency and was disciplined without cause. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01910442 (1991). That the selectee was possibly of the same national origin as the complainant "should not logically or as a matter of law, foreclose appellant's ability to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on his national origin." <span class="Italic">Atencio v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01951627 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Atencio v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01975245 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent"> <span id="Page_685"></span>In some cases involving intentional discrimination, there are no similarly situated employees. In one such case, <span class="Italic">Bertels v. Postmaster General</span>, 01890365 (1989), the Commission explained the requirements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment in the terms and conditions of employment, which does not focus on the class status of other employees, appellant must demonstrate that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was the object an adverse employment action; and, (3) there was a causal relationship between membership in the protected class and the adverse actions suffered herein. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leftwich v. United States Steel Corporation</span>, 470 F. Supp. 758, 764 (W.D. Pa. 1979).</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite constant warnings by the Commission and the courts that the precise elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case are not rigid, but must vary with the factual circumstances of the case, complaints are still wrongly dismissed on the basis of a rigid application of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. As a result, over the years, the Commission's definition of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case has taken on broader dimensions. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01902727 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant must initially establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by demonstrating through a preponderance of the evidence, that he was subjected to adverse employment actions under circumstances which, if left unexplained, would raise an inference of discriminatory animus<span class="Italic">. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253; <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corporation v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 579-80 (1978). The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> elements are determined by the factual circumstances of the case and the bases of discrimination alleged. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802, n.13; <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, n.6; <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 358 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by presenting evidence which shows: (1) that he belongs to a statutorily protected class; (2) that his employment situation is comparable to those of employees outside his protected class; and (3) he was denied conditions or benefits of employment afforded those employees. <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. Morris Brown College</span>, 752 F.2d 558, 562 n.7 (11th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Potter v. Goodwill Industries of Cleveland</span>, 518 F.2d 864, 865 (6th Cir. 1975). . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">When there is no comparative for the purposes of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the complainant must be able to point to some other evidence that, if unrebutted, would at least permit an inference of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Gower v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950089 (1996), the Commission explained, in a case of alleged sex discrimination, how the complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case without use of a comparative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the present case, we find, contrary to the previous decision, that appellant met the burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on sex. The record indicates that appellant testified she informed her first level supervisor, S1, that she was pregnant, on the morning of September 3, 1992. S1, according to appellant, informed her that she was doing a good job. However, later that day, S2 and S3 informed appellant that she was being terminated because she had not shown sufficient improvement. After a careful review of the record, we find that appellant has presented sufficient evidence to create an inference of discrimination based on her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case brought under the ADEA, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Group</span>, 517 U.S. 368, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed.2d 433 (1996), held that comparative evidence is not an essential element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The court found it was not necessary for an age discrimination plaintiff to show he or she was treated differently than someone outside of his or her protected category. What was important, said the Court, was that the plaintiff come forward with sufficient evidence to create an inference of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Presumably, the <span class="Italic">O'Connor</span> decision is applicable to cases under Title VII. In deciding the case, the Supreme Court assumed that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis applied to ADEA cases. Although the case specifically dealt with age discrimination, its holding should apply to other kinds of cases using the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analytical mode. The Court, in <span class="Italic">O'Connor</span>, 116 S. Ct. at 1309-10, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing claims of age discrimination brought under the ADEA, the Fourth Circuit, like others, has applied some variant of the basic evidentiary framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. We have never had occasion to decide whether that application of the Title VII rule to the ADEA context is correct, but since the parties do not contest that point, we shall assume it. <span class="Italic">Cf. St. Mary's Honor Center, supra</span>, at 506 n.1 (assuming that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework is fully applicable to racial-discrimination-in-employment claims under 42 USC 1983). On that assumption, the question presented for our determination is what elements must be shown in an ADEA case to establish the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that triggers the employer's burden of production.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the very name--<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case--suggests, there must be at least a logical connection between each element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the illegal discrimination for which it establishes a legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption, <span class="Italic">Burdine, supra</span>, at 254, n.7. The element of replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement. The discrimination prohibited by the ADEA is discrimination because of [an] individual's age, 29 USC 623(a)(1), though the prohibition is limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of age, 631(a). This language does not ban discrimination against employees because they are aged 40 or older; it bans discrimination against employees because of their age, but limits the protected class to those who are 40 or older. The fact that one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age. Or to put the point more concretely, there can be no greater inference of age discrimination (as opposed to 40 or over discrimination) when a 40 year-old is replaced by a 39 year-old than when a 56 year-old is replaced by a 40 year-old. Because it lacks probative value, the fact that an ADEA plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class is not a proper element of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps some courts have been induced to adopt the principle urged by respondent in order to avoid creating a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case on the basis of very thin evidence--for example, the replacement of a 68 year-old by a 65 year-old. While the respondent's principle theoretically permits such thin evidence (consider the example above of a 40 year-old replaced by a 39 year old), as a practical matter it will rarely do so, since the vast majority of age discrimination claims come from older employees. In our view, however, the proper solution to the problem lies not in making an utterly irrelevant factor an element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, but rather in recognizing that the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case requires evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion. . .. <span class="Italic">Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 358 (1977) (emphasis added). In the age discrimination context, such an inference can not be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger. Because the ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not class membership, the fact that a replacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff is a far more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Saenz v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950927 (1998), the Commission reiterated the notion that a complainant need not necessarily show that she was treated differently than a similarly situated employee in order to show discrimination, and specifically relied upon <span class="Italic">O'Connor</span> in the context of a Title VII case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request for reconsideration, the agency argues strenuously that appellant cannot establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination because she was not similarly situated with the SBM. Specifically, the agency contends that in order for appellant to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, she must show that she is a member of a protected group, that she is similarly situated with a person or persons outside her group, and that the agency treated her less favorably than it treated the comparative employees. Although we acknowledge that this model often is used to determine whether a complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the Commission has ruled that proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will vary depending on the facts of the particular case<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01954762 (June 17, 1997); <span class="Italic">West v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01954208 (February 26, 1997). At a minimum, appellant must present evidence which, if unrebutted, would support an inference that the agency's actions resulted from discrimination. <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Co. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). It is not necessary, however, for appellant to show that a comparative individual outside her protected group was treated differently<span class="Italic">. O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caters Corp</span>., 116 S. Ct. 1307 (1996);<span class="Italic"> Enforcement Guidance on O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caters Corp.</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, n.4 (September 18, 1996); <span class="Italic">Carson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp</span>., 82 F.3d 157, 159 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Saenz</span>, the Commission found that a witness stating that the supervisor treated women more harshly than men and, in particular, treated Hispanic women more harshly, was sufficient evidence to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency has done all that is required, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, it is unnecessary to resolve the question of whether the complainant actually has stated a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Brickhouse v. Department of Labor</span>, 01863272 (1987). The analysis should proceed directly to the issue of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for the factfinder to consider the employer's legitimate reason, discussed in the section below on "<a href="0100-2023-19-008.html#sec10-9">Basis for Disparate Treatment</a>," in determining whether the employee presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. As noted by the court in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Denny's, Inc.</span>, 111 F.3d 1506 (10th Cir. 1997), to do so prevents the factfinder from even considering evidence of pretext. In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, the district court instructed a jury that, in a promotion case, the employee must show that he was at least as qualified for the position in question as the selectee in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> court, 111 F.3d at 1510-11, relying upon its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Kenworthy v. Conoco, Inc.</span>, 979 F.2d 1462 (10th Cir. 1992), found this instruction improper and explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_686"></span>In <span class="Italic">Kenworthy</span> we held the district court misapplied the law by holding that the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff's rejection could prevent the plaintiff from establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. 979 F.2d at 1469-70. We pointed out that relying on a defendant's reasons for the adverse action as a basis for ruling against a plaintiff at the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> stage raises serious problems under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework because it frustrates a plaintiff's ability to establish that the defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual. See reasons offered by the defendant for the failure to be promoted, the jury is not required to even consider the plaintiff's evidence on the critical issue of pretext. In <span class="Italic">Kenworthy</span> and in <span class="Italic">MacDonald v. Eastern Wyoming Mental Health Ctr.</span>, 941 F.2d 1115 (10th Cir. 1991), upon which <span class="Italic">Kenworthy</span> relied, we were concerned with subjective qualifications. Such subjective criteria "are particularly easy for an employer to invent in an effort to sabotage a plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and mask discrimination." <span class="Italic">Ellis v. United Airlines, Inc.</span>, 73 F.3d 999, 1005 n.8 (10th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 116 S. Ct. 2500 (1996). To avoid this result, we held, in agreement with other courts addressing the issue, that the employer's subjective reasons are not properly considered at the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> stage, and should instead be "considered in addressing whether those articulated reasons are legitimate or merely a pretext for discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Applying our holding, we stated that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing can be made through credible evidence that a plaintiff was qualified even if that evidence was disputed by the employer, and that this burden may be met through the plaintiff's own testimony and that of co-workers who were in a position to know the plaintiff's qualifications. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, as in <span class="Italic">Kenworthy</span> and <span class="Italic">MacDonald</span>, the qualifications at issue were purely subjective. As Denny's conceded in oral argument, it had no posted objective criteria that were applied across the board to all candidates for promotion. The record indicates that promotion decisions were made on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis, and were determined by the interviewer's subjective evaluation. Mr. Thomas presented evidence through his own testimony and that of Ms. Johnson, Mr. Kasim, Mr. Ahmed, and Mr. Smith that he was qualified to be promoted. This evidence was clearly sufficient under <span class="Italic">Kenworthy</span> to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and thus entitled Mr. Thomas to a proper instruction under which the jury could consider his evidence of pretext if it chose to credit his evidence of his qualifications. Instead, the jury found that Mr. Thomas had not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the erroneous instruction directing it to consider Denny's evidence that Mr. Thomas was not as qualified as those promoted. Because the court improperly instructed the jury that such a finding eliminated the need for it to consider pretext, Mr. Thomas was deprived of the opportunity to show that Denny's proffered reasons were not worthy of credence. Accordingly, we reverse the verdict on the discrimination claim under section 1981 and remand for a new trial under proper instructions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discussed below are some frequently recurring situations illustrating the demonstration of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
