<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-8"><span class="space">2.</span> Knowing and Voluntary Agreements</h4>
<p class="noindent">Any settlement agreement must be knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the parties. 29 CFR 1614.504(a). Any agreement that is knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the parties is binding. The knowledge requirement generally does not present a problem, except in cases where either the complainant or the agency contends a representative exceeded his or her scope of authority. The requirement that the agreement be voluntary has a greater prospect of presenting difficulties, especially if the complainant is not represented. Employees and agencies alike must do more than simply assert that an agreement was not entered into knowingly or voluntarily. An employee who enters into a settlement agreement with an agency that waives her rights to statutory remedies such as back pay must come forward with some evidence that the agreement was not entered into knowingly and voluntarily. Once the employee makes this facial showing, the Commission will carefully scrutinize the circumstances to determine if the employee entered the agreement voluntarily and knowingly. This will typically require the agency to make some showing that the agreement was, in fact, knowing and voluntary.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee, represented by counsel, cannot sign a settlement agreement and then later allege that he or she did not understand the full import of the resolution reflected in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Booker-Kemker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11850 (2002); <span class="Italic">Phipps v. USPS</span>, 01821994 (1982). Even when the complainant's representative is not a lawyer, the signing of the agreement by that representative undermines any allegation that the complainant signed under duress. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kirby v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01892629 (1989). Dissatisfaction with one's own representative does not support a finding that the complainant did not knowingly and voluntarily enter an agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956420 (1998) (rejecting complainant's argument that he could not see well enough to read the terms of a settlement agreement, in light of the fact that the agreement was also signed by a union representative). Similarly, an employee who is given adequate time to consider a settlement agreement will not be heard to complain of duress simply because not everything he asked for was included in the final agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01995603 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Employees who are not represented by counsel will not be held to a high standard of knowledge of the law, because EEO regulations place a burden on agency EEO counselors to explain an employee's rights under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. USPS</span>, 01832224 (1985) (consent was not voluntary and willing where the settlement precluded a back pay award and the appellant maintained that the EEO counselor informed her that reinstatement without back pay was her only statutory remedy).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an appellant is not represented does not give the agency a license to play fast and loose and then enforce provisions that the appellant clearly did not understand. In <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Postmaster General</span>, 019002360 (1990), the agency agreed to award the complainant back pay in accordance with the provisions of its labor relations manual. Subsequently, the agency denied the complainant any back pay on the basis that she did not make reasonable efforts to find alternative employment during her termination. The Commission found "it unreasonable to expect that appellant would have specific knowledge of the content of these provisions and the agency's interpretation of the regulations at issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although finding that the agreement failed to meet the knowing and voluntary requirement, the Commission did not void the agreement. Rather, it ordered the agency to award the complainant back pay. However, where agency counsel explains the provisions of the agreement to the appellant prior to signing the agreement, such explanation is sufficient to demonstrate the appellant's consent was knowing and voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Aiken v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01893357 (1989) (agency counsel submitted an affidavit attesting to his explanation of provisions to the appellant).</p>
<p class="noindent">A contract often is described as a "meeting of the minds." This is really just another way of expressing the requirement that the parties must knowingly and voluntarily enter a settlement agreement. On occasion, the Commission has invalidated agreements when it found there was no "meeting of the minds" between the two parties. For example, in <span class="Italic">Whitely v. USPS</span>, 01860881 (1986), an employee and his representative initialed a handwritten settlement agreement. They also signed a blank settlement form, on the representation that the initialed agreement would be typed onto the form. The agency then added provisions not in the handwritten agreement. The Commission reinstated the complaint with the well-taken comment that the employee, and especially his representative, should have known better than to sign a blank agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties must agree on all of the terms and conditions in order for there to be a "meeting of the minds" such that a binding contract is formed. Moreover, the agreement must be unequivocally accepted by both parties. In <span class="Italic">Newman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930458 (1993), the agency's representative and the complainant entered into a handwritten agreement. However, the agreement provided that it was subject to approval by other agency officials. Subsequently, the complainant was given a typewritten agreement that contained a few provisions, most notably a confidentiality clause, which were not in the original handwritten agreement. The complainant refused to accept the typewritten version and the agency issued a final decision withdrawing her complaint pursuant to the purported settlement agreement. The Commission found that an agreement never existed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission does not agree with the agency's interpretation of the law, as we discuss below. Nor do we agree that appellant did not argue the lack of an agreement on appeal, since she challenged the terms of the typed version. Moreover, in our view, the agency misstates the findings of the previous decision. There was no finding, as the agency contends, that P and P20 had not accepted the agreement. Rather, the previous decision found that the October 2nd document did not show any such agreement. The Commission affirms the reasoning and findings of the previous decision, and agrees that the October 2nd document was not a valid settlement agreement. Therefore, the agency's contentions in its RTR do not warrant reconsideration of the previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have concluded, however, that more than the October 2nd document must be considered before a conclusion can be reached on the validity of the agency's FAD. On appeal, the agency had argued that a valid oral agreement was formed when P and P20 subsequently accepted the October 2nd document. The agency argued that an oral agreement is valid and enforceable under Title VII, and cited to relevant authority. The previous decision did not address the argument, except perhaps implicitly by not considering evidence outside the four corners of the October 2nd document. We have decided to address it here, on our own motion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the EEOC Regulations in effect at the time the October 2nd document was written, a settlement reached in the administrative process must be in writing and signed by both parties. 29 CFR 1614.603. The Commission has upheld the validity of a settlement agreement entered into orally in one type of situation--during a hearing before an <span id="Page_340"></span>EEOC Administrative Judge, where the appellant later refused to execute a written reduction of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Rosa M. Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990). In upholding the validity of the oral agreement in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, we relied on the fact that the hearing transcript evidenced the agreement between the parties. We also noted that the subsequent written version of the agreement reflected the terms of the oral agreement that was evidenced in the hearing transcript.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we do not have an equivalent to the hearing transcript on which to bind the parties. As the previous decision found, the October 2nd document was not a valid agreement; the WRD employee's signature did not bind the agency. The agency characterizes the October 2nd document as an offer; therefore, if it were accepted, it could stand as the necessary writing. However, the facts do not support the agency's contention that it accepted the document. In the same meeting in which the WRD employee told appellant that P and P20 had approved the agreement, the WRD employee gave appellant the typed version of the agreement. The typed version contained additional terms, at least one of which was, we find, material. Added was the nondisclosure clause which appellant specifically objected to on the grounds that it violated her freedom of speech. Although the agency dismisses this change as merely the "standard EEO format," that does not change the fact that the clause was on a new subject and imposed a new obligation on appellant. Thus, the typed version differed materially from the October 2nd document.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effect was threefold. Given the fact that appellant was given the typed version at the same time she was informed that the agency approved the agreement, there is a question as to what terms the agency actually approved. This ambiguity is fatal to the agency's notion that it had an oral agreement, since the terms of an oral contract must be "reasonably certain." <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Gordon Flesch Company, Inc.</span>, 793 F.2d 858, 862 (7th Cir. 1986). Secondly, the typed version makes clear that the October 2nd document did not contain all the terms of the contract to be made. An offer, "to be legally operative and to create a power of acceptance must contain all the terms of the contract to be made." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). Finally, the agency's proffer of the typed version constituted a counter-offer, which effectively extinguished any offer in the October 2nd document. Restatement (Second) of Contracts 59 (1981). Accordingly, the Commission finds that no contract has been formed between the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the same reasons, the Commission finds no merit in the agency's argument that the terms of the October 2nd document prohibited appellant from withdrawing her agreement to the document. She withdrew after receiving the agency's typed version, at which time the October 2nd document had been rejected by virtue of the agency's counter-offer. Furthermore, it is illogical to characterize the October 2nd document both as appellant's offer and as an agreement binding on appellant. No contract had been formed on October 2nd; therefore appellant was not bound.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Commission finds that no settlement agreement was executed between appellant and the agency, we do not reach appellant's arguments regarding duress. There being no settlement agreement, we agree with the previous decision, as modified herein, that the agency's FAD rejecting appellant's complaint was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no meeting of the minds where a complainant signs the agreement in "protest" and attaches a memorandum stating additional corrective action he believes the agency should take. <span class="Italic">Kenwolf v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01956216 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">The knowing and voluntary requirement for settlement agreements is a two-way street that applies equally to agencies. An agency cannot void a settlement agreement on the basis that it violates its own internal policies where it has knowingly and voluntarily entered into the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Flores v. Postmaster General</span>, 01892552 (1989) (agency policies required employees to process 18 pieces of mail per minute, but the settlement agreement only required the complainant to process six pieces of mail per minute).</p>
<p class="noindent">One problem that has occurred with some frequency in settlement of EEO cases is whether an agreement is knowing and voluntary when it is signed by a party's representative and not the party. The Commission has dealt with cases involving both agencies and complainants where the claim is that the party did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement and that the representative lacked authority to enter the agreement. The Commission's decisions on these cases are not entirely consistent. These cases are discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-14-010.html#sec5-10">Signature of Agreements</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Another argument frequently advanced in claims that an agreement was not knowing and voluntary is that it was entered into under duress. Even where there is evidence of duress, acceptance of the benefits of the settlement agreement can bar a later claim to void the agreement. <span class="Italic">Swain v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01922465 (1992). In that case, the appellant accepted an extended term of employment with the agency in exchange for his ultimate voluntary resignation. After accepting the benefit of the agreement, appellant sought to have it set aside on the basis of duress. The Commission refused to void the agreement on the basis that the appellant had accepted the benefits of the agreement and waited almost six months to allege duress.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, on reconsideration, the Commission reversed its position, finding that acceptance of the benefit does not amount to ratification of the agreement when the agreement is signed under duress. Unfortunately, that did not help the complainant in <span class="Italic">Swain v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05921079 (1993), because the Commission also found his acceptance of the agreement was knowing and voluntary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision suggested that appellant was not entitled to so challenge the agreement because he had accepted the benefits of the contract, and its terms were therefore ratified. According to the previous decision, this was true even though there was some evidence in the record that appellant was pressured into signing the agreement and did not receive the benefit of counsel. <span class="Italic">Abhimanyu Swain v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922465 (September 9, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission upholds the validity of the settlement agreement at issue, we decline to apply a strict contract ratification theory. Retention of benefits received in exchange for a waiver of rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (hereinafter ADEA), 29 USC 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, does not bar a challenge to the validity of a waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forbus v. Sears Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 958 F.2d 1036 (11th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 113 S. Ct. 412 (1992). The existence of a tender-back requirement prior to challenging a waiver in the context of federal statutory rights is a matter of federal common law, not ordinary contract principles, and is best determined in light of the statutory purpose of the applicable statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Hogue v. Southern Railway Co.</span>, 390 U.S. 516 (1968) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). <span class="Italic">But see O'Shea v. Commercial Credit Corp.</span>, 930 F.2d 358 (4th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 112 S. Ct. 177 (1991); <span class="Italic">Grillet v. Sears Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 927 F.2d 217 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By both statutory and common law standards, to be valid, a waiver must be knowing and voluntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 626(f); <span class="Italic">Cirillo v. Arco Chemical Co.</span>, 862 F.2d 448 (3d Cir. 1988). In this case, the factors demonstrate a knowing and voluntary settlement of appellant's claim; thus on that basis, we uphold the previous decision's refusal to find the settlement agreement void....</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether an agreement was signed under duress, one of the factors the Commission looks at is the amount of time the complainant was given to consider the agreement. Also relevant is whether the complainant was permitted to engage in negotiations over any of the terms. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01954843 (1996), the Commission discussed both of these factors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A settlement agreement may be avoided if one of the parties establishes that assent was obtained by duress or coercion<span class="Italic">. See Mosley v. St. Louis Southwestern Railroad</span>, 634 F.2d 942 (5th Cir. 1981). The record indicates that Appellants A and B were each given only 24 hours to consider his or her respective proposed settlement agreement and did not have sufficient time to consult with an attorney. The agency has not provided sufficient justification for its failure to provide Appellants A and B with more time to consider whether to accept the proposed settlement agreements. The record also indicates that the agency would not negotiate the terms of the settlement agreements. Although Appellants A and B could have declined their respective settlement offers if they disagreed with any of the provisions, they stated that they believed that they were being "forced out" of the agency and that signing the settlement agreements was their only option other than eventual termination. Based on the circumstances here, we find that Appellants A and B were coerced into signing their respective settlement agreements and that, therefore, those settlement agreements are invalid<span class="Italic">. Cf. Coventry v. United States Steel Corp.</span>, 856 F.2d 514 (3d Cir. 1988) (determination of validity of waiver of rights under Age Discrimination in Employment Act must consider whether employee was able to negotiate and consult with an attorney); <span class="Italic">Paolillo v. Dresser Indus. Inc.</span>, 821 F.2d 81 (2d Cir. 1987) (where employee has only a "weekend" to decide whether to accept an early retirement plan, that time frame must be considered in determining whether acceptance was voluntary).</p>
<p class="noindent">Anyone who routinely represents parties in EEO hearings, be it for complainants or agencies, is all too familiar with the pressure administrative judges can exert on the parties to settle a case. Though this pressure seldom amounts to duress, in <span class="Italic">Mauro v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01952349 (1996), the Commission reviewed a set of circumstances involving an administrative judge that it said could amount to duress:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also wrote to the Administrative Judge who had presided over the meeting of August 24, 1994. In that letter, appellant stated</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I went to my hearing of 24 Aug. 94 with full expectation there would be a hearing on the merits to consider my case.... This didn't occur. Instead, extreme pressure was placed on me by everyone present to accept an offer of settlement which I violently disagreed with, as I had come for a hearing. Only after extreme pressure was placed on me by everyone present, I reluctantly signed the document in a highly emotional state, due to the unremitting pressure and badgering, and in particular threats by my union representative...<span id="Page_341"></span>to withdraw from my case and no longer represent me. I signed that agreement solely to make the pressure and duress go away. I never in my heart or in my mind agreed to the terms in that document.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant reiterates her claim that the settlement agreement was coerced. Appellant has also submitted the sworn statement of a witness to the settlement proceedings. This witness states that it was evident from the behavior of everyone present that no hearing would take place on appellant's EEO complaints. No court reporter had been scheduled to attend the hearing. Furthermore, the judge kept saying that she had an afternoon flight...and would like to have the hearing over by then to make her flight. She also said that the EEO Commission had no money left in the quarter to allow her to travel back for another hearing on these issues. [Appellant's representative] kept saying that she too could not return for another hearing because she was too busy, had a heavy case load, and too many other appointments.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission voided the settlement agreement on other grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the courts, there is careful scrutiny of claims that a Title VII plaintiff has waived his rights under duress and that the resulting settlement agreement is, therefore, not knowing and voluntary. Due to the strong public policy embodied by Title VII to eliminate discrimination, courts look at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the agreement and consider those circumstances, taking into account the actual individual involved. In <span class="Italic">Puentes v. United Parcel Service</span>, 86 F.3d 196, 198-200 (11th Cir. 1996), the court explained the several factors that go into that review:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employee knowingly and voluntarily releases an employer from liability for Title VII and 1981 claims with a full understanding of the terms of the agreement, he is bound by that agreement<span class="Italic">. E.g., Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36, 52 &#x0026; n.15, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 1021 &#x0026; n.15, 39 L. Ed.2d 147 (1974); <span class="Italic">Freeman v. Motor Convoy, Inc.</span>, 700 F.2d 1339, 1352 (11th Cir. 1983). However, the waiver of such remedial rights must be closely scrutinized<span class="Italic">. Freeman</span>, 700 F.2d at 13 52; <span class="Italic">see also Coventry v. United States Steel Corp.</span>, 856 F.2d 514, 522-23 (3d Cir. 1988) ("In light of the strong policy concerns to eradicate discrimination in employment, a review of the totality of the circumstances, considerate of the particular individual who has executed the release, is also necessary.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a release was knowingly and voluntarily executed, courts look to the totality of the circumstances. Factors that guide a court include:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the plaintiff's education and business experience; the amount of time the plaintiff considered the agreement before signing it; the clarity of the agreement; the plaintiff's opportunity to consult with an attorney; the employer's encouragement or discouragement of consultation with an attorney; and the consideration given in exchange for the waiver when compared with the benefits to which the employee was already entitled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Beadle v. City of Tampa</span>, 42 F.3d 633, 635 (11th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 2600, 132 L. Ed.2d 846 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Gormin v. Brown-Forman Corp.</span>, 963 F.2d 323, 327 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs do not seriously contest that they each had sufficient business experience to evaluate the releases they were asked to sign, nor do they contest the clarity of the release language. Moreover, we agree with the district court that the consideration given in exchange for the waiver exceeds the benefits to which the plaintiffs were already entitled. That leaves as the plaintiffs' principal assertions that they were not given adequate time to consider the agreement, and that they were not given a fair opportunity to consult an attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no bright-line test for determining what is a sufficient amount of time for an employee to consider a release and consult with an attorney before the employee is considered to have signed the release knowingly and voluntarily<span class="Italic">. See Carroll v. Primerica Fin. Servs. Ins. Mktg.</span>, 811 F. Supp. 1558, 1566 (N.D. Ga. 1992) (holding that "there is a question as to whether Holt was given three full days or less than one day to sign her release," and that "[i]f she was given only one, then there is indeed a genuine issue as to whether she was given sufficient time"); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. American Express Publishing. Corp.</span>, 681 F. Supp. 216, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (finding that "[t]hree days, while not conclusive as to involuntariness, is sufficiently short to create a question on the subject [for summary judgment purposes"); <span class="Italic">Constant v. Continental Tel. Co.</span>, 745 F. Supp. 1374, 1382 (C.D. Ill. 1990) (finding that time period between the Friday upon which the employee received the release form and the Tuesday by which he was required to sign it was adequate time, in light of fact that during that "relatively short time," the employee was able to obtain legal advice with which he was apparently satisfied); <span class="Italic">Mullen v. New Jersey Steel Corp.</span>, 733 F. Supp. 1534, 1544-45 (D.N.J. 1990) (finding that employee's signing of release was knowing and voluntary when he had fourteen days to consider the release); <span class="Italic">Pears v. Spang</span>, 718 F. Supp. 441, 446 (W.D. Pa. 1989) (finding that the fact that the employee signed the release within "several days" did not make her signing unknowing or involuntary, in light of fact that the employer had not set a deadline by which the employee was required to sign the release). However, the cases seem to indicate, and we conclude, that absent some reason for urgency, twenty-four hours is too short a period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, plaintiffs have given sworn testimony that they were only given twenty-four hours to decide whether to sign the releases, and that they understood that the offer would not be valid longer than that. UPS denies that it imposed a twenty-four hour time limitation upon the plaintiffs, but that is an issue to be decided by a jury. Plaintiff Ginart testified in his deposition that Saunders, the UPS manager terminating him, said, "I will give you 24 hours to make your decision and I will be waiting for your call as to whether or not you are going to be signing the release form or not." Saunders testified to the contrary, that he placed no time limit on Ginart, that he did not schedule another meeting or set any deadline when he and Ginart concluded their first discussion of the severance package, and that Ginart took all initiative to call him up the following morning to say that he had decided to sign the release form.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, Plaintiff Balsinde testified that Stevens, the UPS manager terminating him, told him to contact him the following morning to let him know whether he would sign the release form. Stevens testified that he did tell Balsinde that "if he wanted me involved with anything with regards to his resignation, that I would be leaving by the end of the next day and that he could call me, but he was free to call us any time that he wanted to call us."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If in fact the plaintiffs were only given twenty-four hours to decide whether to sign the releases, that was insufficient time. It is undisputed that neither plaintiff consulted with an attorney before signing the releases, and a twenty-four hour time limitation would have substantially impeded their ability to do so. Indeed, when pressed at oral argument, UPS's attorney could offer no justification for such a short time period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, as we must, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Matsushita Electric</span>, 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S. Ct. at 1356, means that "what we state as "facts' in this opinion for purposes of reviewing the rulings on the summary judgment motions may not be the actual facts. They are however, the facts for present purposes." <span class="Italic">Swint v. City of Wadley</span>, 51 F.3d 988, 992 (11th Cir. 1995). With those caveats, what we must consider as the facts for present purposes are that the plaintiffs were given only twenty-four hours to decide whether they would sign the releases and accept the severance packages. Additionally, the plaintiffs had no role in deciding the terms of the releases. None of the terms of the release were negotiated. The plaintiffs were simply handed a printed form. Ginart requested to take a copy of the release form home overnight to think about it, and was told that he could not take the form out of the UPS office, because it was a UPS document and UPS property. There is no good reason why UPS could not provide Ginart a copy of the release form that it was asking him to voluntarily and knowingly sign. That, like a 24-hour time constraint, could have been motivated by a desire to impede the employee's ability to consult with an attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These factors, particularly when inferences are drawn in the plaintiffs' favor, as is required on a motion for summary judgment, raise a genuine issue of material fact about whether the plaintiffs voluntarily and knowingly executed the releases. In other words, the evidence in this case is such that a factfinder could find that the plaintiffs did not knowingly and voluntarily execute the releases. Accordingly, that issue may not be resolved by summary judgment<span class="Italic">. See</span> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant presents evidence that she was not mentally capable of entering into an agreement, the agreement may be set aside. In <span class="Italic">Merholtz v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01955235 (1996), the Commission found the settlement agreement was void because the complainant submitted a neuropsychological report and a statement from her psychiatrist, indicating that during the period the settlement agreement was signed, the complainant's cognitive capacity was diminished; she was suffering from severe depression; she was taking many medications that could have adversely affected her ability to concentrate; and she was suicidal. As an example of her concentration difficulties, the neuropsychological report noted that complainant admitted that during the relevant period she missed an $18,000,000 gift while auditing a tax return. The complainant also submitted an affidavit stating that the many medications she was taking impaired her ability to think clearly. She stated that the EEO director told her to sign the settlement agreement and that she did so without reading it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant has engaged in other legal transactions during the relevant time period does not mean, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, that she was competent to knowingly enter into a settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Navy,</span> 01956624 (1996), the Commission found the agency failed to prove the other legal transactions had the same complexity, and in light of the medical evidence, found the complainant was not competent to knowingly enter the settlement agreement. What is surprising about <span class="Italic">Williams</span> is the Commission's finding that the agency bears the burden of demonstrating that the other transactions were equally complex. Of course, prior to considering that issue, the Commission had already considered the medical evidence and found sufficient grounds for finding the complainant was not competent. It could be that to the extent the legal transactions were offered as a defense, the burden is placed on the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_342"></span>The Commission's review of the entire record leads the Commission to conclude that appellant's mental state on January 4, 1994 was of such a nature that she did not knowingly enter the settlement agreement. The Commission is particularly convinced by Psychiatrist A's November 6, 1995 letter describing appellant's mental state at the time when she entered the agreement. Psychiatrist A was appellant's treating psychiatrist during the relevant time frame. Psychiatrist A specifically stated that appellant was "severely impaired intellectually and emotionally...[was] severely depressed, fearful of everyone she dealt with, and clearly dysfunctional enough to interfere with her mental competence." The Commission finds Psychiatrist B's statements less important than Psychiatrist A's statements because Psychiatrist B was not appellant's treating Psychiatrist until June 1994. Nevertheless, we find that Psychiatrist B's October 31, 1995 letter corroborates the observations and conclusions rendered by Psychiatrist A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency's reference to other legal transactions undertaken by appellant does not show in this case that appellant entered the settlement agreement knowingly. The agency argues that the only legal transaction appellant is challenging is the EEO settlement agreement, but the record is silent as to whether appellant feels she was competent to obtain a divorce, resume use of her maiden name, apply for welfare benefits, apply for workmen's compensation benefits, and obtain the services of attorneys. The Commission finds that these legal actions cited by the agency, by themselves or examined collectively, fail to indicate that appellant had the capacity to understand the settlement agreement. The agency has not shown that these actions have a complexity equal to or greater than that involved in reaching the instant EEO settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that because of appellant's mental state, appellant did not enter the January 1994 settlement agreement knowingly. The agency shall give appellant the option of: (1) having the settled complaint reinstated from the point processing ceased; or (2) ratifying the agreement in writing and therefore creating a binding agreement. Because of our disposition, we do not address appellant's other arguments in support of reinstatement of the settled complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Rhea v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121476 (2013), the Commission rejected the arguments of the complainant that he was not competent to sign a settlement reached during a hearing on the case. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rhea</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we address Complainant's claim that he was medically incapacitated on October 19, 2011, and thus, incapable of entering into the settlement agreement. The record indicates Complainant testified for several hours at the hearing on his complaint which was the same day he signed the settlement agreement. In addition, we note a review of the hearing transcript for October 19, 2011, does not indicate from Complainant, the Agency representatives, or the AJ that Complainant lacked the capacity to proceed. We also note that Complainant presented no medical evidence indicating he was medically incapacitated on the date at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, a review of the record contains an affidavit from the Agency Attorney and Agency Co-Counsel who both state that they did not notice Complainant suffering from any of the cited conditions on the morning of the hearing. The Agency Attorney stated that Complainant appeared very lucid, was able to recite every aspect of his case, and managed to answer all of the questions posed to him without any difficulty. The Agency Attorney noted that Complainant asked several questions regarding specific terms in the agreement to which she answered each of his questions. Agency Co-Counsel noted that Complainant refused to accept the initial offer that the Agency Attorney made him and negotiated for a better deal. She noted that Complainant negotiated so strongly, that she and the Agency Attorney had to take a break from the discussion to request more authority from the client. She also noted that Complainant asked specific questions about provisions in the agreement. Upon review, we find Complainant did not show that he lacked the capacity to enter into the subject settlement agreement on October 19, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject Complainant's argument that the settlement agreement lacked consideration. We note that the agreement, the Agency agreed to pay Complainant $7,500, restore 150 hours of annual leave, convert AWOL from January 2010 to February 2011 to LWOP, and give Complainant a third wing to his case, all of which constituted valid consideration. Complainant appears to be unhappy with the amount of consideration he received; however, this does not change the fact that there was valid consideration in the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note Complainant also claimed that he was not given reasonable time for his wife to review the agreement or for him to consult an attorney. However, we note that Complainant was not represented by an attorney or his wife at the time of the hearing. We find the Complainant had adequate time to consider the agreement before signing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that since Complainant elected to settle his complaint, he is precluded from challenging the AJ's actions regarding the processing of his complaint during the October 19, 2011 hearing. Moreover, we find no evidence that the AJ coerced Complainant into signing the agreement.</p>
