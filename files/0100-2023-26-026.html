<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-27"><span class="space">P.</span> REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUESTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">A request for reasonable accommodation is protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120113118 (2014). When a complaint of reprisal is based on making a request for accommodation as the protected activity, the complainant is not required to demonstrate that he or she is a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Keller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03119 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">Rather, the complainant need only show a reasonable belief that he or she was covered by the Rehabilitation Act, as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Henry S. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720170020 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that Complainant's 2011 requests for reassignment to accommodate his disability do not constitute protected activity because he was not covered by the Rehabilitation Act as a uniformed servicemember. However, with regard to reprisal discrimination, the Commission has stated that the anti-reprisal provision of Title VII protects not only those who participate in the EEO process, but also those who oppose discriminatory employment practices; requesting a reasonable accommodation constitutes opposition to a discriminatory employment practice. In addition, the Commission has recognized that requesting reasonable accommodation for a disability can constitute protected opposition activity. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.004 (Aug. 25, 2016) at II(A)(2). "A variety of activities has been found to constitute opposition.... Because the enforcement of Title VII depends on the willingness of employees to oppose unlawful employment practices or policies, courts have interpreted section 704(a) of Title VII as intending to provide 'exceptionally broad protection to those who oppose such practices.'" <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120123074 (Jan. 7, 2013) (citations omitted). We note that Title VII protects a person "where the employee has a reasonable, good faith belief that the challenged employment practice violates Title VII, even if the belief is later found to be mistaken.... The mistaken belief may be one of law or of fact." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">quoting Wolf v. J.I. Case Co</span>., 617 F. Supp. 858, 868 (E.D. Wis. 1985). A complainant's burden under this standard has both a subjective and objective component. <span class="Italic">Knight v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01956704 (Jan. 5, 1998), <span class="Italic">citing Little v. United Technologies</span>, 103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir. 1997). The complainant must not only show that he subjectively, that is, in good faith, believed that his employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices, but also that his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the facts and record presented. It thus is not enough for a complainant to allege that his belief in this regard was honest and <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, the allegations and record must also indicate that the belief, though perhaps mistaken, was objectively reasonable. <span class="Italic">Stevens</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120123074.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant's belief that he requested reasonable accommodation and was protected by the Rehabilitation Act in 2011 was reasonable under the circumstances presented herein. Further, there is no basis to doubt the good-faith nature of Complainant's mistaken belief. Specifically, Complainant, who had an identified disability requested a flexible schedule to accommodate medical appointments and to be transferred away from stressors that aggravated his PTSD. S1 subsequently granted the request for a flexible schedule and the request for a transfer. Therefore, it was reasonable and a good-faith belief for Complainant to believe that he had requested reasonable accommodation and was protected under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the protected activity is requesting accommodation and the complainant alleges reprisal, the analysis is the same as for other reprisal cases involving circumstantial evidence as demonstrated in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120121339 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant engaged in protected activity when she expressed a need for reasonable accommodation on more than one occasion. Specifically, in March/April 2007, Complainant asked to be permanently reassigned to the Administrative Building because it had nearby access to a bathroom, computer printer, and a handicapped parking space. Complainant also felt that working in ICRC was not suited to her disability and asked to be moved. By asking for reassignment due to her disability, Complainant clearly was asking for a reasonable accommodation. Because Complainant's disability affects her mobility and fine motor skills, it is apparent that Complainant needed continuous accommodation while working as a Security Specialist, of which the Agency was clearly aware. According to Complainant, the Agency had provided her with reasonable accommodation as a Security Specialist, requiring that she perform only three functions of the position. While continuously needing accommodation, management gave Complainant Unacceptable ratings, placed her on two PIPs, reassigned her, and terminated her. The record reflects that the Agency's subsequent termination of Complainant for poor performance metrics was directly related to her need for accommodation. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, we now turn to the Agency's burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. S1 elaborated that the reason Complainant was given Unacceptable ratings and put on PIPs was because she had difficulty understanding and performing the most basic functions of her position. S1 also averred that Complainant was rude and short-tempered with coworkers and visitors to the Agency. S1 further averred that he assigned Complainant to the lobby area of the ICRC because he felt the position would accommodate Complainant. However, according to S1, while assigned to the lobby, Complainant became disruptive and complained to employees and visitors about the assignment. S1 also stated that, after Complainant's first PIP was overturned, it was decided to place Complainant on another PIP because her work did not improve and she continued to display hostile and rude behavior in the workplace. Further, the AUC explained that the RMD decided to reassign Complainant to DocLab for a 90-day trial period in order to give her another chance to perform successfully. The AUC explained that Complainant nevertheless could not meet the necessary metric standards as an RCT by the end of the trial period. This explanation is sufficient to meet the Agency's burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ultimately prevail, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 143; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 519. We find that Complainant clearly has done so in the present case, and that the Agency erred in finding otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we find that Complainant has established that the Agency's reasons for her PIPs and subsequent termination were pretext for discrimination based on reprisal. The record reflects that management was unhappy with Complainant's need for accommodations and the way she voiced concerns concerning her disability. The Agency was also clearly not pleased with Complainant's attempt to pursue accommodation for her disability legally. In particular, the AD stated that Complainant engaged in a number of disruptive behaviors, including working on legal matters against the Agency during the workday and drawing other employees into her legal matters. ROI, Ex. 181, at 2-3. The AD also averred in the record:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On one occasion, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller made an official visit to RMD, and [Complainant] inappropriately called out to him in a public forum to express her personal complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record reflects that S1 was clearly not satisfied with reassigning Complainant away from the ICRC lobby area, asserting that she (Complainant) engaged in disruptive behavior while assigned there. Shortly thereafter, S1 gave Complainant a rating of Unacceptable and Complainant was placed on a PIP. After the PIP and Unacceptable rating were overturned, S1 tried again, giving Complainant another Unacceptable rating, thereby placing Complainant on a second PIP. According to Complainant, the second PIP required her to perform all of the duties of a Security Specialist without regard to her accommodations. Complainant noted that the PIP did not reflect the accommodations that had been previously provided for her. The Agency subsequently threatened Complainant with termination, asserting that she failed to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the second PIP. Rather than immediately terminating her, management assigned Complainant to a 90-day trial assignment as an RCT. Therein, at the conclusion of the 90-day period, the AUC asserted that Complainant did not meet the required metrics of the RCT position, and thereafter management proceeded with Complainant's termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we note that the ASC bluntly disagreed with AUC's assessment of Complainant's performance and felt that Complainant should not have been terminated. ROI, Ex. 18E. The ASC also averred that she experienced negative consequences for her support in giving Complainant a chance in DocLab. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5. The ASC further stated that on October 1, 2009, she was told that the AD found her judgment to be poor in giving Complainant a chance in DocLab. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ASC also stated that, due to her support of Complainant, she uncharacteristically began to be left off e-mail and verbal updates regarding Complainant's progress. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ASC believed that Complainant's performance metrics were not being evaluated fairly. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ASC averred as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Based on an e-mail that was sent on August 19th regarding [Complainant's] performance metrics, I determined that [Complainant] was being given only Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) files to work on. I became concerned that a fair representation of Complainant's metrics would not be portrayed, since FOIA assignments are much more difficult and time consuming than other types of work. Serial numbers have to be traced over, copies have to be made of brittle onion skin paper, orders of pages reversed <span id="Page_1483"></span>or correct.... Experienced staff have had difficulty meeting metric standards when given FOIA material alone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ASC continued saying that, even though Complainant did not have sufficient training for performing DocLab work, Complainant was very close to meeting metric standards. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8. Specifically, the ASC averred:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I determined that [Complainant] only had a few hours of reassembly process time and training, which would not be sufficient assess whether she could ultimately meet the quota. Seasoned employees have a difficult time meeting the reassembly quota. I do not believe we would terminate anyone else in DocLab for exhibiting the same performance level as [Complainant] during her short trial time in DocLab. ...I see no reason to believe Complainant's attitude was a problem in DocLab (Emphasis Added),</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8-9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that management later presented the ASC with an EC requiring her signature. The EC noted that Complainant would be terminated for failing to meet the required metric standards of an RCT. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9. According to the ASC, she resisted signing the EC because she felt that Complainant had not been given a fair chance, and therefore she met with management about the issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therein, the AUC reportedly stated to the ASC that management "was under no obligation to give [Complainant] a chance in DocLab in the first place." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10. The ASC averred that she felt pressured to sign the EC, stating that she signed the EC under duress. The ASC also averred that a coworker told her that "things would not be pretty for me if I didn't sign it." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency's decision discredited the ASC's affidavit, asserting that no other witnesses confirmed her statements. On the contrary, we find that the ASC's and Complainant's statements corroborate each other, noting that she (Complainant) "had a lot of the more difficult assignments and was given many of the older, more physically fragile files." ROI, Ex. 9A, at 10. We see no reason in the record to discredit the ASC's affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's reasons for Complainant's termination to be unworthy of belief and a pretext for reprisal for Complainant's requests for accommodation. We note that the Supreme Court has held that the fact-finder may find pretext where he or she determines that the Agency's articulated reason is unworthy of belief. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 133. As such, based on the above, we find that Complainant has presented credible evidence to establish that the Agency's nondiscriminatory reasons are unworthy of belief. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established that she was subjected to discrimination based on reprisal.</p>
