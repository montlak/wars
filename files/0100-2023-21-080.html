<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-87"><span class="space">1.</span> Prompt and Effective Corrective Action</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has given a strict, plain language meaning to the requirement that an agency take prompt and effective remedial action when it receives a complaint of harassment or otherwise becomes aware that harassment might be occurring. An agency must promptly investigate any claim of harassment and be prepared to act immediately if it appears to have merit. For example, in <span class="Italic">Crane v. Postmaster General,</span> 01924585 (1993), the Commission found that the agency had not taken immediate and effective action to prevent further harassment when it failed to take the complainant's allegations seriously and conduct a prompt investigation. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Crane</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching its decision, the Commission places great emphasis on the failure of the agency, specifically the SPO, to act when appellant first brought her allegations to his attention in 1989. Whenever an allegation of a hostile environment is brought to the attention of an employer, it has a duty to investigate such complaints and to take action against the offending supervisor if the complaint is found to be meritorious. <span class="Italic">Garziano v. E.I. Dupont de Nemour &#x0026; Co.</span>, 818 F.2d 380 (5th Cir. 1987). The failure of agency officials to conduct a viable investigation, and to take prompt remedial action, is an important component in establishing liability. The content of the SPO's testimony clearly indicates that he did not believe appellant's allegations when they were brought to his attention in 1989. In addition, the Commission does not find credible, in light of the rest of the evidence, the SPO's assertion that appellant did not state and he did not understand her allegation to be one of sexual harassment. In fact, the AJ found that the SPO was clearly trying to hide something. The Commission agrees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains no evidence that appellant's allegations were taken seriously or that any type of viable, thorough investigation was conducted in 1989 or at any other time. In fact, the failure of the SPO to act, despite the fact that he had sufficient information to be aware that some type of problem existed, allowed the harassment to resume in 1991. The SPO not only failed to investigate appellant's allegations, he only transferred Supervisor 1 for six weeks and then promptly put him back into a supervisory position over appellant. These actions were clearly inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the record contains unrebutted statements of Witness 3 that as a result of her 1989 allegations, the Postmaster was intending to transfer appellant to another facility. The record does not rebut appellant's assertions that the Postmaster indicated to her in 1991 that she would have to leave if she did not want to be subjected to Supervisor 1. In conclusion, the record as a whole shows no attempt by the agency to pursue appellant's allegations in a responsible and appropriate manner, either in 1988-89 or 1991. The agency's actions were clearly in violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has not issued any bright-line rules for how long an agency has to take prompt and effective remedial action. Depending on the circumstances, however, the time period could be exceptionally short. For example, in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01941973 (1996), the Commission found the agency had not taken prompt and effective remedial action where three weeks after her initial complaint, the complainant was forced to take the matter to the agency inspector general. The Commission noted that in those three weeks, the supervisor to which the complainant brought her allegations informed the alleged harasser and met with him to discuss ways to discipline the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the agency ultimately responds to the complaint of harassment does not mean that it took prompt and effective remedial action. If earlier attempts by the complainant to have the harassment remedied were ignored, liability may ensue. In <span class="Italic">Ulloa</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While recognizing that the Field Director of Human Resources responded to complainant's August 30, 1989, hostile environment allegations to the Postmaster, the AJ found that these rumors developed and persisted, in part, from S1's improper conduct and from the failure of other supervisors to take prompt and effective action under the circumstances to investigate or remedy the situation prior to the agency's response by the Postmaster.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commission case law indicates that an agency must be exceptionally vigilant in its efforts to eradicate harassment from the workplace. In <span class="Italic">Voigt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931799 (1994), the Commission held that an agency must do "whatever is necessary" to bring an end to the harassment, make the victim whole, and prevent further harassment from occurring. An agency's obligation does not extend only to those cases where it has determined that sexual harassment actually occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Voigt</span>, the complainant alleged that she was being sexually harassed by a coworker with whom she previously had a romantic relationship. The <span id="Page_872"></span>complainant alleged that the coworker, after the end of the relationship, made derogatory comments to her, placed sexually explicit graffiti on the bathroom walls, and left her two sexually explicit notes. The coworker vigorously denied the allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency did make some efforts to determine the source of the harassment. It also immediately washed graffiti from the bathroom walls when it appeared, and ultimately issued a letter to all employees advising that anyone caught placing graffiti on the walls would be disciplined, up to and including removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission in <span class="Italic">Voigt</span> remanded the case because the record was unclear as to some of the actions taken by the agency and the dates they were taken, it did give extensive guidance about the nature of agency corrective actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the employer has actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged hostile environment sexual harassment, but fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action, the employer is liable. <span class="Italic">See Barrett v. Omaha National Bank</span>, 584 F. Supp. 22, 30-31 (D. Neb. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 726 F.2d 424 (8th Cir. 1984). The Commission in its Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, Notice N-915-050 (March 19, 1990) characterizes such action as that which does whatever is necessary to end the harassment, makes the victim whole by restoring lost employment benefits or opportunities, and prevents the misconduct from recurring. Part of the employer's duty is also to promptly investigate harassment claims<span class="Italic">. Munford v. James T. Barnes &#x0026; Co.</span>, 441 F. Supp. 459, 466 (E.D. Mich. 1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the graffiti and the sexually derogatory notes were of a sexual nature and were offensive to appellant. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Corroon &#x0026; Black Corp.</span>, 845 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. 1988) (obscene cartoons in the men's room depicting plaintiff). The graffiti appeared continuously and therefore was sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile working environment. At the hearing, the agency appeared to take the position that appellant was not the victim of sexual harassment because the graffiti depicted many other employees as well as appellant. However, that fact does not detract from its relevance in determining whether an environment is a hostile one<span class="Italic">. Waltman v. International Paper Co.</span>, 875 F.2d 468, 477 (5th Cir. 1989). In addition, the sexually explicit notes were, as described by the AJ, "disgraceful, depraved and puerile." Arguably, they were severe enough standing alone to create a hostile environment for appellant; certainly combined with the graffiti they demonstrate the existence of a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the agency was aware of the graffiti and was made aware, by appellant, of the notes. The question thus becomes whether the agency took the requisite action to correct the situation. We have concluded that although the record shows some appropriate actions, the record is too incomplete and ambiguous to permit any findings that the agency satisfied its duty to take all immediate and appropriate corrective actions. A complicating factor in this case is that the agency did not know who drew the graffiti or sent the notes. The agency did make some attempts to find out who was responsible, on dates not provided in the record, but was unsuccessful. Regarding the graffiti, the Postmaster also properly conducted a stand-up talk and issued a letter in the spring of 1989, which was successful for a few months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, following these admonitions by the Postmaster, the graffiti began again. According to the SPO, about six months after her arrival at the Cupertino facility, which would be approximately October 1989, she was informed of sexually offensive graffiti on the bathroom walls. It is at this point that the record fails to document whether further corrective actions were taken. Appellant and her husband testified that the graffiti appeared from 1989 to 1991. Agency witnesses did not dispute this assertion and indeed, it is corroborated by the testimony of the SPO, who testified that the graffiti lasted a "long time." The record does not tell us the dates on which the graffiti appeared, or the frequency. In terms of corrective actions by the agency from October 1989 on, the record shows only that the graffiti was washed off immediately each time it appeared. Although testimony indicates that the Inspection Service was contacted some time in 1990 or 1991 about the graffiti, it apparently was not the sexually offensive nature of the graffiti but the death threat that prompted the contact. Moreover, the record does not show that the Inspection Service questioned Employee 1 or any other employees regarding any of the graffiti. Nor does it show what, if any, actions were taken by Cupertino management after the Inspection Service was unable to identify the person making the graffiti. For example, although the Postmaster and appellant's supervisor both stated that they repeatedly questioned Employee 1, the record does not make clear whether any of the questioning after October 1989 pertained to the graffiti. There is also no indication in the record that the agency questioned other employees about the graffiti.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without more definitive information regarding agency efforts after October 1989, we cannot make any findings on the adequacy of the efforts. Appellant, as well as the other employees depicted in the graffiti, have a "right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult." <span class="Italic">Vinson, supra</span>, 477 U.S. at 64 (discussing the EEOC's position regarding hostile environment sexual harassment). This right places on the agency an affirmative duty to investigate acts of sexual harassment and to deal appropriately with the offending personnel<span class="Italic">. See Munford, supra</span>. As we stated above, it is Commission policy that an employer must do whatever is necessary to end the harassment, make the victim whole, and prevent the harassment from continuing. The Commission finds that there is insufficient information in the record to determine whether the agency took appropriate corrective action with regard to the graffiti. Agency officials in their affidavits and testimony generally spoke in terms of their responses to appellant's complaints to them, without giving the dates of the complaints or the dates of their actions, and without differentiating among the issues. Therefore, the question of adequate remedial action on the matter of the graffiti must be remanded for more complete information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the offensive notes, appellant's testimony indicated that the two notes appeared at the same time. Although the record indicates that some action was taken with respect to this matter and that no further notes were received, we decline to make any finding regarding the agency's actions on this matter at this time in light of the need to remand the issue of the graffiti for further investigation. Likewise, because it will be necessary for us to consider the situation as a whole, we do not make any findings with respect to the agency's actions on the remaining acts involving adverse comments made by Employee 1 to appellant and to others about appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission finds that as to the graffiti that appeared in the workplace from 1989 to 1991, a remand for a supplemental investigation is necessary. The Commission declines, at this time, to make findings on the other matters.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether an agency has taken prompt remedial action is a question of fact that goes to the merits of the case. An allegation of hostile environment states a claim regardless of whether the agency asserts that prompt remedial action was taken. As a result, the claim must be investigated. As the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Steffe v. Secretary of Navy,</span> 01963487 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, appellant alleges in his complaint that the agency permitted a hostile work environment to exist when male employees changed their work clothes in rooms or areas frequented by female employees. Construing appellant's complaint in a light favorable to her, we find that this allegation states a claim of adverse treatment sufficient to warrant an investigation of the merits. We further find that the basis for the agency's decision to dismiss this allegation, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that it took prompt action to address appellant's contention and that she thus was not aggrieved, more properly focuses on the merits of appellant's allegation, and not on whether she stated a claim for relief. While appellant ultimately will have to prove that the agency allowed a hostile environment to exist when male employees changed their clothes in non-private locations, her ability or inability to meet that burden is irrelevant to whether this allegation stated a justiciable Title VII claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a victim of alleged sexual harassment initiates EEO counseling does not absolve management of its obligation to investigate accusations of sexual harassment. The agency is required to investigate and take prompt and effective corrective action, irrespective of any complaint activity. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922440 (1994). As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Tom v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01966875 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that it was not until the EEO counselor had conducted its investigation, and the counselor's report was all but completed, that agency management officials took the additional action of separating the parties and removing the LC from the department on March 4, 1994, and ultimately, suspending the LC for ten days in June of 1994. The agency's response to appellant's allegations, as indicated by S1 and the FBC, was wholly inadequate when it was again faced with allegations of sexual harassment by the same perpetrator. The circumstances here required the agency to immediately separate the parties, and commence an investigation as to whether or not there was sufficient evidence to corroborate appellant's allegations, and warrant disciplinary action and EEO sensitivity training for the alleged harasser. The responsibility of agency management officials to investigate charges of sexual harassment is independent of the EEO complaint process, and cannot be delegated to an EEO counselor, who him or herself may have a backlog of EEO complaints to investigate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the agency's reliance on the fact that appellant did not provide a written statement to S1 or the FBC, as a basis to justify their inaction with respect to appellant's allegations of sexual harassment, is also misplaced. While we recognize that a written statement from an alleged victim could help clarify potentially complex issues of fact, and may add credibility to her allegations, especially if notes were kept contemporaneous with the acts of alleged sexual harassment, the absence of a written statement from the alleged victim does not preclude agency management officials from taking immediate and prompt steps to investigate such charges or exonerate the agency from liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_873"></span>While appellant did not indicate that she refused to provide a written statement, neither did she confirm that S1 or FBC requested such a written statement. The Commission notes that appellant did provide written statements to the EEO counselor and the EEO investigator. The Commission also notes that during the EEO Complaint processing stage, our Regulations provide that an appellant's refusal to provide a written statement may, under certain limited circumstances, be grounds for the dismissal of an EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(g). In contrast, when an agency investigates a charge of sexual harassment, Commission guidelines provide that those charged with investigating charges of sexual harassment should obtain specific detail respecting the conduct alleged to have occurred. No requirement exists that the form of the detail respecting the conduct must be provided in a written statement from the appellant<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, N-915-050, No. 137 (March 19, 1990). Where, as here, an alleged victim does not provide a written statement to a supervisor, a supervisor should, and S1 or the FBC could have, taken sufficient written notes of his conversation with appellant so as to enable him, or another agency official, to investigate her allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Trey M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120180781 (2019), conducting inquiries into the alleged harassing behavior and referring the alleged harasser to EAP did not qualify as appropriate corrective action.</p>
