<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-119"><span class="space">B.</span> INTERSECTION OF TWO OR MORE PROTECTED BASES</h3>
<p class="noindent">EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 15, "Race and Color Discrimination," No. 915.003, at 15-8 (2006), addresses intersectional discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII prohibits discrimination not just because of one protected <span id="Page_924"></span>trait (e.g., race), but also because of the intersection of two or more protected bases (e.g., race and sex). For example, Title VII prohibits discrimination against African American women even if the employer does not discriminate against White women or African American men. Likewise, Title VII protects Asian American women from discrimination based on stereotypes and assumptions about them "even in the absence of discrimination against Asian American men or White women." The law also prohibits individuals from being subjected to discrimination because of the intersection of their race and a trait covered by another EEO statute--e.g., race and disability, or race and age.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Marleen G. v. Attorney General</span>, 2019003172 (2020), considered the intersection of the complainant's race and sex in the context of the alleged incidents of harassment to find the agency liable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue in this case is whether Complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment based on her race, sex, age, and reprisal. Complainant's race is Black, her sex is female, her age is over 40 years old, and she engaged in prior protected EEO activity. Therefore, Complainant has established her membership in statutorily protected classes. Further, Complainant indicated that she was subjected to unwelcome, abusive behavior by S1 in the form of screaming, cursing, and berating. Complainant further averred that she was subjected to unwelcome physical conduct by S1 on two occasions. Complainant has satisfied the second prong.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third prong requires Complainant establish a connection between the unwelcome conduct and her protected bases. Complainant alleged that S1 told her that she seemed to lack "good common sense" and attributed the same to Complainant's "culture." Complainant stated that S1's comments about her intelligence compared her to someone, "who is mentally challenged (retarded) which [she found] highly offensive having raised a child who is mentally challenged with severe disabilities." Complainant stated that S1's language was offensive and unwelcome. Further, the depiction of Black people as less intelligent is a significant trope with an extensive history. <span class="Italic">See e.g. Almon v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC DOC 0720090023 (Feb. 9, 2011) (stating that terms used by coworkers about complainant were derived from a long, history of portraying African-Americans as subhuman or inferior).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that S1 discussed with her the improbability of a romantic/sexual relationship between Complainant and RN2, Complainant's subordinate. S1 found the relationship to be unlikely, not because Complainant is RN2's supervisor, but because RN1 is a White man and Complainant is a Black woman. S1's focus on Complainant and RN2's races further demonstrated S1's focus on Complainant's race. S1 also commented on the "ridiculousness" of weaves worn by African-American women. The criticism of African-American women's hair also has a significant history, and this commentary has often been used in the pejorative. <span class="Italic">See Atkins v. LQ Management, LLC</span>, 138 F. Supp.3d 961 (Sept. 30, 2015) <span class="Italic">citing Williams v. CSX Transp. Co</span>., 533 Fed. Appx. 637, 641 (6th Cir. 2013) (stating that, "While some of the comments may have been misguided attempts at humor, others were downright offensive, and all were unwelcome"). That same criticism is intrinsically linked to race and sex, the intersection of the two being usually subjected to heightened scrutiny other races or sexes may not be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also reported S1 calling her and another Black female "uppity." We have previously acknowledged the term "uppity" may have a racial connotation. <span class="Italic">See generally, Elise S. v. Dep't. of Def</span>., Appeal No. 0120171072 (July 13, 2018). S1 denied Complainant's allegations. S1 stated that everything between them was fine in March 2017, and claimed she never verbally assaulted Complainant. However, others corroborated elements of Complainant's allegations, including RN2 who stated that he witnessed S1 chasing Complainant and screaming and cursing at her. CE1 attested to witnessing S1 screaming at Complainant, and hearing Complainant crying. RN1 also attested to hearing S1 scream at Complainant through the office. Therefore, we find Complainant's version of events to be more reliable. When S1's use of the word "uppity" is coupled with other statements, including questioning Complainant's intelligence by stating her lack of common sense must be "cultural," stating that a relationship between Complainant and RN1 was unlikely because of their races, and categorizing weaves worn by African-American women as "ridiculous," we find that this casts the word's use in an offensive light.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also consider how S1's treatment of Complainant also seemed to be based on the intersection of Complainant's race and sex. "Title VII prohibits discrimination not just because of one protected trait (e.g., race), but also because of the intersection of two or more protected bases (e.g., race and sex)." EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 15, "Race and Color Discrimination," No. 915.003, at 15-4 (April 19, 2006). Complainant alleged that S1 told her to "grow some big balls," commented on Black women wearing weaves and looking ridiculous in doing so, boasted about being strong enough to be in the "good ole [sic] boys club," and referring to another Black/West Indian woman as "uppity" and "prideful." These comments demonstrate an intersection of discriminatory animus based on Complainant's race and sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are required to examine Complainant's allegations from a reasonable person in the position of the person claiming injury. Several of the witness statements supported Complainant's version of the events, while no witnesses corroborated S1's version.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are also required to consider the allegations in their totality, and in doing so, we find that S1 was motivated by racial animus in her treatment of Complainant. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established a connection to her protected classes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the fourth prong, Complainant was twice reassigned from FCI to Camp, and was once reported as AWOL by S1. The record shows that S1 reported Complainant as AWOL and afterwards admitted to wrongfully doing so. While S1 rescinded this action, Complainant alleged that S1 threatened her with this action and S1 seemingly only rescinded it in the face of the action being deemed erroneous. The record established that Complainant was reassigned while her allegations against S1 were being investigated. Complainant also averred that S1 interfered with Complainant's duties or removed her duties. Complainant's allegation of S1 removing duties is corroborated by RN1, who stated that S1 told her not to report to Complainant, even though Complainant was RN1's first-line supervisor. Complainant also alleged that S1 removed her from the schedule, and removed her from the SHU list for rounds. These actions demonstrate that S1's harassment of Complainant affected a term or condition of employment, unreasonably interfered with the work environment, and created an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment. The Commission has held that claims that allege a change in assignment of duties sufficiently state an injury or harm to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which a remedy can be provided. <span class="Italic">See Pachecho v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120093186 (Jan. 26, 2010); <span class="Italic">Banner v. Dep't of Veteran Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120093470 (Nov. 12, 2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that S1 cursed and screamed at her. Complainant also alleged that S1 physically assaulted her. When S1 swung her body from side to side and repeatedly hit Complainant with her body, the contact was unwelcome. This is further evidenced by Complainant's stated disbelief that S1 was hitting her, and her attempt to move away from S1. Complainant recounted another incident where she felted violated when S1 grabbed her arm and patted her on the shoulder. The Agency's FAD noted that, "[m]ore than one person described [S1's] actions as 'abusive' and 'hostile.'" RN2 attested repeatedly in his affidavit that S1 chased Complainant down the hall while yelling at her. Complainant recounted two incidents where S1 physically assaulted her. In the first instance, S1 swung her body to repeatedly make contact with Complainant. In the second incident, S1 grabbed Complainant's arm and patted Complainant's shoulder. While the latter incident is seemingly innocent and/or neutral, it occurred after S1 was issued two "cease and desist" letters with regards to Complainant, along with two investigations and an allegation of assault. Complainant stated that S1's grabbing of her arm and patting her shoulder felt like a violation. While S1 denied these allegations, she also denied ever raising her voice at or screaming at Complainant. However, several witnesses attested to witnessing S1 scream and yell at Complainant, and even chase after Complainant while doing so. As stated above, the corroboration of of S1's alleged acts give greater weight to Complainant's allegations against S1. Again, when viewed from the position of a reasonable person in Complainant's position, the harassment unreasonably interfered with the work environment and created an intimidating and hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find Complainant's description of events to be more credible than S1's. While some of Complainant's allegations are not corroborated, many of them are. Numerous witnesses attested to S1 screaming at Complainant to the extent that the yelling could be heard throughout offices, through closed doors, and into hallways. One witness even attested to witnessing S1 chase Complainant while screaming at her. In contrast, S1 denies even yelling at Complainant. As such, we find Complainant's testimony to hold more weight than S1's, and Complainant has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that S1's actions were motivated by both race-and sex-based animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to element (5), an employer is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 2270 (1998); <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2292-93 (1998). However, where the harassment does not result in a tangible employment action the agency can raise an affirmative defense, which is subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, by demonstrating: (1) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior; and (2) that complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Industries, supra</span>; <span id="Page_925"></span><span class="Italic">Faragher, supra; Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). This defense is not available when the harassment results in a tangible employment action (e.g., a discharge, demotion, or reassignment) being taken against the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously discussed, we find that there was a tangible employment action. However, even if a tangible employment action did not exist, the Agency has failed to act in a manner to raise an affirmative defense. The Agency was made aware of S1's conduct from Complainant after the incident in March 2017 and issued S1 a cease and desist letter and offered training. However, the training for S1 was optional and the record indicates that efforts were made to discuss the behavior of both individuals. But S1 was the aggressor and harassed Complainant. It was S1's conduct that was an issue. The measures taken by the Agency were insufficient to stop the alleged harassing behavior by S1, yet it took the same measures a second time after the behavior continued and escalated to a physical assault. S1 continued after each investigation to be Complainant's supervisor. It was the Agency's responsibility to prevent the harassment. We find that the Agency failed to satisfy the first condition of raising an affirmative defense, in that it did not prevent or promptly correct the harassing behavior of S1 and therefore, we find the Agency liable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has shown that she was subjected to harassment based on her race and sex for which the Agency is liable.</p>
