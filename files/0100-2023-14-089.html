<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-89"><span class="space">G.</span> DISCRIMINATORY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will not consider an allegation that a settlement agreement benefiting one party is discriminatory as to other parties in the absence of an additional allegation of bad faith. <span class="Italic">See Templer v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01994043 (2002). In order to state a claim, the complainant must specifically allege that the settlement agreement at issue was executed in order to discriminate against that party. The Commission does have jurisdiction over an allegation that a settlement agreement which benefits one party was entered into with the intent of disadvantaging another party who has been subject to discrimination. The Commission explored the distinction between these two situations in <span class="Italic">Bhuller v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910523 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Commission's previous decision correctly stated, the courts and the Commission have held that as a matter of law, conciliation agreements which settle EEO complaints may not be considered independent acts of discrimination against those not benefitted [sic] by the agreement "unless there are allegations of bad faith in making the agreement, that is, allegations that the agreement was not a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> attempt to conciliate a claim but rather an attempt to bestow unequal employment benefits under the guise of remedying discrimination." <span class="Italic">EEOC v. McCall Printing Corp.</span>, 633 F.2d 1232, 1237-38 (6th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Carey v. United States Postal Service</span>, 812 F.2d 621, 624-25 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">William H. Snapp v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890439 (August 3, 1989). In accordance with this view, the Commission has held that an allegation of discrimination based on another party's settlement agreement fails to state a claim, where there has been no showing that the agreement was executed in bad faith, on the grounds that to remand such allegations would discourage voluntary conciliation of complaints. <span class="Italic">Louis T. Faison v. H. Lawrence Garrett, III, Secretary, Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900956 (October 12, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's previous decision found that appellant had not alleged, nor did the record reflect, that the agency entered into the settlement agreement at issue in an attempt to bestow unequal benefits under the guise of remedying discrimination. The Commission concluded that there was no evidence that the agency executed the settlement agreement in bad faith. However, upon further reflection and reconsideration of appellant's allegations, the Commission finds that in essence, appellant has been alleging throughout the processing of this matter that the settlement agreement at issue was entered into in bad faith. Appellant has consistently maintained that the Selectee was not qualified for the position, that the agency abused its own promotion policies, and that appellant's own record of prior protected EEO activity has resulted in the agency's consistent failure to select him for positions such as the one at issue. Appellant also maintained that the agency has not complied with settlement agreements entered into with appellant, which would have permitted his selection for the...position. In support of his allegations, appellant points to a significant delay by the agency in making a selection decision, following the certification of the five best qualified candidates in May, 1989. Appellant notes that the Selectee did not even request EEO counseling until November, 1989, and that the settlement agreement was not executed until January 1990, almost one year after the Vacancy Announcement was issued. The record fails to contain any explanation for the agency's delay....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Grasso v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A05316 (2002); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Attorney General</span>, 01A10935 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also has held, without reference to <span class="Italic">Bhuller</span>, that irrespective of its basis, a claim of discrimination cannot be grounded in a claim related <span id="Page_406"></span>to a settlement offer. In <span class="Italic">Montague v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05920321 (1992), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also finds that appellants may not base a constructive discharge claim on the agency's allegedly discriminatory settlement offer of July 18, 1990. First, we find that she fails to state a claim as a factual matter because the record shows that the offer postdated her resignation. Clearly, an action that occurred more than a month after appellant's resignation could not be the reason for the resignation. In addition, we find that the offer does not give rise to a viable allegation as a matter of law. First, appellant was not aggrieved by virtue of the offer; <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it did not adversely affect a term, condition or privilege of appellant's employment. Appellant took the action available to her by rejecting the offer. She may not thereafter use it as the grounds for a new complaint. Moreover, in the Commission's view, settlement negotiations, including any statements and proposals made therein, are to be treated as confidential and privileged in order to facilitate candid interchange to settle disputes informally. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Olitsky v. Spencer Gifts, Inc.</span>, 842 F.2d 123, 126-127 (5th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 488 U.S. 925 (1988). To allow appellant to base a new complaint on a settlement offer would defeat this purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Montague</span> probably should not be understood as overruling <span class="Italic">Bhuller</span>. In <span class="Italic">Montague</span>, no settlement was ever reached, and the Commission's decision can likely be understood as excluding only allegations of discrimination that relate to offers of settlement. As the Commission noted, the complainant took the action available to her by rejecting the offer of settlement. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Estus v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01970072 (1997) ("[A] settlement agreement between an employer and a third party may not be considered an independent act of discrimination, unless there are allegations that the agreement is an attempt to bestow unequal employment benefits under the guise of remedying discrimination rather than a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> effort to settle a claim."); <span class="Italic">Carey v. USPS</span>, 812 F.2d 621 (10th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The reinstatement of an employee who improperly touched the complainant, pursuant to a settlement agreement between the agency and the employee, does not aggrieve the complainant for purposes of stating a claim. In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Secretary of Navy, U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 02960002 (1998), the Commission, citing <span class="Italic">Bhuller</span>, found there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the agency. However, the Commission did caution the agency that it must take "all necessary steps" to ensure a work environment free from sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, a supervisor who is reassigned as the result of a settlement agreement with a subordinate complainant has no claim of discrimination unless he can prove the settlement was entered in bad faith for the purpose of retaliating or discriminating against him. For example, in <span class="Italic">Abernethy v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01956335 (1999), a class complaint was settled by providing for reassignment of a supervisor who was not part of the putative class. Although the Commission found the judge erred by certifying the class, it further found the supervisor made no showing of bad faith in entering the agreement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Abernethy</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency witnesses explained that appellant's reassignment was one of the terms of a settlement agreement entered into between management and the agent of a class of current and former female employees under appellant's supervision alleging he had fostered a discriminatory and harassing work environment. Appellant has argued that the agency used the settlement agreement as a pretext for reassigning him in retaliation for his EEO representational activities. It has been the Commission's policy that a settlement agreement may not be considered an independent act of discrimination against those not benefited by the agreement, unless there is proof of bad faith in the making of the agreement. Proof of "bad faith" in these circumstances would require a showing that the agency entered into the settlement agreement for the express purpose of retaliating against appellant under the guise of remedying discrimination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Raimer v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930735 (April 1, 1994); <span class="Italic">Bhuller v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910523 (August 1, 1991); <span class="Italic">Faison v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900956 (October 12, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that bad faith motivated the agency to enter into the settlement agreement with the employees who filed the class complaint against him. First, appellant never alleged that agency officials contrived or devised the complaints forming the class action. Second, the AJ implied bad faith existed when he found the class complaint did not have to be settled by the agency because it would never have been certified for lack of numerosity. However, the AJ erred in finding the class consisted of only three members. The AJ, in fact, did not know the extent of the class membership, which was to potentially include current and past employees under appellant's supervision in both the Atlanta and Birmingham offices. Appellant, in his brief, has asserted that he supervised over 100 employees over the years. How many were female is not apparent from the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also concluded that the unprecedented nature of the convening of a management group to review the class counselor's report, and the history of hostility between appellant and the District Director, established a retaliatory motivation for the decision to reassign appellant. The AJ noted the District Director's involvement in the class counseling process by pointing to evidence that the District Director met with the class counselor on four separate occasions and indicated a desire to settle the matter. However, despite this involvement and any hostility he may have felt for appellant, the Commission finds that the evidence conclusively establishes that the District Director made no unilateral determination about the allegations against appellant and what course to pursue. Instead he maintained distance from the decision by convening a group of managers, including agency EEO officials, to review the class counselor's report and make recommendations to him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making the decision to convene the group of managers to review the class counselor's report, the Commission finds it significant that the District Director was fully aware that similar allegations had been raised about appellant the year before in the panel inquiry. At that time, management decided it had insufficient evidence to take any action, in part because appellant's employees were unwilling to put their verbal responses into signed written statements. This time, however, the employees were not only willing to provide written affidavits, but were insisting that management take action against appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After meeting for two days and reviewing the affidavits gathered by the class counselor, the management group unanimously agreed that the situation warranted appellant's immediate removal from the supervision of the group. There was no testimony that the District Director made any attempt to influence the group decision-making process. Rather, the District Director accepted the managers' recommendation and arranged for appellant's lateral reassignment to a nonmanagement position. He was later able to settle the class complaint based primarily on this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All the managers who reviewed the class counselor's report testified at the hearing about their impression that the allegations against appellant had merit and were sufficiently serious and widespread to warrant a decision that he was no longer effective as the supervisor of the group. The testimony of appellant's first-level supervisor was particularly persuasive as the evidence indicates that before he read the class counselor's report he had been an advocate of appellant's actions. However, the supervisor testified that after reading the affidavits, he saw, for the first time, appellant's actions from the employees' "perspective" and realized how "disturbed" they felt. He noted that he was particularly concerned that former employees were willing to give statements, and that read together, all the affidavits painted a picture of a dysfunctional work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of appellant's subordinates also testified at the hearing and essentially corroborated the allegations made against appellant in the class complaint. For example, one of appellant's senior attorneys (female), who appellant apparently relied upon to act in his absence, testified that although she, herself, was not intimidated by appellant, she found appellant's management style to be "very negative, very unproductive." She also validated that many other female employees in the group perceived appellant's conduct towards them as harassing. She characterized appellant as "very smart" but "his connections to the real world didn't always seem rational." She concluded that she believed it was in the best interests of the agency to remove appellant from management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the testimony of the managers involved in the decision to reassign appellant, as well as the employees who had worked under appellant's supervision, and an independent review of the EEO class counselor's report, the Commission concludes that it is more likely than not that it was appellant's own treatment of his employees, and not his EEO activities, which resulted in the decision to reassign him from his supervisory position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Bowman v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A20746 (2002), the Commission held that a supervisor was not aggrieved when the agency settled a sexual harassment claim that was brought against him. In the absence of any evidence of bad faith, the complaint failed to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01956287 (1996), the Commission explained what kind of allegation would demonstrate sufficient bad faith on the part of the agency to challenge a settlement agreement as discriminatory:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant alleges that he was discriminated against when a position was awarded to a white, male employee pursuant to a settlement agreement. The Commission has held that settlement agreements may not be considered independent acts of discrimination against those not benefitted by them, unless there is an allegation of bad faith in the making of the agreement, such that it is a discriminatory attempt to bestow unequal benefits under the guise of remedying discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Raimer v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930735 (April 1, 1994); <span class="Italic">Faison v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900956 (October 12, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_407"></span>Appellant has alleged that the agency knew the position in question would be open prior to the time it was offered as part of the settlement agreement. Appellant has also alleged that the agency subsequently included this position in the settlement agreement, instead of announcing the job and soliciting applications, in order to prevent Black males from competing for the position. In short, appellant has alleged that the agency used the settlement agreement as a pretext for continuing its practice of refusing to promote black males to high-level supervisory positions. The Commission finds that appellant has sufficiently alleged that the settlement agreement was entered in bad faith, as defined by our decisions<span class="Italic">. See Raimer, supra; Faison, supra</span>. Therefore, he has stated a claim under our regulations, and is entitled to an investigation of his allegations<span class="Italic">. See Bhuller v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910523 (August 1, 1991); <span class="Italic">Walsh v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01920846 (April 29, 1992); <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01920567 (March 10, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A61016 (2006), the Commission held that the complainant failed to state a claim by alleging disparate treatment because a white female was offered a permanent promotion in a settlement agreement and he was offered only a temporary promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a complainant may state a claim by alleging that a settlement agreement is discriminatory, generally, no claim may be made with respect to an agency's conduct during settlement negotiations. In <span class="Italic">Pledger v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01953498 (1996), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant alleged that he was discriminated against when the agency withdrew a settlement offer made on a prior complaint that would have provided him with an immediate promotion to a GS-7 position with a target grade of GS-12, as a Patients Assistance Supervisor. We find that this allegation fails to state a claim. We have previously found that settlement negotiations, including any statements and proposals therein, are to be treated as confidential and privileged in order to facilitate a candid interchange to settle disputes informally. To allow appellant to base an allegation in the instant complaint on the impropriety of the agency's withdrawal of a settlement offer in a previously filed complaint would defeat this purpose<span class="Italic">. See Harvey Harris v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05941002 (March 23, 1995). Accordingly, this allegation of appellant's complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible, however, that an agency could engage in employment discrimination during the course of settlement negotiations. An employee's hearing disability affecting his ability to communicate may provide a basis for voiding any settlement agreement reached in negotiations that do not reasonably accommodate the employee by providing a certified interpreter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dardis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924524 (1993) (relying, in part, on the failure of the agency to provide a certified interpreter in holding that the settlement agreement was discriminatory).</p>
<p class="noindent">In litigation, the Commission takes the view that evidence of other settlement agreements ordinarily is not probative on the ultimate issue of discrimination. As a result, a complainant may not introduce evidence that a similarly situated employee outside of the complainant's protected category was treated more favorably through settlement. This view was explained in <span class="Italic">Belknap v. Postmaster General</span>, 03930027 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[G]enerally, differences between MSPB, grievance, and EEO settlements terms do not provide probative evidence of employment discrimination. The courts have noted that factors leading to such settlements are imprecise, and that public policy generally favors settlements on grounds other than fault. The courts and the EEOC have been reluctant to find discrimination based solely on evidence of differences in settlement of grievances, MSPB matters, or EEO complaints, absent strong proof of bad faith or a pattern of substantial disparity in such. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. McCall Printing Corp.</span>, 633 F.2d 1232, 1238 Cir. 1980)....</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges that an agency has breached an MSPB settlement agreement in a discriminatory fashion, the allegation is properly processed as an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Siaz v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01931758 (1993). The agency may not dismiss such a complaint on the basis that the MSPB has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the Commission also has held that it has no jurisdiction to enforce a settlement that is reached in the informal grievance process involving a grievance which raised no issues of discrimination. This is true even when the employee complains that the agency's failure to adhere to the settlement is discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Ruggiero v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961598 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant cannot agree to resign in a settlement agreement and then file a complaint that his resignation was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Hult v. Secretary of Treasury, IRS</span>, 01962490 (1996).</p>
