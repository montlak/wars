<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-73"><span class="space">1.</span> Accent Discrimination</h4>
<p class="noindent">Separate from the issue of actual language fluency is the problem of linguistic characteristics that result in an accent when English is spoken. The EEOC closely scrutinizes employment decisions based on accent. Section V, A, of the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span> provides useful commentary and examples to illustrate accent discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An accent can reflect whether a person lived in a different country or grew up speaking a language other than English. National origin and accent are therefore intertwined, and employment decisions or harassment based on accent may violate Title VII. Due to the link between accent and national origin, courts take a "very searching look" at an employer's reasons for using accent as a basis for an adverse employment decision. Courts require employers to provide evidence--as opposed to unsupported assertions--to explain such actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, an employment decision may legitimately be based on an individual's accent if the accent "interferes materially with job performance." To meet this standard, an employer must provide evidence showing that: (1) effective spoken communication in English is required to perform job duties; and (2) the individual's accent materially interferes with his or her ability to communicate in spoken English.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the evidence shows that an individual has a good command of spoken English or satisfactorily performs his job when speaking accented English, courts have ruled against employers under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 22</p>
<p class="noindent-2">National Origin Discrimination Involving Accent</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Chinasa, an experienced retail professional who works for National Retailer, speaks English with a Nigerian accent. National Retailer selects Chinasa for a Regional Loss Prevention Manager position. An executive who will oversee Chinasa's work approaches her immediately after the promotion and comments, "I bet this is a great achievement considering where you came from. As an African, you must be the first to achieve this much success in your family given your accent." The executive tells Chinasa to "try to speak more like an American" and also to be careful about her demeanor because, in his opinion, "Africans are known to be brash and aggressive." The executive repeats these comments on several occasions during Chinasa's first several months on the job. There is no evidence, however, that staff members misinterpret or do not understand Chinasa's spoken English. In fact, the evidence shows that staff members respond promptly to Chinasa's directions without seeking clarification and provide information that is responsive to her requests. Nonetheless, after nine months, the executive terminates Chinasa's employment, telling her that she is a "poor fit" for the Regional Loss Prevention Manager position. When Chinasa requests further explanation, he cites discomfort with her "thick African accent,"asserts that some staff members do not understand her, and laments that she did not speak "more like an American." Based on these facts, the EEOC finds reasonable cause to believe that National Retailer discriminated against Chinasa because of her national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether an individual's accent materially interferes with the ability to perform job duties, the key is to distinguish a merely discernible accent from one that actually interferes with the spoken communication skills necessary for the job. Evidence of an accent materially interfering with job duties may include documented workplace mistakes attributable to difficulty understanding the individual; assessments from several credible sources who are familiar with the individual and the job; or specific substandard job performance that is linked to failures in spoken communication.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 23</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No National Origin Discrimination Involving Accent: Accent Materially Interferes with Job Performance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Discount Airline needs to hire a customer service agent at a major metropolitan airport to provide in-person assistance for passengers who have missed their connections or whose flights have been cancelled or delayed. This position requires short but effective spoken communication in a noisy environment with a disgruntled public. Romel, who speaks English with a pronounced Filipino accent, applies for the position and is invited for an interview. The interviewing process includes a job simulation during which the applicant responds to customers in an atmosphere that mimics that of a busy airport. Two experienced interviewers who understand <span id="Page_1032"></span>the demands of this job are impressed by Romel's calm demeanor and commitment to problem-solving, but they have difficulty understanding Romel's spoken English during the interview process. The interviewers conclude that Romel's pronounced Filipino accent will materially interfere with effective spoken communication in this environment. As a result, Romel is not hired. Romel challenges his rejection as national origin discrimination involving his accent. The EEOC does not find reasonable cause to believe that Romel was subjected to national origin discrimination because effective oral communication is required for this position, and Romel's accent materially interferes with his ability to communicate effectively in the circumstances of this job.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">National Origin Discrimination Involving Accent: Accent Does Not Materially Interfere with Job Performance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mariam, who speaks with a discernible Lebanese accent, is an experienced English-language teacher who earned an American graduate degree in education after moving to the United States with her American husband. Mariam's graduate school professors commended her demonstrated ability to engage high school students. High School hired Mariam as a permanent substitute teacher for humanities courses. Teachers at High School specifically requested her as a substitute teacher because it is clear to them that the students learn the assigned material when she teaches.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mariam subsequently applies and is rejected for three permanent teaching jobs at High School. The School District's hiring official explains that effective communication in English is required for classroom teachers, and Mariam is not qualified because she speaks with a Lebanese accent. Although effective communication in English is required to teach at High School, Mariam's accent does not materially interfere with her ability to do so, as demonstrated by the statements of other High School teachers and her graduate school professors. Mariam states a claim for national origin discrimination involving her accent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employer takes an employment action in response to the discriminatory preferences of others, the employer itself is discriminating. Employers may not rely on coworker, customer, or client discomfort or preference to justify a discriminatory employment action based on accent.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency asserts that a foreign accent interferes with the complainant's ability to perform a specific job, the administrative judge must assess whether, in fact, the accent would actually do so. "Evidence concerning whether appellant's accent could be understood by coworkers, and/or supervisors is probative on this question." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01881467 (1988). The Commission rejected speculation that although the complainant was understood by coworkers and supervisors, she would not be understood by the agency's clientele, inner city Blacks, absent actual proof. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Kochhar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966813 (1998), the administrative judge "took judicial notice of the fact that the appellant's foreign accent did not interfere with his ability to communicate at the hearing, and noted 'that not once, in two days and 213 pages of testimony, did the Court Reporter ask for a clarification' of any statements made by the appellant." Likewise, summary judgment may be less of an appropriate vehicle to resolve cases involving accent discrimination because of the need for the administrative judge to evaluate both the complainant's accent and the selecting official's evaluation of the accent. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Tungjunyatham v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A55397 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Judgment as a matter of law should not have been granted in this case because the record contains genuine issues for trial. Here, the selecting officials assert that complainant had an unsatisfactory command of the English language, and that the position in question required an ability to communicate clearly both verbally and in writing. In response, complainant asserts that she fulfilled all English Language requirements to be eligible for employment with the agency. She states that "it is very known fact that immigrants from Pacific Rim Asian countries (Korea, Thailand, etc.) generally speak with thick accent, so Selecting Officials' remarks that Complainant's verbal skills were insufficient are grossly biased against immigrants." Complainant's Opposition to Agency's April 29, 2005 Motion for Summary Judgment ("Opposition"), at 5. Complainant also notes that she "successfully performed all tasks as a Veterinary Medical Officer in a large slaughter plant where daily oral and written communication with USDA, inspectors, plant management, officials, and plant employees was part of her job. She was rated fully successful in all job elements during her three years stay with USDA..." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that the AJ erred in determining, without first holding a hearing, that the successful candidates exceeded complainant significantly in written and oral communication skills. A hearing is required to determine whether the selecting officials' are credible in describing the reasons for their poor assessment of complainant's written and oral communication skills. There is also a related question for trial as to whether the Selecting Officials found complainant's responses to questions difficult to understand because of the substance of how she replied, as they allege, or because of her accent, as complainant alleges. The AJ erred in stating that it is undisputed that the officials analyzed complainant's substantive responses, not her accent. Complainant specifically asserts that the Selecting Officials considered her accent, and discriminated against her on that basis. The AJ erred in crediting, without holding a hearing, the Selecting Officials' explanations that it was the substance of complainant's responses, and not her accent, that caused her to be not qualified for the position she sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, this case requires further analysis of whether complainant was able to communicate in English satisfactorily to perform the essential functions of her job, and/or whether her accent would "materially interfere" with her job performance. <span class="Italic">See Daly v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933547 (September 14, 1995); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span>, at 19-20 (December 3, 2002) ("An employment decision based on foreign accent does not violate Title VII if an individual's accent materially interferes with the ability to perform job duties. This assessment depends upon the specific duties of the position in question and the extent to which the individual's accent affects her ability to perform job duties. Employers should distinguish between a merely discernible foreign accent and one that interferes with communication skills necessary to perform job duties."). As noted above, the position in question is a Veterinary Medical Officer position, and although the agency officials state that outreach is one of the Veterinary Medical Officer's duties, a hearing is necessary to determine whether complainant could communicate in English well enough to perform her duties, including outreach duties, adequately.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dudday v. Security and Exchange Commission</span>, 01882078 (1988), the Commission found discrimination on the basis of consideration of an accent in nonselecting the complainant where only two of six critical job elements called for any oral communications skills at all and the selecting official testified that he considered what impact that accent would have on those skills. (The <span class="Italic">Dudday</span> case also is good reading on how to prepare an appeal. For each contention of the appeal, the appellant was able to cite specific testimony via transcript pages that supported his contention. Appellants and agencies alike would do well to take note.) However, while comments regarding a complainant's accent or language skills may raise an inference of national origin discrimination, "merely asking questions about any languages Complainant might speak or expressing an inability to understand a person's manner of speaking do not necessarily reflect animus based upon national origin." <span class="Italic">King W. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152004 (2017) (a past inquiry by the recommending official, for whom the complainant had previously worked, concerning the complainant's nationality and whether anyone could speak the complainant's language, was not evidence of discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Employer or customer preference for 'unaccented' English is insufficient justification for a discriminatory practice." <span class="Italic">Park v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05870646 (1988). The fact that corporate taxpayers prefer to deal with Caucasian agents reflects a customer preference and not actual performance.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a distinction between language fluency and accent. Accent relates to pronunciation, while fluency relates to the ability to utilize such things as proper sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01890963 (1989), the complainant, a Cuban-Hispanic, alleged that she was discriminated against because of her accent when the agency selected a Puerto Rican-Hispanic for a position in Puerto Rico. The Commission noted that the selection panel had based its recommendation, in part, upon the written applications of the candidates which indicated the selectee had better language fluency skills in English. The Commission found it was not unreasonable for the panel to conclude the selectee was more fluent in English and that such fluency was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory factor to rely upon because 10-15% of the position involved communicating in English.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employer may only base an employment action on accent when "it interferes materially with job performance." <span class="Italic">Emperado v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01930541 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Fragante v. Honolulu</span>, 51 FEP 190 (9th Cir. 1989)). Accent is more likely to justify an employer's decision when it is combined with syntax and grammar errors that make speech confusing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shah v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05901097 (1992), the Commission determined that it would closely scrutinize cases where accent was advanced as a reason for the agency's actions. But the Commission also found in <span class="Italic">Shah</span> that the agency was not required to prove that a complainant's accent was so strong that he or she was incomprehensible:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now will address the arguments made by appellant in his request to reopen. With regard to appellant's first assertion that his accent needed to be proven to be severe or incomprehensible in order for him to be reassigned, we must point out that our policy guidance indicates that a foreign accent that interferes with an employee's ability to perform a task can constitute a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for an adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Compl. Man., Vol. II, (CCH), Section 623, Appendix C, Policy Document: Discrimination Based on Manner of Speaking or Accent (hereinafter Policy Document) Pp. 36-37 (1989). <span id="Page_1033"></span>While the example of an instructor who speaks with an accent so strong that it makes him or her incomprehensible to the students is given, appellant's cited performance difficulties did not involve his capability as an instructor, but involved problems in communicating orally and in writing with coworkers and management officials in order to resolve deficiencies in the Target Rock program over which appellant had coordinator responsibilities. Our policy guidance in this area indicates that it is necessary to determine if the charging party's accent had a detrimental effect on job performance and that such an inquiry can be accomplished by interviewing the charging party and his or her coworkers and by looking at the actual duties of the job to determine what types of communications are required. Policy Document, p. 37. In this regard, we have reviewed the duties of appellant's position which we find to require effective communication skills and have weighed the testimony of the coworker witnesses who dealt with appellant through the course of their duties and the testimony of appellant's supervisors. We find this essentially unrebutted testimony to be dispositive in upholding the finding of our previous decision that appellant failed to prove his alleged communications difficulties to be a pretext for national origin discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Myrick v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05920415 (1992), the Commission further explained how accent can legitimately be considered by an agency in making employment decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her request to reopen, appellant argues that the Commission in its previous decision did not closely scrutinize the charge of national origin discrimination in terms of appellant's manner of speaking as it was obliged to under <span class="Italic">Shah v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901097 (March 21, 1991). Appellant suggests that the motivating reason for not selecting appellant for promotion was her foreign accent, and that under <span class="Italic">Shah</span>, when a federal agency denies an employment opportunity because an individual's foreign accent makes communication in English difficult, the Commission must closely scrutinize such charges as this reason may be a cover for unlawful discrimination. According to appellant, the Commission's previous decision did not even address the issue of appellant's accent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the previous decision did in fact implicitly address appellant's foreign accent by its references to her communication difficulties, however. Appellant's accent is merely one aspect of her communication abilities, and the decision discusses in detail appellant's oral and written communication skills and those skills in light of the job requirements. To begin with, the vacancy announcement in this case stated that, among other factors, the candidates would be rated on their written communication skills. The selecting official testified that oral communication skills were also an important part of the vacant position's advisory nature. Appellant acknowledged that as a Claims Examiner, she was required, from time to time, to meet with and advise employees from other agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision states that appellant's fourth level supervisor, the selecting official, testified that she had distinct difficulties with oral communication, including rapid speech and "the way she chose to construct her sentences." <span class="Italic">Myrick v. Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913421, at 3 (January 22, 1992). Appellant's immediate supervisor testified that appellant had difficulty with oral and written communication. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 4. A supervisor in the typing department testified that he had received appellant's written work from 1983 to 1989 and that he generally had to edit it before giving it to a typist, because of the misspelled words, grammatical errors, and incomplete sentences. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus we find that the Commission's previous decision analyzed and considered the broad range of appellant's communication skills, including and in addition to her foreign accent. Put another way, the issue of appellant's foreign accent was only one of many aspects of her communication skills. There was testimony from multiple witnesses that appellant had difficulty with both written communication, a clear job requirement, and oral communication, an aspect considered to some degree. Furthermore, the Commission made a sound decision based on other factors vital to the legal analysis, including the selecting official's testimony that the selectee had exceptional writing and analytical skills, appellant had demonstrated rote and cursory analytical skills, that the selectee was overall best qualified, and that appellant was not even his second choice for the position at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we explicitly apply the law set forth in <span class="Italic">Shah</span> and other relevant cases, we find that the previous decision correctly decided the case before it. An adverse employment decision may be predicated upon an employee's foreign accent only where it interferes materially with job performance. <span class="Italic">Fragante v. City &#x0026; County of Honolulu</span>, 888 F.2d 591 (9th Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1811 (1990); <span class="Italic">Carino v. University of Oklahoma Board of Regents</span>, 750 F. 2d 815 (10th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Mejia v. New York Sheraton Hotel</span>, 459 F. Supp. 375 (S.D.N.Y. 1978); <span class="Italic">Shah</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901097 (March 21, 1991); <span class="Italic">Lal v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900318 (June 28, 1990). Accordingly, under Title VII, a foreign accent that does not interfere with an employee's abilities to perform the duties of a job is not a legitimate justification for a nonselection. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, the testimony was unrefuted that communication skills, written and oral, were an important part of the position at issue. Furthermore, the existence of another legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an employment decision--unrelated to the manner of speaking--precludes a finding of national origin discrimination. <span class="Italic">Bell v. Home Life Insurance Co</span>., 596 F. Supp. 1549 (M.D.N.C. 1984) (discharge based on plaintiff's failure to sell required amounts of insurance). Here, appellant's supervisor testified that appellant, unrelated to her foreign accent, demonstrated rote and cursory analytical skills. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant has not provided any basis for reopening the Commission's previous decision, and we will deny her request.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that accent becomes inconsequential when the agency has a reason, independent of the complainant's accent, for making its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Stone v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A02572 (2001), the Commission found that the agency's reliance on the complainant's accent in not selecting her for promotion constituted direct evidence of discrimination and that the agency had failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would not have promoted the complainant even absent discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the merits of complainant's claim, we note that Commission regulations make it unlawful to deny an individual equal opportunity due to the "linguistic characteristics of a national origin group." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1606.1. The Commission has held that an adverse employment decision may be predicated upon an employee's foreign accent only where it interferes materially with the job performance<span class="Italic">. See Daly v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01933547 (September 14, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record establishes that since late 1992/early 1993, the two individuals most directly involved with the decisions not to promote complainant to a career ladder Budget Analyst position, SO and RO, have stated numerous times that complainant would never be promoted because her accent made her too hard to understand. The agency acknowledged in its FAD that complainant's accent would not have interfered with her ability to perform the Budget Analyst job. This is direct evidence of discrimination in that it demonstrates on its face a bias against a protected group and is linked to the complained of adverse action, here, non-promotion and denial of promotion opportunities to the Budget Analyst career ladder position, from 1993 to present<span class="Italic">. See</span> Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span> (Recent Developments), No. 915.002., p. 6 (July 14, 1992). Indeed, the agency acknowledged that this evidence established that it was motivated by discriminatory animus in not selecting complainant for the October 2, 1997 position. We find, therefore, that the non-selections and denial of promotion opportunities to which complainant was subjected were motivated by discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency may limit its liability for these actions by establishing by clear and convincing evidence that it would not have promoted complainant throughout the period in question even absent discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Day v. Mathews,</span> 530 F.2d 1083, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(c)(1); Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110) (as revised, November 9, 1999), 9-19. The agency failed to meet this burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency eventually dismissed complainant's allegation that she was subjected to a pattern of non-promotion and denial of promotion opportunities to the Budget Analyst career ladder position, it had, at one time, accepted this claim for investigation. The record establishes that on May 18, 1998, five months after complainant formally complained of this treatment, the agency accepted the continuing violation claim for investigation and conducted an investigation. It then dismissed the allegation in the January 14, 2000 FAD. Given that the agency was aware of this claim for more than 3 years and conducted, at the very least, a seven-month investigation into it, we find that it has had ample opportunity to come forward with evidence to establish that even absent discrimination, it would not have promoted complainant to a career-ladder Budget Analyst position between 1993 and October 30, 1997. It has, however, failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to meet this burden. Indeed, except in regard to the October 2 and October 30, 1997 positions, the FAD does not include any explanations for why complainant was denied a promotion to a Budget Analyst career ladder position since 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In regard to the October 2, 1997 selection for a Budget Analyst at the GS 7/9 level with promotion potential to GS-12, the agency asserted that management had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for choosing S1, namely, that they believed she was better qualified to perform the functions of a Budget Analyst at the full performance level. In so testifying, SO noted both complainant and S1 were rated "highly qualified" for the position, but that S1 was enthusiastic and sold herself well, as well as having an excellent work history, some experience with <span id="Page_1034"></span>accounting, an advanced degree, and outstanding references. SO noted that while complainant did a good job at the interview and had technical skills, she lacked certain analytical skills. We note, however, that while this explanation may be a sufficient to meet the agency's usual burden in disparate treatment cases of articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its selection of S1, a mere assertion of a legitimate motive, without additional evidence proving that this motive was a factor in the decision and that it would have independently produced the same result, is not sufficient to meet the agency's burden in a case involving direct evidence of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See</span> Recent Developments, 20. The agency must establish by clear and convincing evidence that S1 would have been selected over complainant even in the absence of an impermissible motive<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> It failed to do so. Indeed, in contrast to management's testimony concerning complainant's qualifications, a review of the record reveals that complainant's last performance review under SO and RO, as well as her most recent performance evaluation under a different supervisor, indicate that complainant is highly successful. Several witnesses testified that complainant often performed work at the Budget Analyst level. Moreover, the official who rated and ranked the applicants for the position in question, ranked complainant higher than S1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the agency failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have assigned S2, rather than complainant, to the Budget Analyst position absent discrimination. Although RO testified that the position was filled noncompetitively and that complainant was therefore not subjected to discrimination, complainant's claim is that RO and SO worked to ensure complainant would not be promoted to a career ladder Budget Analyst position by denying her competitive promotions and by choosing to have numerous positions filled noncompetitively. Direct evidence establishes that RO and SO did not want to promote complainant to a Budget Analyst position because of her accent. Moreover, it is undisputed that RO could have filled this position competitively, but decided against it. Given these facts, the agency cannot satisfy its burden of establishing that S2 would have been promoted instead of complainant even absent discrimination by simply relying on RO's decision to fill the position noncompetitively.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Beckford v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120061174 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Avila v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996939 (2002), the Commission addressed the proper analysis when an agency is motivated, in part, by accent discrimination and, in part, by legitimate reasons:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts and the Commission have held that an adverse employment decision may be predicated upon an employee's foreign accent, that is, an accent other than English, only when it interferes materially with job performance<span class="Italic">. See Odima v. Westin Tucson Hotel Co.</span>, 991 F.2d 595 (9th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">See</span> also Vol. II to App. C., EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 623, Speak-English-only Rules and Other Language Policies (Discrimination Based on Manner of Speaking or Accent). Under Title VII, a foreign accent that does not interfere with an employee's ability to perform the duties of the job is not a legitimate justification for an adverse employment action. Denying employment opportunities, or otherwise implementing adverse employment actions, as a result of a foreign accent which causes communication difficulties may be a "cover" for unlawful discrimination, and will accordingly, be subjected to close scrutiny in a national origin discrimination case<span class="Italic">. See Daly v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933547 (September 14, 1995) <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Myrick v. Department of Veteran Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920415 (July 10, 1992); <span class="Italic">Shah v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05901097 (March 21, 1991); and <span class="Italic">Lal v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900318 (June 28, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an accent or other linguistic characteristic "materially interferes" with job performance, the Commission utilizes a three-part inquiry which includes: (1) the level and type of communication demands in the job; (2) whether the employee's speech was fairly evaluated as to its intelligibility, focusing on indicators of potential bias on the part of the deciding official and a neutral assessment of the employee's speech intelligibility given a non-prejudiced listener; and (3) the level, if any, to which the employee's speech intelligibility would present difficulties in the job at issue, according substantial weight to the future, and how reasonable individuals in the workplace could make provisions for any difficulties understanding the employee<span class="Italic">. See Daly v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC No. 01933547 (September 14, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When applying these factors in the foreign accent analysis, the Commission recognizes that there are at least four major contexts in a selection decision which warrant differing analyses<span class="Italic">. Daly v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC No. 01933547 (September 14, 1995). The first situation is where an employer wholly denies using the employee's accent when making the employment decision at issue (e.g., Claim 4--reassignment to the floater position, herein). In this scenario, where the employer denies that accent formed any part of the employment decision, a straight <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis would be applied, considering, where applicable, evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons in addition to any evidence of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the third context, where accent is limited to be a factor, but one or more other factors were allegedly used in addition, the first determination would be the truth or falsity of the other factors. Where at least one legitimate factor was used (e.g. Claim 3--issuance of the PIP), the next question would be whether the accent would "materially interfere" with job performance, using the three elements noted above. If accent is found to be a "material interference," the use of accent may be considered a permissible factor, and a finding of no discrimination is warranted. If accent is found not to be a "material interference," then the use of accent is an impermissible factor, and a mixed motive analysis would be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the preponderance of the evidence shows that the issuance of the PIP was partly due to management's intolerance toward complainant's accent and partly because of complainant's problems with written communication. For example, the PIP stated that in order to help complainant with her enunciation, complainant needed to "speak slowly and enunciate clearly the words spoken..." In addition, in order to help with complainant's enunciation, the PIP required complainant to "sing to the children in English..." The problem management had with complainant's enunciation could have been better described as complainant's accent. Accordingly, we find that the PIP was partly issued for impermissible reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The PIP cited three examples of written communication problems which were taken from the safety module workbook, and two different children's/incident report forms as follows: (1) Items Needing Attention: "Every is new that for they are in excellent conditions"; (2) What Happen: "Happily playing crawling bump his mouse at the floor"; (3) When Were Parents Notified: "Verbally and we show him where is was at 4:45 <span class="small">P.M.</span> at the 112 room." The written communication problems cited in the PIP and by management are not contested by complainant. Accordingly, we find at least one legitimate factor was used in the issuance of the PIP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question to be addressed is whether the accent would "materially interfere" with job performance, using the three elements noted above. We find that the preponderance of the evidence shows that complainant's speech was sufficiently intelligible and would not reasonably present any difficulties in the job at issue. Specifically, we find that parents and co-workers had no problem understanding complainant. Therefore, we find that complainant's accent did not materially interfere with her job performance. Accordingly, the use of complainant's accent was not a permissible factor in the issuance of the PIP and a mixed motive analysis applies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cases such as this in which discrimination was one of at least two motivating factors for an employment action, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> in which the agency acted on the bases of both lawful and unlawful reasons, are known as "mixed motive" cases. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), an employer could avoid liability in mixed motive cases if it could show that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful factor<span class="Italic">. See Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 228 (1989). However, the CRA effectively overruled the part of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> that allowed an employer to avoid liability in this way. The CRA added Section 703(m) to Title VII, making it clear that a violation is established when a complaining party demonstrates that "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m). Once a complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. Only if the agency is able to make this demonstration, can the complainant's relief be reduced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency has failed to meet its burden in proving that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered complainant's accent. We note that the record is devoid of evidence in support of performance problems requiring a PIP. In addition, the overwhelming evidence in the record indicates that complainant performed her job well. Co-workers and parents all praised complainant's performance. Moreover, we find that given complainant's written job description, three incidents of poor written communication is not substantial enough to warrant a PIP without prior informal discussion. Complainant's written job description does not list written communication skills as a "major duty or responsibility." While the job requires that complainant have a "command of the English language," the preponderance of the evidence indicates that complainant's command of the English language is satisfactory. Accordingly, we find that the agency discriminated against complainant on the basis of her national origin when it issued her a PIP.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Genny L. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 012012279 (2016), where the agency required the complainant to communicate with a contractor through her supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although "[e]mployers sometimes have legitimate business reasons for basing employment decisions on linguistic characteristics...linguistic characteristics are closely associated with national origin. Therefore, <span id="Page_1035"></span>employers should ensure that the business reason for reliance on a linguistic characteristic justifies any burdens placed on individuals because of their national origin." EEOC Compliance Manual Section 13, "National Origin Discrimination," EEOC Notice 915.003 &#x00A7; 13-V (Dec. 2, 2002) (EEOC Compliance Manual on National Origin Discrimination). "Generally, a fluency requirement is permissible only if required for the effective performance of the position for which it is imposed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 13-V.B.1. A "lack of proficiency in English may interfere with job performance in some circumstances but not in others," and an "employer should not require a greater degree of fluency than is necessary for the relevant position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, S1 stated in her affidavit that she and the FAO manager decided to involve a supervisor and a senior auditor in the audit because the contractor complained about a "language barrier" and an inability to understand Complainant's data requests. She stated in her February 28, 2011, e-mail that the contractor claimed not to understand what Complainant was requesting and that this "may or may not have been true." S1's statements, which establish that the Agency took the actions at issue because of Complainant's linguistic characteristics, constitute direct evidence that Complainant's national origin motivated the Agency's actions. <span class="Italic">See Renwick v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112665 (Oct. 20, 2011) (supervisor's statement that complainant did not speak English well enough to be transferred was direct evidence that supervisor's denial of complainant's request for a transfer was motivated by national origin or race); <span class="Italic">Min v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995966 (Jan. 8, 2001) (comments regarding complainant's English language proficiency and accent were direct evidence of discriminatory motivation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence that the Agency attempted to ensure that the contractor's complaints about Complainant's language skills justified prohibiting Complainant from interacting directly with the contractor and requiring her to communicate through a supervisor or senior auditor. On the contrary, S1's e-mail statement (which she quoted in her affidavit) that the contractor's claim "may or may not have been true" establishes that the Agency imposed these restrictions on Complainant without taking any steps to determine whether Complainant's communications with the contractor in fact were not understandable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the evidence of record does not establish that there existed a "language barrier" that justified the Agency's actions. The Agency has not identified any specific data requests or other communications that the contractor claimed it could not understand. Similarly, S1 has not identified any specific problems with Complainant's language skills and has not claimed that she could not understand Complainant. There is no evidence that anyone, in fact, could not understand Complainant. The Agency's assertion, in its final decision, that e-mails in the record "permit the inference that a contractor could be confused...because of the nature of the writing" is unavailing. Drawing an inference from e-mails, all but one of which were written after the discrimination at issue here, that someone "could" be confused does not justify the Agency's actions. The record contains no evidence that Complainant sent any unintelligible e-mails to the contractor. Further, there is no evidence that the recipients of the e-mails in the record had any trouble understanding them. We note, for example, that S1's lengthy reply to Complainant's February 28, 2011, e-mail demonstrates that S1 readily understood Complainant. In addition, having reviewed the e-mails, we find them understandable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 has asserted that she learned on January 18, 2011, that Complainant was in her probationary period and that she took action because of Complainant's "limited experience and a potential issue with the contractor." It is not clear whether S1 learned of Complainant's probationary status before or after she instructed Complainant to communicate with the contractor through a supervisor or senior auditor. To the extent that S1 learned of Complainant's probationary status after she issued the instruction, the information constitutes after-acquired evidence that does not negate the Agency's liability for having engaged in unlawfully discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co</span>., 513 U.S. 352 (1995) (holding that an employee discharged in violation of the ADEA is entitled to relief even if the employer subsequently discovers evidence of wrongdoing that would have led to the employee's termination on legitimate grounds); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on After-Acquired Evidence and</span> <span class="Italic">McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Dec. 14, 1995) (where employer proves that it would have taken the same or harsher adverse action had it known of employee misconduct, complainant will still be entitled to relief, but that relief may be subject to limitation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, to the extent that S1 learned of Complainant's probationary status prior to issuing the instruction, the information likewise does not relieve the Agency of liability for its actions. At most, the evidence would support a mixed-motives analysis. Mixed-motives analysis applies to cases in which there is a finding that discrimination was one of multiple motivating factors for an employment action, i.e., in which the agency acted on the bases of both lawful and unlawful reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>, EEOC: Notice No. 915.002 &#x00A7; III.B.2 (July 14, 1992), <span class="Italic">as modified</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Jan. 16, 2009). Under Title VII, a violation is established "when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). Once a complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. If the agency makes this demonstration, the complainant is not entitled to personal relief such as damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, and back pay but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees, and costs. <span class="Italic">See DeArmas v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060085 (July 26, 2007); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980504 (Apr. 8, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, without so finding, that Complainant's experience level was a factor in the Agency's decision to require her to communicate with the contractor through a supervisor or senior auditor, we find that the Agency has not shown that it would have taken the same action absent consideration of the discriminatory factor. S1 asserted that she required four auditors, whose races and national origins were not disclosed, to have a supervisor or senior auditor review entails, attend meetings, or coordinate with a requester. There is no evidence, however, regarding the auditors' experience levels or the circumstances under which they were required to communicate through a supervisor or senior auditor. Further, there is no evidence regarding the extent to which the Agency did not impose such restrictions on auditors whose level of experience resembled Complainant's. The Agency has not established that, absent the contractor's unsubstantiated complaint about an alleged "language barrier," it would have imposed the same restrictions on Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of national origin when, after the contractor complained of a "language barrier," it required her to communicate with the contractor through a supervisor or senior auditor. We further find that Complainant is entitled to full relief. Having found that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of national origin and is entitled to full relief, we need not determine whether the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of race.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every reference by a supervisor to an employee's accent, however, is deemed evidence of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Mukai v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01A20607.txt">01A20607</a> (2004), the complainant alleged that the supervisor's reference to her accent in a memorandum and in a lunchtime conversation with other employees was part of a hostile environment based on national origin. The Commission found no discrimination where the evidence demonstrated that the supervisor was primarily concerned with the complainant's behavior and not her accent. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mukai</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The main pieces of evidence complainant presents to support her claim of accent-based harassment are a memorandum written by the Supervisor to an instructor in conjunction with a training seminar he attended at the National Advocacy Center in Columbia, South Carolina, and a lunch conversation the Supervisor had with other employees. In the memorandum, the Supervisor stated that he has a Legal Clerk who has great difficulty with speaking and understanding the English language. He speculated that the "Legal Clerk" simultaneously translates what is being said to her into her native language and, as a result, the intended message does not get through. The record indicates that this memorandum was done pursuant to a training course for supervisory attorneys and the Supervisor wanted to discuss this situation as part of the course. The Supervisor did not intend for the memorandum to be seen by complainant nor others within the office. Further, the memorandum also notes that the "Legal Clerk" did not get along with others in the office, "spied" on other employees, had poor phone manners, delegated most of her difficult work to others, and was often confrontational. These portions of the memorandum do not refer to complainant's accent in any way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the lunch conversation, the Supervisor indicated that he sought guidance from those employees who knew complainant for some time. The Supervisor averred that complainant's job performance was adequate, however, he wanted to curtail her behavior problems. There was evidence to show that the complainant's accent was mentioned in the memorandum and lunch conversation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the overall picture of the workplace is one where the Supervisor entered the scene as a new supervisor and an outsider to the employees, and began to change past practices and implement computer programs in an attempt to increase efficiency and impose his own way of operating. The Supervisor testified that he found complainant to generally perform her duties well, but that her behavior was problematic at times. He claimed that when confronted with criticism about her work, complainant would react in a hostile manner, and that she had a tendency to yell and <span id="Page_1036"></span>scream when she was upset. He acknowledged yelling at complainant on a few occasions, but stated that he did so in order to make himself heard over her. Other employees testified that the Supervisor has raised his voice at them as well. Upon review of the record, we find that the environment created within complainant's workplace was not sufficient to show a hostile work environment due to her race, national origin or accent. Accordingly, we conclude that complainant failed to establish her claim of unlawful harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A30033 (2003), the Commission found the complainant stated a claim of disparate impact discrimination when he alleged that Hispanics were disproportionately disadvantaged by an automated voice recognition system that took job applications. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the agency's September 18, 2002 decision dismissing complainant's complaint improper. According to the agency decision, complainant alleges discrimination on the bases of race and national origin when the telephone application process had a disparate impact on individuals of his protected group. Specifically, complainant alleges discrimination on the bases of race and national origin when he was not scheduled for Battery Test # 470, Announcement # 2641 due to an unrecognizable street address which occurred when he called the Postal Service's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) application process. Complainant, on May 17, 2001, allegedly telephoned the toll free number to apply for the position. On September 12, 2001, he learned that his application was not accepted because his street address was unrecognizable. Complainant alleges that the phone application process disparately impacts Hispanics that have English as a second language because the Interactive Voice Recognition does not register the information given from those individuals, thus excluding those callers from receiving interviews. Thus, complainant alleges that he was discriminatorily prevented from successfully applying for a vacancy in the agency. On July 22, 2002, an Administrative Judge (AJ), dismissed complainant's complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(1), for failure to state a claim, finding that the allegations, even if true, do not constitute an unlawful employment practice under the EEO statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Generally, an employer may only base an employment decision on accent if effective oral communication in English is required to perform job duties and the individual's foreign accent materially interferes with his or her ability to communicate orally in English." EEOC Compliance Manual Section, "National Origin Discrimination" No. 915.003, Sec. 13(V)(A) (December 3, 2002). Any other employment decision based on accent may be in violation of Title VII<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> We find that complainant alleges harm to a term, condition, or privilege of employment and, therefore, states a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's decision dismissing complainant's complaint is REVERSED and we REMAND the complaint to the agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not discriminatory for an agency to take into consideration the communication abilities of an employee in an annual performance rating. <span class="Italic">Chen v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01930949 (1993). In addition to the employee's manner of speaking, a trait directly associated with her national origin, the agency also considered a broad range of communication skills, such as grammar, writing and ability to communicate with coworkers during meetings. Those skills "are not related to traits associated with national origin and can be experienced by any employee regardless of national origin...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, any allegation of accent discrimination must be based on national origin. Alleging discrimination on the basis of having a "New York accent" does not state a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Hatzidakis v. Postmaster General</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102381 (2010).</p>
