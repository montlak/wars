<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-33"><span class="space">3.</span> Conduct Directed Toward Others</h4>
<p class="noindent">Conduct directed toward others, whether the complainant was aware of the conduct or not, is relevant in a hostile environment case where the conduct was directed toward others of the same protected category. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064477 (2008). Obviously, if the complainant was unaware of the conduct, it does not go directly to the element of whether the work environment was sufficiently severe or pervasive for that complainant. However, it does support the complainant's contention that the conduct directed at her was sex-based. If the complainant was aware of the conduct, it can contribute to the severity and pervasiveness of the environment even if she did not personally witness the conduct. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Neu v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120100873 (2010) (reversing dismissal of racial and sex-based harassment where complainant personally witnessed some incidents and was told of others).</p>
<p class="noindent">A finding of hostile environment harassment can be based in part on conduct specifically directed toward the complainant and category-based conduct not directed at the complainant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Broomfield v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720110038 (2013) (race based harassment case; "The AJ could properly find and conclude that Complainant was subjected to a racially hostile work environment. Even if Complainant may not have heard all remarks or remarks were not specifically directed toward Complainant, this fact is not dispositive.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although conduct directed toward others may be considered in evaluating whether a work environment is hostile, the fact that the conduct was not directed at the employee can weigh heavily against a finding that the environment was anything more than merely offensive. For example, in <span class="Italic">Black v. Zaring Homes, Inc</span>., 104 F.3d 822 (6th Cir. 1997), the court of appeals reversed a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff because the conduct, which was not directed at the plaintiff, was not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment. The court in <span class="Italic">Black</span>, 104 F.3d at 826-27, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[G]iven the imprecise standard laid down by the <span class="Italic">Harris</span> Court, we might be reluctant to overturn a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff. Nevertheless, although the comments were sex-based, we hold that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that they were severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile work environment. Our conclusion is not based upon an analysis of the comments as isolated events. Rather, viewing the totality of the circumstances, <span class="Italic">see Harris,</span> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S. Ct. at 371, we find that even when construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the conduct does not appear to have been more than "merely offensive," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 21, 114 S. Ct. at 370. While we emphasize that sex-based comments need not be directed at a plaintiff in order to constitute conduct violating Title VII, we note that in this case most of the comments were not directed at plaintiff; this fact contributes to our conclusion that the conduct here was not severe enough to create an objectively hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See cf. Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc</span>., 68 F.3d 525, 541 (1st Cir. 1995) (finding that plaintiffs' allegations were not so severe as to create an objectively hostile educational environment under Title IX, in part because the sexual comments were not directed at the plaintiffs), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 1044, 134 L. Ed.2d 191 (1996). Although the verbal comments were offensive and inappropriate, and the record suggests that defendant's employees did not always conduct themselves in a professional manner, Title VII was "not designed to purge the workplace of vulgarity," <span class="Italic">Baskerville v. Culligan Internat'l Co</span>., 50 F.3d 428, 430 (7th Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the EEOC in its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief urges us to reject the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Baskerville</span>, we find that case helpful. In <span class="Italic">Baskerville</span>, the Seventh Circuit overturned a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff because it found that the facts were insufficient to support a finding of an objectively hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 430. As in this case, the plaintiff's claim was based on verbal conduct only. The court found that the nine allegedly unlawful incidents, spread over seven months, could not reasonably be thought to constitute sexual harassment actionable under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court reached this conclusion not because the alleged harassment was based upon verbal conduct only, but because the conduct did not create an objectively hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC maintains that <span class="Italic">Baskerville</span> improperly ignored the impact that offensive comments have in the context of the workplace, and that we should instead follow the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Harris</span>. Yet, we do not believe that <span class="Italic">Baskerville</span> is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Harris</span> or <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>. The Supreme Court in both decisions recognized that there may be times when offensive comments have an impact in the workplace, indeed constitute "harassment," but do not create an objectively hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S. Ct. at 370; <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405-06. "[N]all workplace conduct that may be described as 'harassment' affects a 'term, condition, or privilege' of employment within the meaning of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405. Our understanding of the analysis in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> and the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> supports our finding that the record here does not establish an objectively hostile work environment. Accordingly, the verdict must be reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the conduct was sexually charged in <span class="Italic">Tom S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120150536 (2017), the Commission found that the complainant was not subjected to a hostile work environment, relying heavily on the fact that it was not directed at the complainant and that some of the conduct was committed outside of the complainant's presence. The conduct at issue in <span class="Italic">Tom S.</span> involved comments made by the complainant's supervisor, including "reach down there and rub that clitty" and "you wouldn't say that if your dick was in my mouth." The Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees with the AJ that, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Complainant, the alleged incidents were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to establish a hostile work environment. Complainant's sexual harassment claim consists of one comment he overheard in April 2012, and reports from co-workers of other inappropriate conduct that they witnessed a year earlier. A single incident or group of isolated incidents will not be regarded as discriminatory harassment unless the conduct is severe. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co</span>., 684 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir. 1982). Regarding the one inappropriate comment that Complainant overheard, the Commission concurs with the AJ that it was not frequent, severe, physically threatening, or an unreasonable interference with Complainant's work performance. Complainant presented no evidence that S1 made any other similar comment directed at him or in his presence. Similarly, with respect to the comments reported by his co-workers, it is undisputed that none of the comments were directed at Complainant and that Complainant did not witness the conduct when it occurred in 2011. While S1's comments were inappropriate and do not belong in the workplace, the Commission finds that the insularity and isolated nature of the conduct at issue was insufficiently severe or pervasive to establish sexual harassment or a discriminatory hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances present, the Commission finds that Complainant's claim fails to rise to the level of objectively unreasonable behavior that would trigger a violation of Title VII. Furthermore, the undisputed record reveals that Agency management took immediate action as soon as the matter was reported in that S2 issued S1 a letter of counseling regarding appropriate workplace behavior and instructed her to take a sexual harassment online training course and a supervisory training course. ROI, at 81, 150. Additionally, S2 again counseled S1 once the 2011 conduct was reported. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant presented no evidence that any similar behavior recurred. Accordingly, the Commission finds no basis to disturb the AJ's summary judgment decision finding that Complainant was not subjected to sexual harassment or a hostile work environment as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the fact that conduct was not directed at the complainant or not witnessed directly by the complainant does not mean the conduct cannot rise to the level of creating a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Scillo v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A62515 (2006), the Commission found that the agency erred in dismissing the complainant's allegations for failure to state a claim where she alleged several of the instances of harassment consisting of things her supervisor had told her about, such as, having sex in an agency stairwell with his girlfriend, having an affair with another man's wife, and sending an email to another female employee about driving a nail through his penis. She also alleged she heard from others about the supervisor's inappropriate behavior, such as, taking a picture of his penis using an agency camera. The Commission found the allegations were sufficient to raise a claim of hostile environment even though the complainant had not witnessed all of the events.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tittle v. Attorney General</span>, 0120102149 (2010), the Commission found that the complainant had stated a hostile environment claim where the sexual conduct was not directed at her, consisted of only one incident, but had been carried out by her supervisor. In that case, the supervisor used the complainant's computer and password to send a sexually offensive email to a female coworker. The agency dismissed the complaint on the basis that she was not aggrieved by the supervisor's actions. On appeal, the Commission, in Tittle, reversed finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant disputes the Agency's final decision finding she was not aggrieved. Complainant argues she has suffered harm to a term, condition, or privilege of her employment. Complainant also disputes that the email is insufficient to show discriminatory harassment. In so arguing, Complainant claims that she has "personally documented other incidents that can be considered sexual harassment/hostile work environment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Walker v. Armed Forces Retirement Home</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A32980 (December 23, 2003), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A40349 (February 4, 2004). In <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, the Commission held that the complainant failed to state a claim where the actions alleged were not directed at the complainant, but instead at a coworker. Accordingly, the Agency did not act in a way that directly harmed the complainant. The Agency asserts that assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that its action was directed at Complainant, the instant formal complaint still fails to state a claim because the single email was not sufficiently severe so as to raise a viable claim of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Analysis and Findings</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as in the instant matter, a complaint does not challenge an <span id="Page_834"></span>agency action or inaction regarding a specific term, condition, or privilege of employment, the claim may survive if it alleges conduct that, if proven true, could be considered sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment and create a hostile or abusive work environment claim. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993); <span class="Italic">Estate of Routson v. Nat'l Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05970388 (February 26, 1999). In applying this standard, the Commission has found that isolated incidents of remarks or comments, unless particularly severe, usually do not create a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved for the purposes of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Backo v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960227 (June 10, 1996); <span class="Italic">Henry v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940695 (February 9, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission has held that, under certain circumstances, the alleged conduct, especially that of a supervisor, is sufficiently egregious so that a single incident may in fact state a hostile work environment claim. This is one of those cases, and we find that Complainant has a viable claim that warrants further investigation. The Agency improperly analyzed the claim, framing the issue as whether the content of the email and to whom the email was sent is sufficient to state a claim of sexual harassment. While the Agency is correct in that the contents of the email were directed at the female coworker and might, under some circumstances, be precluded from investigation by Walker, the Agency overlooked S1's conduct that resulted in the creation and transmission of the email. S1 allegedly used his supervisory authority to obtain the password to complainant's computer under false pretenses, and created an email without Complainant's knowledge that, though short on words, spoke loudly. Based on those allegations, S1 concocted an elaborate, crude, and unprofessional operation that required some conscious thinking. Moreover, his alleged actions put Complainant at risk of being falsely accused of harassing the coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, we find that S1's alleged actions, if proven true, created sufficient potential for harm, including the undermining of the trust needed between supervisor and subordinate, to successfully state a claim of harassment/hostile work environment sufficient to require further investigation. We also note that, on appeal, Complainant asserts that she has "documented other incidents [involving the supervisor] that can be considered sexual harassment/hostile work environment. Complainant should be asked the details of these other incidents during the investigation of her hostile work environment claim.</p>
